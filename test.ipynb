Thousands came out to support her but as the\\xa0story unfolded, Sarvjeet Singh came forth with his version of the events and the tables turned.

This remains the case despite 23 states and the District of Columbia ruling it legal for medical use, and Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska allowing adult recreational use.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Mueller said she would rule within 30 days on a defence argument that the federal government has improperly categorised the drug â meaning that the criminal charges against the nine men before her should be thrown out.\\n\\nHer ruling will only directly affect the case at hand, but if she sides with the defence there will likely be an appeal. That would throw the case up to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit, which covers the nine westernmost US states. It could also prompt lawsuits in other drug cases.\\n\\nThe men appearing before judge Mueller were charged in 2011 with growing marijuana near the city of Redding.\\n\\nIf convicted, they face possible life imprisonment and a $10m fine, plus forfeiture of property and weapons.\\n\\nDefence lawyers have argued that classifying cannabis as a schedule one drug is unlawful, given that the governmentâs own definition of that category is that such drugs have no medical use and are among the most dangerous.\\n\\nâItâs impossible to say that there is no accepted medical use,â said one of the defence attorneys in the case, Zenia Gilg, who has argued that her client was growing marijuana for medical use.\\n\\nAssistant US attorney Gregory Broderick, however, said it was up to Congress to change the law, not the court. He said too few doctors believed that marijuana had medical uses for the definition of the drug to change under the law.\\n\\nâWeâre not saying that this is the most dangerous drug in the world,â he said. âAll weâre saying is that the evidence is such that reasonable people could disagree.â\\n\\nBefore resigning last year, US attorney general Eric Holder announced that he believed the classification of cannabis as a schedule one drug should indeed be reviewed.\\n\\nArcView Group, a cannabis industry investment and research firm based in Oakland, California, issued a report earlier this year claiming that the legal cannabis business is Americaâs fastest growing industry.\\n\\nSales of legal cannabis in the US grew by 74% last year, to $2.7bn.\\n\\nThe defendants in the latest California case are accused of illegally growing marijuana on federal land.\\n\\nâThey had weapons. These guys were not producing medicine,â said Broderick.\\n\\nJudge Mueller has heard a wide-ranging discussion on the merits and demerits of cannabis use, lawyers for each side bringing in experts and citing research.\\n\\nDr Carl Hart, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University who testified for the defence, told the Guardian the paradox between the federal classification of cannabis and its actual legal use was âridiculousâ.\\n\\nHe pointed out that liquid THC, the active ingredient in the cannabis plant, was regulated for medical use by prescription across the country as a schedule three drug commonly used to treat nausea during chemotherapy for cancer patients and appetite loss and wasting in Aids sufferers.\\n\\nâThere is hypocrisy in the system on this,â he said. âThe abuse potential of cannabis is lower than cocaine, amphetamines or morphine, but those are all schedule two drugs. It makes no sense.â\\n\\nHart said the fact that it was even remarkable a judge had agreed to hear the arguments was frustrating, as the debate should already have been had at the federal level.\\n\\nThe prosecution fielded Dr Bertha Madras, a professor of psychobiology at Harvard University, who told the court of her concerns about the dangers of marijuana.\\n\\nThe defence has also referred to research findings from Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, published last year, which concluded that deaths from prescription painkillers had been found to be 25% lower in states where marijuana was legal for medical use.\\n\\nOne of the lead researchers in the study, Dr Colleen Barry, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins, said the federal classification of cannabis should be reconsidered.\\n\\nâMarijuana is increasingly going to be considered in states around the country in the context of legalisation, so I think that we need to change the way we think about scheduling it as a drug,â she told the Guardian.\\n\\nHer research found that in the most recent year studied, 2010, there were 1,700 fewer deaths from overdosing on opiate prescription painkillers in total in the 23 states and DC that allow medical marijuana, compared with the rest of the states.\\n\\nâI think our results suggest that there are potential important benefits of these policies. That does not discount concerns that people have ... but the question of schedule one needs to be reconsidered,â she said.\\n\\nShe said medical marijuana laws had been passed to give people with very painful medical conditions, including cancer and multiple sclerosis, access to pain management alternatives to addictive prescription painkillers such as Percocet and Oxycontin.\\n\\nâCannabis is believed to have some painkilling properties,â she said.\\n\\nCannabis was not associated with overdose deaths, while painkiller deaths were âa major problem in this countryâ, Barry said.\\n\\nHowever, she said, the risks associated with marijuana dependency and the effect of the drug on adolescent brains in particular, as well as children being poisoned by eating edible marijuana products, should all be taken into account and afforded more research.\\n\\nTight federal restrictions prevent the kind of detailed scientific research into the properties and effects of cannabis that experts such as Barry would like to see.\\n\\nJudge Mueller held a five-day hearing on the topic of cannabis classification last year. She listened to final arguments on Wednesday.\\n\\nShe has said little to suggest which way she will rule, but at one hearing the judge did point out that there are âcontested issues of factâ regarding whether including cannabis in schedule one âpasses constitutional musterâ.\\n\\nThe federal government has taken a largely hands-off attitude to enforcing federal drug laws in states that allow marijuana for medical use.', 'caption': {'caption_node': 'Defense attorneys in the case argue that the federal governmentâs schedule one classification of marijuana is unlawful as the category indicates it has zero medical use.', 'alt_node': 'medical marijuana'}, 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1006\\\\5.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/31/measure-91-legal-marijuana-oregon-vote-ballot-state', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/31/1414756783420/898b067d-21e2-4c45-9c99-31a6a10a3e83-2060x1236.jpeg?width=445&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=1aae32bcc8071d159bbcc6e05e0a405c', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1006\\\\6.txt', 'title': 'Will Measure 91 make Oregon the most marijuana friendly state in the US? | Oregon | The Guardian', 'content': 'A campaign to legalise possession of up to eight ounces of cannabis and tax its sales has backing from a US senator and leading figures, but opponents warn its promises are overblown and dangers real\\n\\nThis time, say the backers of the latest vote to legalise marijuana in Oregon, things are different.\\n\\nTwo years ago, as neighbouring Washington state and Colorado became the first to authorise the sale of recreational cannabis to adults, Oregonians shot down a similar measure at the ballot box. Now they are being asked once again to approve the legalisation of marijuana but after a very different campaign.\\n\\nThe 2012 initiative was widely criticised as too open to abuse, and was clearly written by true believers â the proposed legislation made reference to George Washington growing cannabis and referred to âfederal and corporate misinformation campaignsâ that âsuppressesâ the truth about marijuana. The latest proposal, Measure 91, is written to have broader appeal, and it would provide for tighter regulation of the production and sale of marijuana.\\n\\nUnlike its predecessor, Measure 91 has heavyweight political backing. Oregon senator Jeff Merkley is the first US senator to come out publicly in support of legalisation. US representative Earl Blumenauer, whose district includes part of Portland, said he is backing the measure because âour marijuana laws donât work and exact a terrible cost in tax dollars, law enforcement priorities and peopleâs livesâ. They have been joined by a former Oregon state supreme court judge, ex-prosecutors, prominent newspapers and groups such as the Oregon Alliance for Retired Americans.\\n\\nPerhaps most significantly, there is big money behind the âYes on 91â initiative â big money that stayed away from the 2012 campaign. Supporters of legalisation have thrown millions of dollars into promoting it, with major funding from a group backed by the billionaire George Soros, while opponents have raised less than $200,000. As a result, the pro-legalisation advertising campaign drowns out the rival view.\\n\\nYet for all that, opinion polls have the outcome as too close to call. A survey for The Oregonian this week found 46% of voters opposed, 44% in favour, and 7% unsure.\\n\\nMeasure 91 would legalise marijuana use for anyone over 21, permit individuals to grow their own and possess up to eight ounces of cannabis, and bring in tax revenues to be distributed to schools, law enforcement and drug treatment programmes.\\n\\nAnthony Johnson, the chief sponsor of Measure 91, said that the drafters of the proposed law learned from the mistakes of the past.\\n\\nâThis time, itâs the rules and regulations put in place that have satisfied people looking to donate to the campaign as well as mainstream endorsers. Previous marijuana measures would have legalised an unlimited amount of marijuana for people to grow and possess at home, for instance, whereas Measure 91 very much regulates marijuana like beer and wine. Those rules and regulations make moderate voters and mainstream endorsers more comfortable with this measure than other measures in the past,â he said.\\n\\nThe âYes on 91â campaign is drawing heavily on the experience in Washington and Colorado to back its case.\\n\\nâPeople have seen that the sky hasnât fallen in either state,â said Johnson. âThe barometers that most people would look at as to whether marijuana legalisation has been a success or a failure â safety on the highways, usage by minors and the crime rate, as well as new revenue coming into the state â they can see regulating, legalising and taxing marijuana can be a successful policy.â\\n\\nBut Measure 91âs opponents are finding grist for their cause in Washington state and Colorado too. They accuse supporters of legalisation of glossing over important differences between the proposed Oregon law and those already in force. Measure 91 would allow residents to grow their own cannabis and supply it to friends, provided they do not charge, while Washington permits only licensed production. Colorado and Washington both limit possession to one ounce. Measure 91 would allow eight times that amount. Critics say that will cost the state a good portion of the promised tax revenues and encourage smuggling to other states.\\n\\nAnd opponents say that the promise of tax revenues is already overblown. Oregonâs Legislative Revenue Office estimates that legalised sales of marijuana would bring in about $16m in 2017 and rise after that. Oregonâs revenues from the lottery were more than $1bn last year.\\n\\nMandi Puckett, director of the group leading opposition, âNo on 91â, says the money poured into the âYesâ campaign â which includes tens of thousands of dollars in donations from firms in Washington, Colorado and California making money from marijuana â is evidence that the push for legalisation is being driven by profit.\\n\\nâThis is about commercialisation and big industry, just like alcohol and tobacco, coming into our state to market addictive products and be able to make money off of Oregonians. Taxpayers here are going to pay huge social costs for treatment and for traffic fatalities and overheads to regulate this,â she said.\\n\\nPuckett quoted from a federal government report on legalisation in Colorado released in August which shows that since the legalisation of medical marijuana in Colorado in 2006 fatal in car accidents involving the drug have doubled, and that there has been a 400% increase in the smuggling of marijuana from Colorado over the past five years. The state also has a significantly higher proportion of underaged use of marijuana compared to the national average.\\n\\nFor Puckett perhaps the most worrisome issue to have emerged from Colorado is what she describes as the ânormalising of marijuanaâ and its impact on young people. The widespread sale of marijuana-infused products in Colorado, such as sweets, sodas and cakes, has drawn attention in Oregon.\\n\\nâWhat it means is mass commercialisation; stores being able to open to communities selling products like marijuana gummy bears and soda pop and ice cream and cookies and candy, and those products overwhelmingly appeal to kids. Those are huge huge concerns,â said Puckett.\\n\\nâItâs about acceptance, social norms and advertising and promoting a product. That is going to send a message to our youth that itâs not harmful, itâs not addictive and when you increase access to a drug through legalisation weâre going to see its use go up. The normalisation of this drug is really disturbing when it comes to our youth.â\\n\\nOpponents of Measure 91 received some unexpected backing for their concerns from the chief consultant to Washington state on its marijuana laws, UCLA professor Mark Kleiman, who warned about the relatively low tax in the proposed Oregon law.\\n\\nâUnless the legislature decided to raise it, the $35-per-ounce tax in Measure 91 would lead, within a couple of years, to prices way below current illicit prices and way below legal prices in Washington state,â Kleiman warned in a blog post.\\n\\nâThat in turn would mean big increases in use by minors and in the number of Oregonians with diagnosable cannabis problems. It would also mean substantial diversion of cannabis products legally sold under Oregonâs low taxes to Washington, where taxes are much higherâ.\\n\\nKleiman also said the idea that barring minors from buying cannabis in stores will keep them from having access to it âdoesnât pass the giggle testâ.\\n\\nâCheap cannabis for grown-ups inevitably means cheap cannabis for kids,â he said.\\n\\nThe âYes on 91â campaign is aware that fears about young people being drawn to the drug is one of the most significant concerns it has to overcome. Part of the strengthening of the latest ballot proposal over the 2012 initiative involved stronger measures to prevent people under 21 buying cannabis.\\n\\nJohnson said that legalising marijuana also removes some of the dangers for young users.\\n\\nâBy lumping marijuana in with heroin and cocaine and meth, that breeds a lot of distrust with kids,â he said. âIf kids are going to seek out marijuana, where are they going to seek it out today? Itâs people who are breaking the law and could also be selling heroin and meth and more harmful drugs.â\\n\\nUltimately, Johnson paints Measure 91 as a social justice issue.\\n\\nâWe are arresting and citing over 10,000 people every year. If you are African American you are 100% more likely to be arrested for marijuana even though usage amongst races isnât any different,â he said.\\n\\nâAnd if you are poor, the consequences of the marijuana offence are much greater than if youâre not. It feeds into racial justice as well as income inequality. If youâre rich a $650 fine doesnât mean anything to you, but if youâre on a fixed income of $800 a month, it means a lot to you.â\\n\\nSome leading Oregonians who previously opposed legalisation now see it as inevitable. A former state supreme court justice, William Riggs, voted against the measure two years ago but is publicly backing it this time.\\n\\nâMarijuana legalization is inevitable. I believe we need to do it with the most responsible approach possible,â he said in a statement of support.\\n\\nRiggs said that âtreating marijuana use as a crime has failedâ, that it has strengthened violent drug cartels in Mexico which sell marijuana in Oregon and that enforcing marijuana prohibition âhas bogged down our justice systemâ.\\n\\nâLast year, 13,408 people were arrested or cited for marijuana crimes in Oregon. Thatâs one person every 39 minutes, all of whom go through the justice system,â he said.\\n\\nThat view has been challenged by the Oregon Sheriffsâ Association, which opposes legalisation. Law enforcement officials say almost no one is arrested over small amounts of marijuana these days because in 1973 Oregon became the first state to decriminalise possession of less than one ounce. The vast majority of people receive tickets with fines and are not arrested. Only about 130 people are in Oregon prisons for marijuana-related crimes.\\n\\nâItâs not clogging our jails,â said Clatsop County sheriff Tom Bergin. âItâs not stopping us from solving other crimes because itâs not a crime if they have an ounce or their medical marijuana card. Itâs completely bogus.â\\n\\nJohnson said that his campaign has heard from district attorneys and police officers across Oregon who favour the change but feel unable to speak publicly on the issue. But for all the arguments, he said the outcome of the ballot on Measure 91 may ultimately hinge on turnout.\\n\\nâOpinion polls show a significant divide between generations over the legalisation of marijuana, so the more younger voters the campaign can turn out the better its chances,â he said.', 'caption': {'caption_node': 'A sheriffs association argues that already lax laws undermine the claims of legal marijuana advocates.', 'alt_node': 'Medicine Man Denver is the single largest legal medical and recreational marijuana dispensary in Denver, Colorado .'}, 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1006\\\\6.jpg'}], 'matched_no_text': [{'page_link': 'https://bijouxtocara.info/photo-gallery/forskel-p%C3%A5-hash-og-skunk', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/3/1425418056702/5bf674db-5f54-423f-8557-1524280c698a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=445&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=045944d06e87d4d71428f8a35e3a52e9', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1006\\\\no_text_0.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://knapwell.info/photos/skunk-og-hash-forskel', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/3/1425418056702/5bf674db-5f54-423f-8557-1524280c698a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=445&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=045944d06e87d4d71428f8a35e3a52e9', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1006\\\\no_text_1.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://prepona.info/image-collection/forskel-p%C3%A5-hash-og-skunk', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/3/1425418056702/5bf674db-5f54-423f-8557-1524280c698a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=445&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=045944d06e87d4d71428f8a35e3a52e9', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1006\\\\4.txt', 'title': 'Loading...', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1006\\\\4.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/12/legal-marijuana-edibles-policy-studies', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/13/1423857518035/d6805a83-d320-415d-8fee-aec0c9157392-2060x1236.jpeg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d90bac12b0b25641499cfecfb2e4f4b9', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1006\\\\0.txt', 'title': 'Half-baked marijuana edibles policies pose public health risk, studies say | US news | The Guardian', 'content': 'Children are attracted to candy packaging and labels are misleading for some adults as authors say courts may be one remedy for consumers hurt by products\\n\\nTwo new articles in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) attempt to explain the complex legal and public health implications of legalized marijuana âediblesâ, given the lack of reliable data and patchwork regulation of the drug in the US.\\n\\nThe articles were published on Wednesday, a day after three high-profile US senators introduced legislation to legalize medical marijuana across the country. The move by Republican Rand Paul, of Kentucky, and Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, and Cory Booker, of New Jersey, was greeted by some activists as merely symbolic.\\n\\nâMany jurisdictions have legalized marijuana either for recreational or medicinal use,â said Dr Jeffrey Drazen, editor of the NEJM, in a statement emailed to the Guardian. âHealth professionals should be aware of the effects of marijuana and its status as a drug.â\\n\\nMarijuana for recreational use is sold in Colorado and Washington state, and was recently legalized in Alaska and Oregon. The authors of one of the NEJM articles see legalization as likely in at least seven more states, from Arizona to Vermont.\\n\\nâWe very much wanted to alert public health officials,â said Robert MacCoun, co-author of one of the papers, Half-Baked â the Retail Promotion of Marijuana Edibles, and a professor at Stanford Law School. âI mean, our essay is not a moral essay.â\\n\\nThe two articles pay particular attention to the âediblesâ market â food products infused with marijuanaâs psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC â highlighting that such products can be especially dangerous to children.\\n\\nThe two papers point out that children seem to be attracted to the packaging of edibles, which are often sold as sweets and named with weed-related puns on existing candies, cookies or chocolate.\\n\\nSome characteristics of edibles can be problematic for adults as well, the authors say, as doses in marijuana-infused foods can vary widely, serving sizes are not necessarily well-sectioned and individual metabolisms can affect resultant highs. Famously, in an essay for the New York Times, the columnist Maureen Dowd described the effects of sampling an âedibleâ candy bar she later discovered was âsupposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novicesâ, but which had not had such information on the label.\\n\\nâThe caramel-chocolate flavored candy bar looked so innocent,â Dowd wrote, âlike the Sky Bars I used to love as a child.â\\n\\nAfter marijuana was legalized in Colorado in January 2014, a Denver hospital saw a dramatic increase in the number of children between ages three and seven being treated after accidentally eating marijuana, the Denver Post reported. Between 2005 and 2013, eight children were treated for accidental ingestion; nine were treated in the first five months of 2014.\\n\\nFurthermore, the poison control hotlines of states with legalized medical marijuana are now more likely to receive calls about children younger than age nine unintentionally consuming marijuana.\\n\\nColorado and Washington do regulate edibles: the serving size must be indicated on labels, packaging cannot target children, and a label warns parents to âkeep out of the reach of childrenâ. But MacCoun and co-author Michelle Mello, a Harvard professor of law and public health, make further recommendations. Packaging of marijuana edibles should be clearly distinguishable from food, they say, and states should restrict the extent to which edibles can resemble well-known sweets, include clear dosing information and warnings about over-consumption on labels.\\n\\nâ[Our article] is just an argument about, âHey, there are some pretty common sense things that could be done to protect kids from bad outcomes,â MacCoun said. âThere are steps that could be taken that wouldnât really infringe upon the freedoms of adults who want to use marijuana edibles, but having brightly colored candies and soda pops is a recipe for problems.â\\n\\nFederal agencies such as the Justice Department and the Food and Drug Administration have so far taken a hands-off approach to the edibles market, leaving states to define regulatory methods.\\n\\nThe authors of the second NEJM paper, Medical Marijuanaâs Public Health lessons â Implications for Retail Marijuana in Colorado, say public health outcomes are just beginning to come to light.\\n\\nData from hospitals and surveys is trickling in in states such as Colorado, for example, despite the federal governmentâs complete control over marijuana research. There is a near-total lockdown on marijuana research, because of its Schedule I classification by the Drug Enforcement Administration, a category which defines the drug as having no recognized medical value and puts it in the same class as heroin.\\n\\nFederal refusal to recognize the medical value of marijuana also stops research dollars from reaching institutions which might normally rely on federal grants. The Carers Act, the marijuana bill introduced to the Senate, seeks to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug.\\n\\nMacCoun and Mello concluded that the courts may be the best remedy for any consumers who have recently been hurt by edibles.\\n\\nâBecause legal channels are available to address the problems with marijuana edibles, such issues are not an argument against legalizing marijuana,â they wrote. âIndeed, one potential advantage of legalization is that is provides more regulatory levers than are available under prohibition.\\n\\nâAs legalization of marijuana spreads, new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked.â', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1006\\\\0.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/kofi-annan-on-why-drug-bans-are-ineffective-a-1078402.html', 'image_link': 'https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/669ea8c8-0001-0004-0000-000000860671_w180_r1.33_fpx35.68_fpy50.jpg', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1006\\\\8.txt', 'title': 'Kofi Annan On Why Drug Bans Are Ineffective - DER SPIEGEL', 'content': 'In my experience, good public policy is best shaped by the dispassionate analysis of what in practice has worked, or not. Policy based on common assumptions and popular sentiments can become a recipe for mistaken prescriptions and misguided interventions.\\n\\nNowhere is this divorce between rhetoric and reality more evident than in the formulation of global drug policies, where too often emotions and ideology rather than evidence have prevailed.\\n\\nTake the case of the medical use of cannabis. By looking carefully at the evidence from the United States, we now know that legalizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes has not, as opponents argued, led to an increase in its use by teenagers. By contrast, there has been a near tripling of American deaths from heroin overdoses between 2010 and 2013, even though the law and its severe punishments remain unchanged.\\n\\nThis year, between April 19 and 21, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on drugs and the world will have a chance to change course. As we approach that event, we need to ask ourselves if we are on the right policy path. More specifically, how do we deal with what the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has called the \"unintended consequences\" of the policies of the last 50 years, which have helped, among other things, to create a vast, international criminal market in drugs that fuels violence, corruption and instability? Just think of the 16,000 murders in Mexico in 2013, many of which are directly linked to drug trafficking.\\n\\nA War on People\\n\\nGlobally, the \"war on drugs\" has not succeeded. Some estimate that enforcing global prohibition costs at least $100 billion (â¬90.7 billion) a year, but as many as 300 million people now use drugs worldwide, contributing to a global illicit market with a turnover of $330 billion a year, one of the largest commodity markets in the world.\\n\\nProhibition has had little impact on the supply of or demand for drugs. When law enforcement succeeds in one area, drug production simply moves to another region or country, drug trafficking moves to another route and drug users switch to a different drug. Nor has prohibition significantly reduced use. Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country\\'s drug laws and its levels of drug use. The widespread criminalization and punishment of people who use drugs, the over-crowded prisons, mean that the war on drugs is, to a significant degree, a war on drug users -- a war on people.\\n\\nAfrica is sadly an example of these problems. The West Africa Commission on Drugs, which my foundation convened, reported last year that the region has now become not only a major transit point between producers in Latin America and consumers in Europe, but an area where consumption is increasing. Drug money, and the criminality associated with it, is fostering corruption and violence. The stability of countries and the region as a whole is under threat.\\n\\nI believe that drugs have destroyed many lives, but wrong government policies have destroyed many more. We all want to protect our families from the potential harm of drugs. But if our children do develop a drug problem, surely we will want them cared for as patients in need of treatment and not branded as criminals.\\n\\nStop Stigmatizing and Start Helping\\n\\nThe tendency in many parts of the world to stigmatize and incarcerate drug users has prevented many from seeking medical treatment. In what other areas of public health do we criminalize patients in need of help? Punitive measures have sent many people to prison, where their drug use has worsened. A criminal record for a young person for a minor drug offence can be a far greater threat to their well-being than occasional drug use.\\n\\nThe original intent of drug policy, according to the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs, was to protect the \"health and welfare of mankind.\" We need to refocus international and national policy on this key objective.\\n\\nThis requires us to take four critical steps.\\n\\nFirst, we must decriminalize personal drug use. The use of drugs is harmful and reducing those harms is a task for the public health system, not the courts. This must be coupled with the strengthening of treatment services, especially in middle and low-income countries.\\n\\nSecond, we need to accept that a drug-free world is an illusion. We must focus instead on ensuring that drugs cause the least possible harm. Harm reduction measures, such as needle exchange programs, can make a real difference. Germany adopted such measures early on and the level of HIV infections among injecting drug users is close to 5 percent, compared to over 40 percent in some countries which resist this pragmatic approach.\\n\\nThird, we have to look at regulation and public education rather than the total suppression of drugs, which we know will not work. The steps taken successfully to reduce tobacco consumption (a very powerful and damaging addiction) show what can be achieved. It is regulation and education, not the threat of prison, which has cut the number of smokers in many countries. Higher taxes, restrictions on sale and effective anti-smoking campaigns have delivered the right results.\\n\\nThe legal sale of cannabis is a reality that started with California legalizing the sale of cannabis for medical use in 1996. Since then, 22 US states and some European countries have followed suit. Others have gone further still. A voter initiative which gained a majority at the ballot box has caused Colorado to legalize the sale of cannabis for recreational use. Last year, Colorado collected around $135 million in taxes and license fees related to legal cannabis sales. Others have taken less commercial routes. Users of Spain\\'s cannabis social clubs can grow and buy cannabis through small non-commercial organizations. And Canada looks likely to become the first G7 country to regulate the sale of cannabis next year.\\n\\nLegal Regulation Protects Health\\n\\nInitial trends show us that where cannabis has been legalized, there has been no explosion in drug use or drug-related crime. The size of the black market has been reduced and thousands of young people have been spared criminal records. But a regulated market is not a free market. We need to carefully think through what needs regulating, and what does not. While most cannabis use is occasional, moderate and not associated with significant problems, it is nonetheless precisely because of its potential risks that it needs to be regulated.\\n\\nAnd therefore, the fourth and final step is to recognize that drugs must be regulated precisely because they are risky. It is time to acknowledge that drugs are infinitely more dangerous if they are left solely in the hands of criminals who have no concerns about health and safety. Legal regulation protects health. Consumers need to be aware of what they are taking and have clear information on health risks and how to minimize them. Governments need to be able to regulate vendors and outlets according to how much harm a drug can cause. The most risky drugs should never be available \"over the counter\" but only via medical prescription for people registered as dependent users, as is already happening in Switzerland.\\n\\nScientific evidence and our concern for health and human rights must shape drug policy.

So it now expects full year profits to be below last yearâs figure of Â£49.6m.\\n\\nIt said the London market was expected to be constrained for some time because of political and economic concerns in the UK and Europe, tighter mortgage lending markets and a mismatch between price expectations of buyers and sellers.\\n\\nEarlier this year the Bank of England imposed limits on how much people could borrow to buy a house, in a bid to tackle increasing debt levels and rising house prices.\\n\\nFoxtons chief executive Nic Budden said:\\n\\nDespite the impact that market uncertainty is having on transaction volumes, we are continuing with our clear strategy, centralised business model and steady roll out programme which is delivering higher market share.\\n\\nFoxtons, which warned in August that sales growth was slowing due to tougher lending conditions and worries about rising interest rates, has seen its shares fall 31.7p to 173.6p, its worst day since it listed last September at 230p.\\n\\nThe news hit rivals Countrywide, down 20.1p at 462.5p, and Savills, 22p lower at 611.5p. Online property group Zoopla has dropped 6.8p to 207.2p and London-focused housebuilder Berkeley Group is down 63p at Â£22.37.\\n\\nBack with Foxtons, and analyst Robin Savage at Canaccord Genuity slashed his price target by 40% from 382p to 228p and moved from buy to hold.\\n\\nIn line with the guidance in todayâs statement we have reduced our EBITDA forecast for 2014 to Â£47.1m, which is below 2013. Our 2015 forecast is 10% higher than 2014, reflecting the growth of the branch network.\\n\\nLiberum said:\\n\\nManagement is still confident in the longer term outlook for London but say that political uncertainty will continue for a while, and the market will need to digest tighter mortgage lending and mismatches in expectations between buyers and sellers (is this as close as agents get to saying that inflation is running out of steam).\\n\\nNumis analyst Chris Millington said:\\n\\nWe are reducing 2014 and 2015 EBITDA by 16% and 19% respectively. The downgrades are significant and reflect the sharp slowdown in London transactions in recent months against a very strong comparative. We continue to believe in the fundamentals of the business and still forecast 10% EBITDA growth in 2015 under the assumption of flat market conditions.\\n\\nWhilst it is clearly disappointing to reduce estimates, the slowdown in Central London has been particularly sharp (with transaction volumes declining from around 82% of normal market volumes in the second half of 2013 to around 60-65% at present) and it is uncertain as to when the market recovers and price expectations move to a clearing level (it could be post election?). We continue to believe in the fundamentals of the Foxtons model (strong cash generation and self financed organic growth) and the reduction in 2014 forecasts actually takes us back close to our original IPO EBITDA forecast (Â£48.8m) under a similar set of market assumptions.', 'caption': {'caption_node': 'The Foxtons X-ray Mini.

The estate agent floated on the stockmarket last September.\\n\\nIn its statement, Foxtons said: âAlthough the longer-term outlook for London property markets remains positive, the market is expected to continue to be constrained for some time due to political and economic uncertainty within the UK and Europe, tighter mortgage lending markets, and mismatches between the price expectations of buyers and sellers.â\\n\\nFoxtons said that buyers had grown wary after prices in London rose almost 20% in the last year and were taking on board expectations that interest rates would start to rise next year. Mortgages are in short supply after the Bank of England imposed restrictions on lenders in an effort to cool the property market.\\n\\nLabourâs adoption of a tax on properties worth more than Â£2m has also increased concerns about political intervention in the property market after next Mayâs general election. Estate agents reckon at least 80% of homes that would be subject to the tax are in London and the south-east.\\n\\nFoxtons warned in August that the London property market was slowing down but the rate of decline took City analysts by surprise. Foxtons said the slowdown had increased since August and sales for the second half would be âsignificantlyâ lower than the same period last year.\\n\\nBefore Foxtonsâs warning, analysts had expected annual earnings of Â£57m. They now predict a figure around Â£48m.\\n\\nFoxtonsâ initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013 was oversubscribed as investors sought to tap the London property market via the chain, which is infamous for its brash sales tactics and fleet of liveried Mini Coopers. The shares floated at 230p and hit a high of 399p in February but have hovered below their float price for the past month.

The massive gathering was photographed as part of an annual survey undertaken by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\\n\\n35,000 walrus gather on the shoreline near Point Lay, Alaska. Pacific walrus looking for places to rest in the absence of sea ice are coming ashore in record numbers on Alaskaâs north-west coast\\n\\nThis aerial photo taken on 23 September 2014, shows a gathering 1,500 on Alaskaâs north-west coast\\n\\nAndrea Medeiros, a spokeswoman for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, told the Associated Press wire agency that the animals\\' mass movement was first detected on 13 September, and that they have been moving on and off shore ever since.\\n\\nObservers have reported seeing carcasses, which may be from dead animals killed in a stampede. The biggest of these tusked beasts can weigh in excess of two tonnes. Scientists were heading to the area to perform necropsies to determine the exact cause of death, Andrea Medeiros added.\\n\\nAn injured walrus at Point Lay\\n\\nWalruses are an ice-dependent species. They rely on it for everything from giving birth to diving down to reach the food below. But with sea ice having retreated far offshore, the Walruses have been forced to swim to land to be able to forage and rest.\\n\\nPacific walruses in the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska in June 2014. Researchers are trying to improve their knowledge of the animalâs numbers ahead of an expected US Fish and Wildlife Service decision on whether they need special protection\\n\\nWalruses, each of which can weigh more than 4,000 pounds, depend on sea ice for hunting food in deeper ocean waters and resting in between those dives, and the retreat of sea ice cover in recent years has helped push them ashore in increasing numbers in the Russian Arctic and now the Alaskan Arctic as well, biologists and climate scientists said.\\n\\nWalrus haul outs in the U.S. have occurred in six of the last eight years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. However, previous events were in far smaller numbers than the current event, on the order of a few thousand to about 10,000 marine mammals, according to Margaret Williams, who directs the World Wildlife Fundâs Arctic program. A study published last year found the 2011 haul out may have been as large as 30,000 animals.\\n\\nAn underwater view of Walrus off Svalbard, Norway\\n\\nWhile it\\'s hardly the first big Walrus gathering to be documented, a fact well noted by climate change skeptics, scientists say the size of the gatherings are growing as climate change melts Arctic sea ice, depriving Walruses of their sunning platforms of choice\\n\\nThis is what #climatechange looks like. 35,000 walruses forced ashore: http://t.co/Nt2JfmrR4B pic.twitter.com/dNV3sIzRvV\\n\\n\"The walruses are hauling out on land in a spectacle that has become all too common in six of the last eight years as a consequence of climate-induced warming,\" the U.S. Geological Survey wrote on their website Wednesday.\\n\\n\"Summer sea ice is retreating far north of the shallow continental shelf waters of the Chukchi Sea in U.S. and Russian waters, a condition that did not occur a decade ago,\" the USGS website says. \"To keep up with their normal resting periods between feeding bouts to the seafloor, walruses have simply hauled out onto shore.\"\\n\\nWithin hours of newspapers covering the striking photographs, the walrus and their reason for being on that forlorn shore became enmeshed in the politics of climate change. âThis is what climate change looks like,â said WWF. Climate sceptics immediately produced evidence that showed the haul out was nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\nBoth sides were guilty of simplification. But it is almost certain climate change forced the walrus ashore at Point Lay and it places the speciesâ future in jeopardy. The walrus, almost all of them females and calves, should be spending their summer on the fringes of the Arctic sea ice. But the ice is gone.\\n\\nWalrus swim in a tight group to protect their pups in Foxe Basin, Canada\\n\\nAs the ocean heats up due to global warming, Arctic sea ice has been locked in a downward spiral, according to  NatGeo\\n\\nWalrus herds rest on sea ice during the spring breakup in the Chukchi Sea\\n\\nSince the late 1970s, the ice has retreated by 12 percent per decade, worsening after 2007, according to NASA. Walruses were first spotted coming ashore in large numbers in 2007. In 2009, an estimated 3,000 walruses were seen; the number rose to 30,000 in 2011 and went back down to 10,000 in 2013.\\n\\nScientists have seen large haul-outs on the Russian side of the Bering Strait for quite some time, says Anthony Fischbach, a wildlife biologist at the USGS in Anchorage. But since the first recordings of walrus gatherings in Alaska in the 1870s, groups of this size weren\\'t observed until 2007, he said. May 2014 represented the third lowest extent of sea ice during that month in the satellite record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\\n\\nLori Polasek, a marine biologist at the Alaska SeaLife Center, a research and wildlife rehabilitation facility in Seward, says:\\n\\n\"Being in Alaska, climate change is very apparent. That\\'s the reason why we have lost summer Arctic ice.\"\\n\\nWhile it\\'s not unusual for male Walruses to gather in large numbers on Alaska\\'s shores, females typically prefer floating ice chunks as places to give birth, leaving calves on the ice when finding food\\n\\nFemale walruses and their young rest on sea ice between foraging bouts in July 2012\\n\\nWalrus gatherings are also a natural occurrence, Polasek said. Walruses pull their bodies out of the waterâor \"haul out\"âto rest or warm up on ice platforms or land. Hauling out is partially convenience and partially walrus nature, said Polasek. The stretch of beach near Point Lay is close to Hanna Shoal reef, a prey-rich foraging ground.\\n\\nThe giant marine mammals are gregarious and tactile animals, swimming side by side in the water and sprawling all over each other on shore. And when it\\'s time to haul out, walruses tend to play follow the leader\\n\\n\"Until one brave soul is willing to haul, they\\'re all looking around and wondering, \\'Hey, did Bertha just haul out?\\' Wherever Bertha or that brave soul picks, within hours, they\\'ll all begin to haul out to [that place],\" Polasek said. \"They just want to be with other walruses.\" Polasek predicts the herd will remain at Point Lay for two to four weeks. They\\'ll return to the waters once winter ice begins to form.\\n\\nWalrus in the Chukchi Sea, 2010\\n\\nHowever, haul-outs can be harmful to Walrus populations. For one, calves are particularly at risk of disease and from stampedes. Upon a disturbance, whether that\\'s a polar bear or a boat in the distance, walruses tend to rush to the water.\\n\\nFemale and young walruses rest on the shore near Point Lay in September 2013, after sea ice disappeared from their offshore foraging grounds in the eastern Chukchi Sea\\n\\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which tracks the status of species worldwide, says there\\'s not enough information about walrus population trends to say whether the speciesâwhich has three subspecies, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Laptev walrusâis in decline. However, \"climate change is expected to have negative consequences for Walruses, and particularly severe consequences for the Pacific subspecies,\" according to the IUCN website.\\n\\nThe skull of a sub-adult Pacific walrus lies on the rocky tundra near the shore of Wrangel Island in Russia, 2009\\n\\nIn 2009, about a tenth of the walruses that hauled out died. This year, at least 36 walrus carcasses have been spotted, according to NOAA. That track record does not bode well for the species. \"This shift to land of calf loss is large and population recovery is slow. If the ice continues to wane, they\\'ll continue to come on land and you potentially have more stampedes. Then it\\'ll be a pickle where [the population] can\\'t recover,\" said Polasek.\\n\\nPolasek added it\\'s unlikely that the marine mammals can adapt to hauling out in large droves. Though there may be no way to prevent disturbances like polar bears and other predators, human communities can learn to adapt to the animal\\'s growing presence on land, she said. \"The village of Point Lay ... has laid out extremely concerted efforts to protect the herd,\" Polasek said. \"They don\\'t hunt in the herd. They direct vessel traffic away from the herd. They do everything they can to prevent human disturbances.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ll send a list to your inbox, once a day.

The law makes change.\\n\\nCoalition challenges U.S. Fish and Wildlife rule allowing oil industry to harm mammals in the Chukchi Sea\\n\\nGwen Dobbs, Alaska Wilderness League, (202) 329-9295\\n\\nRebecca Noblin, Center for Biological Diversity, (907) 274-1110\\n\\nJeff Benzak, Natural Resources Defense Council, (202) 513-6248\\n\\nA coalition of conservation organizations filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today, challenging a rule that permits oil companies, like Shell Oil, to harm Pacific walruses during Arctic Ocean oil drilling beginning as early as next year in key walrus feeding areas.\\n\\nApproximately 35,000 walruses gather on the northwest coast of Alaska, near Point Lay, on Sept. 27, 2014.\\n\\nThe Arctic Oceanâs sea ice is rapidly melting due to climate change, creating dire consequences for Chukchi Sea walruses which depend on the ice for resting, raising their young, feeding, and avoiding predators. As a result of this melting, the walruses have been forced ashore in recent years. This year it happened again as 35,000 walruses crowded together on the Alaskan Arctic coast just a few weeks ago. Walruses must swim distances up to 100 miles from these coastal haulout areas to reach Chukchi feeding grounds to find the clams and other bottom species they need to survive. They are vulnerable to stampedes and trampling when forced to use coastal resting areas.\\n\\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife rule puts these already at risk mammals directly in harmâs way by allowing risky oil company operations in key walrus foraging areas in the Chukchi Sea. This rule is being challenged by Earthjustice on behalf of Alaska Wilderness League, Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace, Resisting Environmental Destruction on Indigenous Lands, Sierra Club and by the Natural Resources Defense Council.\\n\\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service adopted this regulation, which allows for âthe incidental take of walruses in connection with oil and gas activities,â even though the agency acknowledged that walruses could be affected adversely in large numbers in crucial habitat areas like the Hanna Shoal. Shell Oil intends to drill under this government rule as early as 2015. The company was investigated and fined after multiple missteps and close calls during its efforts to drill in the Arctic Ocean in 2012, only to call its work in the region a success.\\n\\nOil operations have the potential to chase walruses away from food-rich foraging areas, trigger stampedes, and harm the animals with deafeningly loud seismic blasts. Drilling risks catastrophic oil spills that could not be cleaned up in Arctic conditions.\\n\\nThe September minimum sea-ice extent reached a new record low in 2012, encompassing only about half the area it covered on average from 1981â2010. In 2014, the sea ice shrank to 5.02 million square kilometers (1.94 million square miles), the sixth-lowest extent of the satellite record.\\n\\nâThe Fish and Wildlife Service needs to do a much better job of protecting walrus mothers and calves struggling to survive in the dramatically changing Chukchi Sea,â said Earthjustice Attorney Erik Grafe. âTodayâs challenge seeks to protect walruses from suffering potential serious harm and harassment at the hands of companies like Shell Oil, which crashed and burned during its Arctic Ocean drilling efforts in 2012. Walruses are already under tremendous stress from climate changeâtheir sea ice home is literally melting away. Without adequate analysis, the challenged rules would add to walrusesâ woes by allowing drilling and risking oil spills in the areas most important for food and resting. Whatâs more, drilling would accelerate the climate change already causing so much trouble for walruses.â\\n\\nâWalruses are the Arcticâs canary in a coal mine,â said Cindy Shogan, executive director for Alaska Wilderness League. âWe canât ignore the signs and impacts of climate change in the Arctic. The Interior Department must better protect walruses and the fragile Arctic Ocean with its disappearing shoreline from harm by big oil companies, like Shell. Adding drilling into this already dangerous mix is reckless and irresponsible.â\\n\\nâThe last thing Arctic walruses need is dirty drilling in the middle of their most important habitat. Itâs time for oil companies to stop sticking their drills where they donât belong, and itâs up to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to lay down the law,â said Rebecca Noblin of the Center for Biological Diversity.\\n\\nâShell is putting the Arctic walrus in double jeopardy. Their world is melting because of oil companiesâ greedy thirst for more fossil fuels, and now their home will could be under imminent threat from a Shell spill. The Obama administration needs to put sane regulations in place that protect this sensitive species,â said Greenpeace Arctic Campaign Specialist John Deans.\\n\\nâThe Fish and Wildlife Service wants to decide first, think later,â said Michael Jasny, director of Marine Mammal Protection at the Natural Resources Defense Council. âBefore it has all the facts, the agency is casting its lot with a few big oil corporationsâinstead of the tens of thousands of mother walruses who must swim massive distances before hauling up to rest and feed their young.â\\n\\nâWalruses already are under great stress from climate change. This rule would allow oil drillers to risk further harm to the species without proper analysis and mitigation. The risks are too greatâif drilling resulted in an oil spill, there would be no way to clean or contain it, and the consequences could be catastrophic,â said Robert Thompson of REDOIL.\\n\\nâThe danger to walrus is one more in a long list of serious risks posed by drilling in the Arctic Ocean,â said Dan Ritzman, Alaska program director for the Sierra Clubâs Our Wild America campaign. âWe should not sacrifice the Arcticâs amazing wildlife, the subsistence culture that depends on it, or our climate to dirty drilling. The effects on walrus and other wildlife will only worsen if we donât begin keeping dirty fuels in the ground.â\\n\\nEarthjustice is the premier nonprofit environmental law organization.

We did the very best we could at the time with the knowledge we had.â\\n\\nShe added: âEvery time it comes around to the anniversary I cringe, because I know people will bring up my name, they blame me, they say that I lied and that people died because I lied, [they say] people have died because I made a mistake.â\\n\\nA week after two hijacked passenger jets were flown into the towers of the World Trade Center, killing 2,753 people â 184 died in the Pentagon in Washington DC and 40 were killed when a United Airlines plane came down in a field in Pennsylvania â Whitman issued a statement. It said: âI am glad to reassure the people of New York â¦ that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink.â\\n\\nShe has always maintained that as head of the EPA she was simply passing on what government scientists were telling her, warning those working at Ground Zero itself to wear respirators but dismissing concerns over the surrounding area, which was engulfed in dust and ash.\\n\\nThree days after the attacks, Whitman, who had previously been the Republican governor of New Jersey, told reporters: âThe good news continues to be that air samples we have taken have all been at levels that cause us no concern.â\\n\\nIn 2003, the EPA inspector general criticized the agencyâs handling of the crisis, finding that the EPA had no basis for its swift pronouncements about air quality. Politicians, including the then New York senator Hillary Clinton, laid into the Bush administration, accusing it of deceiving the public.\\n\\nMore than 37,000 people registered with the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP), a federal organisation set up in 2011 to oversee those affected by exposure to the toxins released at Ground Zero, have been declared sick. Many have chronic respiratory illnesses or cancer.\\n\\nMore than 1,100 people covered by the WTCHP have died. That number includes first responders who were at Ground Zero and people who lived and worked in the surrounding area.\\n\\nA WTCHP spokeswoman, Christy Spring, said: âWe have a list of health conditions that the program provides medical monitoring and treatment for, established by the government to have been related to exposure to the dust and debris from the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.â\\n\\nWhitman said: âIf people are dying from this â and I have not seen the data â and they had believed everything was fine, then you have got to blame the message they were hearing, and what they were hearing was that the ambient air quality in Lower Manhattan at the time was OK.â\\n\\nJerrold Nadler, a veteran US congressman whose district covers the World Trade Center site, told the Guardian on Thursday that Whitman had never admitted she had been wrong about the air quality.\\n\\nâShe knew or should have knownâ the air was dangerous, he said.\\n\\nIn 2008, Nadler accused Whitman of causing thousands to suffer injury âand in some cases deathâ due to âunnecessary exposure to toxins released by the collapse of the World Trade Center buildingsâ.\\n\\nIn a ruling in a lawsuit brought by New York residents that year, a federal appeals court ruled that Whitman could not be held liable for health problems caused by the air around Ground Zero.\\n\\nOn Friday, Whitman questioned the level of proof that the air made people sick, but said: âIf this is a direct relation, we all screwed up.â She thought she was right at the time, she said, but added: âI can believe that the scientists may not have had all the information they needed.â\\n\\nShortly after the attack on New York, Whitman said it was known that asbestos, lead and other toxins were in the wreckage of the Twin Towers, known as âthe pileâ, and that those working on rescue and recovery there should wear respirators. Most did not.\\n\\nAs the city under Mayor Rudy Giuliani led the work at Ground Zero rather than the federal government, Whitman said, she had had no authority to enforce the recommended wearing of safety equipment.\\n\\nAt the time, she said that beyond the pile, in the surrounding neighborhoods and the rest of Manhattan, the air did ânot pose a public health hazardâ.', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1017\\\\2.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/ground-zero-park51-new-york', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/18/1282152343356/Site-Of-Proposed-Ground-Z-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa76da4012ee9d133fd81319221beba5', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1017\\\\1.txt', 'title': \"Why Park51 is much more than the 'mosque at Ground Zero' | Ground Zero | The Guardian\", 'content': 'It\\'s easier to say what the \"mosque at Ground Zero\" is not, than what it is. It\\'s not a mosque, and it\\'s not at Ground Zero â only nearby. It\\'s not a \"clubhouse for terrorists\", as some objectors have called it, nor a work of \"triumphalist stealth jihad\". It does not \"loom\" over the \"hallowed ground\" of the 9/11 attacks, which cannot be seen from its site.\\n\\nAs to what it is, the explanation is not at first very enlightening. Park51, to use the project\\'s proper name, is \"a friendly and accessible platform\" that \"enriches lower Manhattan in body and spirit, with ecologically conscious design and operation\". However, its architect, Michel Abboud, makes things clearer: it is a Muslim version of the YMCA, or the many Jewish community centres in New York. That is, it will have a swimming pool, basketball court, childcare and exhibition facilities, a library, auditorium, restaurant and catering school. As with the Christian and Jewish versions, you won\\'t have to be a believer to use these facilities.\\n\\nWhen built, it will be 16 storeys high, and 10% of its floor area will be a \"prayer space\". It will be large â big enough for 1,500 people â but there will be no minaret, or room for ablutions, or other essential features of a mosque. Its religious elements would be \"a matter of interior design\", as Abboud puts it, and faiths and groups other than Muslims will be able to pray there. The project now has planning permission and, subject to fundraising, will be completed, at the earliest, in three years\\' time.\\n\\nAs Abboud tells it, the year\\'s most controversial building project came about almost by chance, through a sequence of reasonable decisions. It started when the developer Soho Properties bought the former Burlington Coat Factory in Park Avenue, lower Manhattan. It considered potential uses, conducted market research, and found that there was a need for \"community facilities\" in the area. Sharif El-Gamal, a Muslim American who runs Soho Properties, attended the nearby mosque of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who had been working in the area for 30 years.\\n\\nTogether they decided to create what is now Park51. That the project was close to Ground Zero was due to El-Gamal\\'s and Rauf\\'s long connections with the area. But they were conscious of the significance of the place, and it was not unwelcome to them. Rauf has said that it gave an opportunity to make \"the opposite statement\" to the destruction of the Twin Towers.\\n\\nAbboud is a young architect on the rise, who \"started building projects before I graduated\", and now, at 33, runs Soma Architects, a practice with 30 staff and offices in New York, Mexico and Beirut. Its work so far has consisted mostly of smart restaurants and luxury residential projects â nothing approaching the significance of Park51. He is a walking melting pot, albeit of a somewhat privileged kind, a Catholic of French, Lebanese and Mexican origins.\\n\\n\"The difficulty from day one,\" he tells me with some understatement, \"was to satisfy all the different parties: the developers, the religious institution and the average New Yorker.\" The building had to promote \"integration and unity\", and be \"porous and open to the city\" while \"maintaining a landmark quality\". He was \"not going to fall into stereotypical illusions of what Islamic architecture looks like\".\\n\\nHe conceived a \"self-supporting exoskeleton\", a white lattice that holds the building up, creates shade, and defines the character of the interiors. It is inspired by mashrabiyas, the elaborately patterned sunscreens common in Islamic architecture. He is not, he stresses, the first western architect to have this idea: Jean Nouvel\\'s 1988 Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris, for one, did something similar. The designs of Abboud\\'s lattice are based on \"ancient historical patterns that have a very long story to them\", but \"some people imagined there were reversed Stars of David included as a provocation to Jews\". It was \"only a few people, and very far-fetched\", but he is still responding by making the traditional patterns \"more blurred\".\\n\\nThe design is \"still evolving, but I expect the finished building to have a similar concept\". Abboud claims that \"every time the project is presented properly, without the media swirl, people respond positively\".\\n\\nIndeed, the idea of the project was in the public domain for six months, following its announcement in the New York Times a year ago, before anyone made a fuss. It was approved unanimously by the local Community Board in May. Only after that, with the US midterm elections looming, was a political storm whipped around it. Abboud believes that slow progress on the 9/11 memorial, which is now due to be dedicated at next year\\'s 10th anniversary, did not help. \"Whether consciously or unconsciously, people feared the centre could be built before the Ground Zero memorial was built.\"\\n\\nIt probably also doesn\\'t help that the project is nuanced and ambiguous. As a 16-storey building for a Muslim group, located where it is, it is clearly a statement of something, but it is not completely explicit what this something is.

The column was iconic not just because it was the last major component of the towers to be cleared from the site, but because it had come to be used as a place of commemoration for families of victims and rescue workers.\\n\\nThe steel structure is covered in markings and inscriptions such as PAPD 37, NYPD 23 and FDNY 343 - listings of the death toll for local emergency workers (FDNY 343, for instance, refers to the 343 firefighters who died after responding to the attacks).\\n\\nThere are also tributes and memorial cards with photographs attached to several of those who died in the attacks.\\n\\nConservation workers have painstakingly worked to keep all the inscriptions in tact. Each spray-painted memorial has been photographed and then protected with preservative paste.\\n\\nThe column has been sealed with a special wrap, and once in place it will be surrounded by a climate-controlled box to guard it until the museum is completed. In effect, the museum will be built around it as the structure is so large it could not be introduced once the building is constructed.\\n\\nNew York officials are scrambling to have the memorial and museum ready for public access by the 10th anniversary of the attacks in 2011. But like much of the story of the rebuilding of the World Trace Centre site, they have laboured against multiple delays and budget overruns.\\n\\nThe project, which is now costing over $1bn (Â£609m), is unlikely to be fully finished until 2012 or 2013, although the authorities still insist some public access will be available by the 10th anniversary.\\n\\nThe twin towers will be recalled with two giant reflective pools in the shape of their footprints; that of the north tower is already clearly visible at the site and the base of the waterfall that will flow there has been installed.', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1017\\\\4.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/20/dutch-wilders-ground-zero-mosque', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/18/1282152343356/Site-Of-Proposed-Ground-Z-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa76da4012ee9d133fd81319221beba5', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1017\\\\3.txt', 'title': \"Leaders fear for Netherlands' image as anti-Islam populist turns kingmaker | New York | The Guardian\", 'content': 'The Dutch government has launched a damage-limitation campaign to try to counter what it fears is the disastrous international impact of the Islam-bashing populist Geert Wilders.\\n\\nWilders, whose success in June\\'s general election catapulted him into the role of kingmaker in attempts to form a new coalition government, is to travel to New York to take part in protests on 11 September against the proposed Muslim community centre near Ground Zero.\\n\\nMaxime Verhagen, the acting foreign minister and Christian Democrats\\' leader, has voiced fears that Wilders\\'s speech in New York will tarnish Dutch reputations. He has also taken the unusual step of circulating confidential orders to Dutch diplomats around the world on how to answer questions about Wilders\\'s influence in a new government and on the fallout for Muslims in the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith characteristic robustness, Wilders has told Verhagen to mind his own business. He clearly intends to grab attention with a tub-thumping exercise in Islamophobia in New York.\\n\\n\"Good feeling. Important speech. No one will stop me. No mosque at Ground Zero,\" he tweeted after booking a flight to New York. \"Stop Islam, defend freedom\" is his rallying cry.\\n\\nThe tensions over 9/11 and New York come as Wilders savours his growing clout at home. His Freedom party is running at 31% in the most recent opinion poll, ahead of all other contenders, and he has spent most of this week at a secret location with Verhagen and Mark Rutte, the liberals\\' leader, haggling over the terms for a new coalition government.\\n\\nWilders, whose party almost tripled its seats, from nine to 24, in the June election, is not joining the new cabinet. Instead, he will prop up a rightwing coalition of liberals and Christian Democrats in return for pledges of a tough new crackdown on immigration and other policy concessions. If the talks succeed, Wilders will be in the enviable position of wielding power while abjuring responsibility.\\n\\nThe negotiations have been going on for a fortnight and are supposed to be concluded next week. But they are said to be going badly.\\n\\nA coalition backed by Wilders would command the slimmest of majorities â 76 seats in the 150-seat second chamber or lower house. The Trouw newspaper yesterday reported at least one dissident Christian Democrat MP would not support it, making it unviable.\\n\\nVerhagen is in a difficult position. While negotiating with Wilders, he is also telling his diplomats how to undermine the rightwing maverick. Verhagen faces mounting resistance within his own party to collaborating, even if only tacitly, with Wilders.\\n\\nLast week German Christian Democrats joined Dutch party dissidents in calling for a boycott of Wilders.\\n\\nThe latest opinion polls show Wilders soaring ahead of Rutte\\'s liberal VVD party. Rutte, who is expected to be the new prime minister, supports an immigration crackdown and other anti-EU and hardline policies demanded by Wilders. But the two rightwingers are split over the main issue â austerity and budget cuts. Rutte is committed to slashing public spending by â¬18bn to halve the budget deficit from almost 7%. He is demanding health service, education, welfare and social security cuts.\\n\\nWilders, who is being prosecuted in Amsterdam on charges of inciting hatred and discrimination, is portraying himself as the protector of Dutch welfare, while calling for a tax on Islamic headscarves, a ban on the Qur\\'an, closure of Islamic schools, deportation of immigrants and proscribing mosque-building.\\n\\nVerhagen has told his ambassadors how to cope with foreigners\\' questions such as \"What will that mean for the treatment of Muslims?\" if Wilders props up a new government.', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1017\\\\3.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/20/obama-muslim-ground-zero-mosque', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/18/1282152343356/Site-Of-Proposed-Ground-Z-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa76da4012ee9d133fd81319221beba5', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1017\\\\5.txt', 'title': \"Barack Obama, 'Muslim' president | Wajahat Ali | The Guardian\", 'content': 'One wonders why only 20% of Americans believe President Barack Obama is a Muslim, considering the overwhelming evidence conclusively proving his slavish allegiance to Islam and utter disregard for Christianity.\\n\\nAfter Obama\\'s wishy-washy defence of Muslim Americans\\' freedom to build a community centre, which includes a mosque, two blocks away from Ground Zero, a poll from the Pew Research Centre reveals that nearly 20% of Americans â up from 11% a year ago â consider him a Muslim, and nearly 43% are unsure of his religion.\\n\\nAs a Muslim American, I presciently spotted the tell-tale signs of Obama\\'s Muslimy-ness and raucously celebrated â along with the entire monolithic entity of 1.5bn Muslims â our successful Islamisation of America. With one of us finally implanted in the White House and the other wearing a Miss USA tiara, minarets on the Capitol and a burqa-clad Hillary Clinton were only a lunar cycle away.\\n\\nThe smoking gun proving Obama belonged to the \"stars and crescent\" occurred during his interview with influential pastor Rick Warren, when he publicly admitted: \"I believe Jesus died for my sins and I\\'m redeemed through him â that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis.\" Further testimony came with his 2009 Notre Dame graduation speech, where Obama referenced his community organising days in Chicago, boldly declaring: \"â¦ it was through this service I was brought to Christ.\"\\n\\nHis decisive break with Christianity and subsequent undying fealty to the Islamic empire clearly then occurred at the White House Easter prayer breakfast, where he welcomed the esteemed guests as his \"brothers and sisters in Christ\". And how can one forget Obama publicly denouncing Reverend Jeremiah Wright, his pastor for over 20 years at the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago?\\n\\nHowever, despite this powerful evidence of his Islamic faith, my mind is plagued with doubts concerning Obama\\'s authentic Muslim credibility. The world takes photos of him eating lunch during Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims in which we abstain from food and drink until sunset. Also, Obama apparently likes beer â which is strictly forbidden in Islam â and he never hesitates to flagrantly exhibit this sin. Memorable examples include his drinking bout with Professor Henry Louis Gates\\' arresting officer, Sgt Crowley, or his chugging a few bottles while awkwardly bowling to pacify nervous, middle-class white voters in Pennsylvania during the primaries.\\n\\nIt also appears that Obama indulges in eating swine â thoroughly forbidden for Muslims â and he was subsequently caught devouring a tasty piece of salami with Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, who may also be a closet Muslim given his recent stirring and eloquent defence of religious liberties in light of the Park 51 mosque controversy.\\n\\nSo I worry about my Muslim brother\\'s observance. In over two years, Obama has yet to step foot in a mosque. Furthermore, when given the ripe opportunity to pick a Muslim judge for the supreme court â thereby implementing sharia law through stealth judicial activism â Obama instead nominated Elena Kagan (a Jew and a female to boot!). His cabinet, which counsels him on the most critical domestic and foreign policy issues, does not contain even one member with an Arabic name.\\n\\nAnd despite all the president\\'s obvious Muslim credentials and avowed commitment to convert America to an Islamic theocracy, there are only two elected Muslim American officials out of 435 Congress members. What is more, hummus has not supplanted peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, hookahs have yet to be installed in congressional chambers, male elected officials continue shaving their facial hair, Egyptian soap operas and al-Jazeera have yet to replace Fox News and CNN, and the Iron Sheik, sadly, is still not the White House spokesman.\\n\\nAnd yet, many impassioned and determined voices continue proclaiming Obama a \"card-carrying Muslim\".\\n\\nObjectively reviewing the evidence, one notices that Obama\\'s middle name is indeed shared by a recently deposed Iraqi dictator, and the president\\'s first and last name contain superfluous multisyllables. Also, Obama, who is biracial and raised primarily by his white, Christian mother, had a Kenyan father, who was a (non-practising) Muslim. Further, the family lived in Indonesia, a Muslim country, for nearly four years. Obama also wore a traditional African turban and dress â a little too confidently and comfortably â while visiting Kenya in 2006, and he said \"Assalam aleikum\" â a little too eloquently â while addressing Muslims in his famous Cairo speech.\\n\\nIf one was to disavow common sense, history, evidence and truth, and, instead, rely purely on hysteria and hearsay created out of conjecture, then perhaps superficial appearances do conclusively prove Obama is a Muslim. Following this logic, Bill O\\'Reilly could secretly be a Manchurian Candidate for Hamas because of his prolific knowledge of Arabic, as gleaned from his usage of \"loofah\" and \"falafel\" when allegedly attempted to sexually harass a female producer. George W Bush could potentially be a covert, homosexual Saudi Arabia spy, since photos show him holding hands with Prince Abdullah and kissing him on the cheek. Rachel Ray, that perky culinary superstar, could be cooking lethal, anthrax-laced batches of girl scout cookies for Hezbollah, because, after all, she wore a keffiyeh in a Dunkin\\' Donuts commercial.\\n\\nAfter review, the evidence produces a hung jury in deciding whether or not Obama is a Muslim. But, even if he is one, it appears he is a \"secular Muslim\" â precisely the type Pamela Geller, the rightwing blogger responsible for creating much of the anti-NYC mosque hysteria, allegedly welcomes with open arms. She and her likeminded ilk should embrace \"secular\" Obama, who drinks beer, eats pork and doesn\\'t observe Ramadan, instead of relentlessly demonising him.\\n\\nIt seems, after all, that his \"Muslim\" values coincide closely with American family values â of being married, staying loyal to your wife, raising well-behaved children, actively helping neighbours and contributing to the public good of the community members, as he did in Chicago. With his deep understanding of \"Muslim culture\", the president could also foster conciliation and healing with Muslim communities in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. Finally, Obama being a Muslim would permanently negate al-Qaida\\'s narrative that America is at \"war with Islam\". How could \"America\" hate Islam if American citizens had elected a biracial citizen with an Arabic name and non-Christian religion as their president?\\n\\nThankfully, at least 80% of Americans seem impervious to the \"Obama is a Muslim\" Kool-Aid being peddled abundantly by a reactionary minority. But that 20%, maybe more, choose to remain ignorant of American principles and history, thereby paralysing their ability to reflect on how similar fear tactics, baseless doubts and paranoid allegations smeared another US president nearly 50 years ago. His name was John F Kennedy and his offence was to be a Catholic.\\n\\nThe irony of this shameful debacle is that Obama is, in fact, a \"card-carrying Christian\". Ultimately, it suggests the question: had he actually been Muslim, or instead been Hindu, Jewish or atheist, would he be any less American?\\n\\nThe overwhelming evidence suggests not.', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1017\\\\5.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/12/ground-zero-mosque-islamophobia', 'image_link': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/18/1282152343356/Site-Of-Proposed-Ground-Z-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa76da4012ee9d133fd81319221beba5', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1017\\\\6.txt', 'title': \"Ground Zero mosque plans 'fuelling anti-Muslim protests across US' | US news | The Guardian\", 'content': 'The battle over plans to build a mosque near the site of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York is fuelling a surge in anti-Muslim protests across the US, including opposition to new Islamic centres from California to Georgia.\\n\\nReligious leaders and civil rights activists warn that a tide of Islamophobia that has swept the country since the destruction of the twin towers is being heightened by political exploitation of the New York dispute before nationwide elections and is increasingly bound up with hostility to immigrants and other forms of racism.\\n\\nThey say the outpouring of condemnation at the \"outrage\" of a mosque close to the \"hallowed ground\" of the World Trade Centre site also goes hand in hand with the increasing acceptability of what they describe as hate speech.\\n\\nA Florida church, Dove World Outreach Centre, is planning a \"burn the Qur\\'an\" day on September 11 and has already outraged Muslims by planting a sign on its front lawn that reads: Islam is the Devil.\\n\\nThe church\\'s senior pastor, Terry Jones, has said he is \"exposing Islam for what it is\".\\n\\n\"It is a violent and oppressive religion that is trying to masquerade itself as a religion of peace, seeking to deceive our society,\" the church said. \"Islam is a lie based upon lies and deceptions and fear.

Opposition to a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, intensified after Republican candidates for Congress and state governor made opposition part of their campaigns.\\n\\nSarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate, has been a vocal opponent of the controversial New York mosque.\\n\\nOther prominent politicians have cast the net wider. Newt Gingrich, the Republican former speaker of the House of Representatives, who is thought likely to make a run for president, has warned that Muslims are attempting to impose sharia law in the US and that it poses a \"mortal threat to freedom\" in America.\\n\\nGingrich said that he would push for legislation to prevent states from adopting sharia law even though none are proposing it and there is no likely prospect of it happening.\\n\\nEsposito said politicians\\' fearmongering over Muslims was similar to exploitation of fears that the country was being swamped by a tide of illegal immigrants.\\n\\n\"Islamophobia is not just about religion. It\\'s about people who are of colour and a whole set of presuppositions about these people,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You can see it not only with Muslims but with Mexicans, people who look Hispanic.

They were doing a surveillance project on E. coli bacteria from food animals in China. A whopping 15% of meat samples and 21% of animals tested between 2011 and 2014 also had bacteria that carried this gene. The researchers from South China also found this resistance gene in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia isolates from 16 hospitalized patientsâ blood, urine or other sites. The isolates were all very resistant ESBL bacteria to begin with, so now were resistant to all antibiotics.\\n\\nIt gets worse. This week, Frank Aarestrupâs team, from the Danish National Food Institute, reported that they also searched their collection of bacteria, looking for this new gene. They found the mcr-1 gene in the blood of a patient and in 5 poultry samples that originated in Germany between 2012-14. The patient had not left the country and was believed to have become infected by eating contaminated meat. The genes found in the poultry were identical to those from the Danish patient and from China.\\n\\nWhy is this important?\\n\\nThe mcr-1 gene transfers resistance to E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonasâcommon bacteriaâby plasmids, small bits of DNA that can be transferred to different types of bacteria. Previously, colistin resistance was transferred on chromosomes, and therefore affected only those bacteria and their descendants. Plasmid-borne resistance genes are more likely to be rapidly spread widely, and can spread between species of bacteria. According to George Washington Universityâs Dr. Lance Price, itâs a bit less likely to be a problem with Salmonella for now, as âwe donât have those bordering on pan-resistance like E. coli.â\\n\\nOne of the problems is that colistin is widely used in Chinaâs agriculture industry. Co-author Professor Jianzhong Shen explains, \"The selective pressure imposed by increasingly heavy use of colistin in agriculture in China could have led to the acquisition of mcr-1 by E. coli.\"\\n\\nThe WHO called for limiting the use of colistin in 2012, calling it a critically important antibiotic. Yet most of the 12,000 tons of colistin fed to livestock each year is in China. In Europe, polymyxins (the colistin class) were the 5th most heavily used type of antibiotic in agricultural use in 2013. Colistin is not widely used in the U.S., but it is not prohibited either.\\n\\nAs Iâve mentioned in a previous post, colistin is a nasty antibiotic. Until the past few years, when we were desperate for options for treating carbapenem resistant bacteria (CRE), it was not used due to its toxicity. Iâve had to use it a rarely, resulting in inevitable renal failure in the patients receiving it.\\n\\nFood Security\\n\\nWith all the previous scandals about tainted products from China (remember melamine, for example?), the finding of rather widespread mcr-1 in Chinese meat samples again raises the question of whether we should allow reimportation of meat processed in China.\\n\\nCurrently, the U.S. imports tilapia from China, some of which has been contaminated by manure, and much of which is farm-raised and likely exposed to antibiotics. In 2013, the Chinaâs Shuanghui International group bought Smithfield ham, reportedly with the goal of acquiring a source of pork and our government supported technology without incurring any of the huge environmental costs of the meat industry. They have not been processing pork and returning it to us. There were rumors of U.S. beef being processed in China and then returned, but this appears to be unsubstantiated.\\n\\nHog confinement barn - EPA/Wikipedia\\n\\nThorough cooking should kill any bacteria. If you like rare meat, keep in mind that meat that is âtenderizedâ may not be as safe, as the needles or blades used to cut the meat also carries in bacteria from the surface of the meat. Tenderized beef has been linked to outbreaks of E. coli O157.\\n\\nI was not entirely reassured by this government statement either:\\n\\nâThe U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has announced that China is eligible to export processed, cooked chicken to the United States.\\n\\nWith the recent Chipotle E. coli outbreak, itâs not hard to imagine the nightmare scenario of a foodborne outbreak from one of these new, highly resistant strains.\\n\\nDr. Price raises another intriguing possibility as well; heâs found that some urinary tract infections are foodborne in origin, with multi-drug resistant E. coli being correlating with eating poultry. âWe are really facing a time when we could be finding an untreatable uropathogen in our food. We donât recognize urogenic E. coli as a foodborne pathogen.â He also expressed frustration to me that âWe have no regulatory tools to stop the trade of these productsâ because these strains of resistant bacteria (like E. coli ST131) are classified as ânormal floraâ and not pathogens, as E. coli O157 (linked to foodborne outbreaks) is.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAgricultural use of antibiotics is by far the greatest threat to us, promoting drug resistance on a grander scale than hospital use. We must get all countries to agree to eliminate colistin and carbapenem antibiotics, in particular, from animal use. They are our last ditch antibiotics at a time when there is little drug development. This, and limiting some types of food imports, will slow the tide of this latest superbug threatening us. Its arrival is inevitable though, given global travel and trade. Weâll just need to keep our finger in the dike for now while hoping that the government will restrict the importation of foods likely to be carriers of this gene, greatly reduce or bar the use of critical antibiotics in agriculture, and will allocate new resources to the development of treatments for these resistant organisms.', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\102\\\\0.jpg'}]}\n",

We have added it to a list of your favorite stories.\\n\\nBy MATTHEW LEE and KIMBERLY DOZIER\\nAssociated Press\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) â  The Obama administration was caught by surprise by the ferocity of the Sept. 11 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the ambassador and three other Americans. Now it is bracing for another potential eruption of violent demonstrations in parts of the Muslim world after Friday\\'s weekly prayers â  traditionally a time of protest in the Middle East and North Africa.\\n\\nAngry demonstrations over an anti-Islam video already have occurred in Egypt and Yemen, and officials theorize that well-armed Libyan extremists hijacked a similar protest in Benghazi, where several Libyan security guards also were killed. The U.S. put all of its diplomatic missions overseas on high alert, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered an explicit denunciation of the video as the administration sought to pre-empt further turmoil at its embassies and consulates.\\n\\n\"The United States government had absolutely nothing to do with this video,\" she said before a meeting with the foreign minister of Morocco at the State Department. \"We absolutely reject its content and message.\"\\n\\nMPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all.\\n\\n\"To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible,\" Clinton said. \"It appears to have a deeply cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage.\"\\n\\nU.S. officials said they suspect that the attack at the Benghazi consulate, which had also been the target of an unsuccessful attack in June, may have been only tangentially related to the film.\\n\\nMORE LIBYA COVERAGE\\nâ¢ US ambassador, 3 staffers, killed in Libya\\nâ¢ The Cairo embassy statementâ¢ President Barack Obama\\'s official statement\\nâ¢ Secretary of State Clinton\\'s official statement\\nâ¢ Romney accuses president of sending \\'mixed signals\\'\\nâ¢ Obama: Romney tends to \\'shoot first and aim later\\'\\nâ¢ Californian admits role in anti-Islam film\\n\\nThey also stressed there had been no advance warning or intelligence to suggest a threat in Libya that would warrant boosting security, even on the 11th anniversary of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\\n\\n\"As we did with all of our missions overseas, in advance of the September 11 anniversary and as we do every year, we did evaluate the threat stream and we determined that the security at Benghazi was appropriate for what we knew,\" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.\\n\\nThe intelligence leading up to the attacks will be examined to \"see if there was any way of forecasting this violence,\" as in any violent incident, House Intelligence Committee member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in an interview Thursday. But he said the focus now \"has to be on finding out who is responsible and bringing them to justice.\"\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama, speaking a campaign event in Golden, Colorado, also vowed that the perpetrators would be punished.\\n\\n\"I want people around the world to hear me,\" he said. \"To all those who would do us harm: No act of terror will go unpunished. I will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world. No act of violence shakes the resolve of the United States of America.\"\\n\\nAs of Thursday morning, there was no intelligence indicating that what happened in Benghazi was planned, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation into the attack. Intelligence officials said they believe it\\'s more likely that the attack was \"opportunistic or spontaneous,\" with militants taking advantage of the demonstration to launch the assault. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation publicly.\\n\\nThere is also no evidence that the attack was tied to 9/11, one of the officials said. But the Libyan-based militant group Ansar al Sharia is the leading suspect for carrying out the violence, possibly with help from al-Qaida\\'s main African-based offshoot, Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. The officials said it may be hard to determine definitively which group was responsible, because many militants are members of both.\\n\\nLibyan officials arrested an unspecified number of militants suspected of taking part in the attack and they were closely monitoring others to see whether they are linked to a group.\\n\\nDespite the belief that the militants who hit the consulate did so separately from the protests over the film, U.S. officials are deeply concerned that extremists may take advantage of non-violent demonstrations to copycat the Benghazi raid, or that otherwise peaceful protesters may be incited to attack because of the video, particularly on Friday.\\n\\nIt\\'s virtually impossible to predict when a crowd might form and turn violent, according to retired U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, who served as chief of mission at five posts, including Iraq, and is a former director of national intelligence.\\n\\n\"These things can be mobilized on the spur of the moment, set off by a spark,\" especially in places such as Egypt and Libya where the ruling strongmen have just fallen, Negroponte said Thursday. \"When you get rid of authoritarian regimes, there\\'s little or no institutional framework left. ...That\\'s why there\\'s disorder and chaos\" that is so easily hijacked, he said.\\n\\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday denounced the violence, and also the provocative video. \"Nothing justifies such killings and attacks,\" Ban said in a statement, adding that he condemns \"the hateful film that appears to have been deliberately designed to sow bigotry and bloodshed.\"\\n\\nEgypt\\'s ruling Muslim Brotherhood called for demonstrations after Friday prayers as did authorities in Iran and the Gaza strip. Large protests were expected in Baghdad and Iraq\\'s second-largest city, Basra, as well as Amman, Jordan. Israel was stepping up security in anticipation of demonstrations after Muslim prayers.\\n\\nThe White House said it was prepared for more protests but stressed that any violence would be unjustified.\\n\\n\"It is important to note that as these protests are taking place in different countries around the world, responding to the movie, that Friday, tomorrow, has historically been a day when there are protests in the Muslim world,\" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters in Colorado. \"And we are watching very closely for developments that could lead to more protests. We anticipate that they may continue.\"\\n \\n \\n\\tWhile rejecting the content of the video, Clinton stressed that no matter how offensive it is, the film cannot be used as an excuse for violence like that seen in Egypt, where a mob breached the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo on Wednesday, and in Yemen, where demonstrators tried to storm the embassy compound in Sana on Thursday.\\n\\n\"There is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence,\" Clinton said. \"We condemn the violence that has resulted in the strongest terms. ... It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better understanding across countries and cultures.\"\\n\\nShe then reminded foreign governments that they have a responsibility to protect embassies.\\n\\nAround the world, U.S. missions issued warnings to Americans about demonstrations that could turn violent.

None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.\\n\\nIt also provided for the first time an explanation for why the CIA had a station in Benghazi. The report states that the CIA was using its Benghazi station to track weapons smuggling from Libya to Syria -- the first official indication that within months of the demise of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, U.S. officials were aware that Benghazi had become an important source for weapons reaching Syria.\\n\\nThe report concluded that neither the CIA nor the U.S. military delayed their response to the attack, rebutting accusations that a slow response was in part responsible for Stevens\\' death.\\n\\nThe report reveals new details about the chaos that surrounded the response to the attack. It said CIA security contractors at a CIA annex not far from the mission were prepared to leave to render assistance within five minutes of learning of the attack, but that it took them 42 minutes to make the 1.4-mile drive because attackers had blocked the roads. By the time they arrived, the compound\\'s buildings were ablaze, and Stevens and Smith were dead from smoke inhalation.\\n\\nThe nearby CIA annex itself came under attacks that were far more sophisticated, the report states, than what had taken place at the special mission, including three precise mortar barrages that in the space of a minute and nine seconds killed the two former Navy SEALs who were part of the CIA security team, Doherty and Woods.\\n\\nThe report also described 3Â½ hours of chaos at the airport when additional security personnel arrived in Benghazi from Tripoli. A truck they\\'d expected to meet them at the airport did not arrive, the Libyan general who had supposedly arranged for the transport had turned off his cellphone and Libyan militiamen who were at the airport were unwilling to travel to the hospital where the Americans believed Stevens was being treated. The arriving Americans were uncertain which of the militias they could trust, the report states.\\n\\nThe report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.\\n\\nThe intelligence community, the report states, had written 429 \"cables, reports and assessments\" on security in Libya between February and October 2012.\\n\\n\"CIA security personnel testified that State Department [diplomatic security] agents repeatedly stated they felt ill-equipped and ill-trained to contend with the threat environment in Benghazi,\" the report states. \"According to eyewitnesses ... the DS agents knew well before the attacks that they could not defend the [Special Mission] against an armed assault.\"\\n\\nThe report states that State Department security agents had told their CIA counterparts that they\\'d requested \"additional resources\" and that those requests were \"with the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.\"\\n\\n\"The CIA security contractors noted the security flaws of the [Special Mission],\" the report states. \"In their view, it was a very large compound with too few guards and large spaces for attackers, such as snipers, to hide.\"\\n\\nStevens was making his first visit to Benghazi since becoming ambassador the previous May. According to the report, Stevens had a \"long conversation\" with the CIA station chief in Tripoli about the security issues a few days before the attack. But the report does not say who decided that it would be safe for Stevens to travel there.\\n\\n\"We spent thousands of hours asking questions, poring over documents, reviewing intelligence assessments, reading cables and emails, and held a total of 20 committee events and hearings,\" said Rep.

Rice repeated talking points that wrongly described it as a protest over a video deemed offensive to Muslims.\\n\\nBut Rice\\'s comments were based on faulty intelligence from multiple agencies, according to the report. Analysts received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi, the report states -- 14 from the Open Source Center, which reviews news reports; one from the CIA; two from the Defense Department; and four from the National Security Agency.\\n\\nThe report nonetheless documents that White House officials were eager to embrace the initial, inaccurate account. It cites an email from Ben Rhodes, Obama\\'s deputy national security adviser, who urged Rice \"to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.\"\\n\\nIn the years since, some participants in the attack have said they were motivated by the video. The attackers were a mix of extremists and hangers-on, the investigation found.\\n\\n\"To this day,\" the report states, \"significant intelligence gaps regarding the identities, affiliations and motivations of the attackers remain.\"\\n\\nThe report concludes that the CIA repeatedly and \"specifically highlighted the threats to Western interests in Libya\" in the run-up to the attack but had no intelligence that the U.S. Special Mission or the annex would be attacked that night. The only intelligence about the attack came from a member of the Transitional National Security council who heard about it \"very shortly\" beforehand and informed the Libyan government.

Also, Hillary Clinton â in a grossly negligent manner â led the terrorists to kill their sons.âA Clinton spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The suit threatens to revive both Benghazi and the Clinton private emails as campaign issues.âFor a lot of people who are looking for reasons to not support Hillary, this suit is yet another reason,â said Brad Marston, a ?Republican consultant.\\n\\nâIf the story gets any traction, it will have an effect on the narrative, and itâs ?another instance of waiting for another shoe to drop,â Marston said. âItâs another cloud over her campaign.âSome GOP pundits said they had little faith that the families would be successful in suing Clinton, but that just bringing the suit reminds the public of the misdeeds she has been accused of over the years.âThe conversation is ?important and the fact that it has been picked up again is important,â said Marty Connors, a Republican strategist and former Alabama GOP state chairman.âOther than getting headlines, litigation isnât going to solve any problems, but it will keep the Benghazi story alive, which it needs to be,â Connors said.Democrats, meanwhile, said the GOP should be wary before making the new lawsuit a story because it could backfire and push people toward Clinton.âYou run the risk that there is a sympathetic backlash because people think this whole thing is crazy at some point,â said Scott Ferson, a Democratic consultant.âIâm not saying thatâs the motivation behind the suit, but itâs the optics of making it a story,â Ferson said. âIf Republicans jump on it, people may see it as a bit of overreach.âMarston argued that the suit could help counter the ânarrative that the media is using against Donald Trumpâ and his dealings with Khizr and Ghazala Khan â American Muslims whose son was slain in the Iraq War and have publicly attacked the Republican nominee.âI think it balances the controversy,â he said. âNow you have the parents of Benghazi victims going after Clinton.

The closest military backup was hours away, which later led to fierce debate about how U.S. troops should be postured to protect Americans and diplomatic posts overseas.\\n\\n\"There was no one even remotely close to being able to go and get them in North Africa,\" a source familiar with the operation planning said. \"The nearest airplanes were hours away and the nearest ground troops a day away or further.\"\\n\\nThe source spoke under the condition of anonymity to talk freely about the Sept. 11, 2012, incident, which remains a topic of controversy in Washington seven years later.\\n\\nThe scene was chaotic when the team arrived, and they quickly tried to restore order. There were nearly 30 panicked people who needed to be evacuated quickly, but the compound was under fire from multiple sides.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, it was not a whole lot of offense; it was a whole lot of just holding guys off as long as they could to try and get out,\" the person familiar with the mission said.\\n\\nJolly, who declined a request for an interview, would ultimately be awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism there. The soldier with him, Master Sgt. David Halbruner, received the Army\\'s Distinguished Service Cross. The valor awards are exceeded only by the Medal of Honor.\\n\\nLittle has been known about Jollyâs actions in Benghazi. There was no public ceremony when he received his valor award and, until recently, his name has not been publicly tied to the mission in media reports.\\n\\nHis hometown paper in North Carolina, the Wilkes Journal-Patriot, recently reported that the 36-year-old who\\'d graduated from high school about 90 miles north of Charlotte was the Marine who\\'d gone above and beyond to save other Americans. Jolly recently retired as a master sergeant.\\n\\nAccording to testimony, public documents and the person familiar with his actions, Jolly was calm in the face of deadly chaos. He and Halbruner are credited with saving numerous lives that day.\\n\\nWith a rifle strapped to his back amid an onslaught of mortars and machine-gun fire, Jolly tended to the wounded, at one point throwing a man onto his back and shuffling him down a ladder amid a barrage of enemy fire. He helped some get back into the fight and provided vital care to others with life-threatening injuries.\\n\\nHere\\'s how then-Gunnery Sgt. Jolly helped get other Americans to safety during a situation that caused a years-long political firestorm thousands of miles away in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nJolly, an infantry assault Marine, was assigned to a Delta Force detachment in Libya at the time of the Benghazi attack. It\\'s rare, though not unheard of, for Marines to join the elite Army special-operations teams.\\n\\nThe Marine had deployed to Iraq twice before joining the secretive counterterrorism force, spending about five years carrying out clandestine missions before the Benghazi attack and another five after, according to information about his career obtained by Military.com.\\n\\nHe racked up more than a dozen total deployments with Delta Force.\\n\\nThe Navy Cross Jolly received for his actions in Benghazi was his fourth valor award. He has two Bronze Stars with combat \"V\" devices -- one of which he earned for undisclosed reasons during his time with Delta Force, and a second from a 2004-2005 deployment to Ramadi, Iraq.\\n\\nJolly also earned a Navy Commendation Medal with combat distinguishing device and a Purple Heart for injuries sustained during that deployment.\\n\\nAccording to his award citations, Jolly repeatedly braved enemy fire in Ramadi to help take out an enemy sniper who had ambushed a government center. He received the Navy Commendation Medal for risking his life to destroy roadside bombs when an explosive ordnance disposal team couldn\\'t reach his unit.\\n\\nOn the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Jolly was about 600 miles away from Benghazi in Tripoli -- roughly the same distance between Chicago and Washington, D.C. Since Jolly and Halbruner were some of the only troops in-country, the operation was coordinated not by U.S. Africa Command, but the CIA.\\n\\nTeam Tripoli, made up of Jolly, Halbruner and five others, arrived in Benghazi at about 1:30 a.m. That was about four hours after the attack began, and two since Ambassador Christopher J. Stevens had last been seen alive.\\n\\nThe team was led by Glen Doherty, a Global Response Staff (GRS) security officer and former Navy SEAL, who was later killed. He was Team Tripoli\\'s medic.\\n\\nThe plan, according to the person familiar with the mission, was to leave the airport and head to the hospital, where they believed Stevens was being treated. When they found out Stevens had died, the first ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979, the team headed to the consulate to bolster the diplomatic security personnel and GRS, a group of private military contractors who were fending off the attackers.\\n\\n\"It could\\'ve gone really, really bad,\" said the source familiar with the mission. \"It could\\'ve become 30 American hostages in North Africa. There were seven shooters going in to protect people who don\\'t shoot for a living.\"\\n\\nBy the time they arrived, Sean Smith, a State Department foreign service officer, had also died. It was still dark, just after 5 a.m., according to a congressional timeline of the attack. Within minutes, the first mortar hit.\\n\\nThe attacks continued, with one witness estimating there were as many as 100 insurgents spotted surrounding their location in 20- or 30-man groups. It was a skilled enemy, one of the troops there later told members of Congress.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not easy ... to shoot inside the city and get something on the target within two shots -- that\\'s difficult,\" the witness testified. \"I would say they were definitely a trained mortar team or had been trained to do something similar to that.\\n\\n\"I was kind of surprised,\" the service member added. \"... It was unusual.\"\\n\\nThey were there a matter of hours, but at times witnesses said the team feared they wouldn\\'t make it out alive. It began to \"rain down on us,\" one of them told lawmakers.\\n\\n\\'\\'I really believe that this attack was planned,\" the witness said. \"The accuracy with which the mortars hit us was too good for any regular revolutionaries.\"\\n\\nIn total, six 81-millimeter mortars assaulted the annex within a minute and 13 seconds, a congressional report on the attack states. Doherty and Tyrone Woods, another former SEAL with the GRS, didn\\'t survive.\\n\\nDave Ubben, a State Department security agent, and Mark \"Oz\" Geist, another GRS member, were badly hurt. The men were defending the compound from the rooftop, determined to make it look like they had a lot more firepower than they actually did.\\n\\n\"There was a lot of shooting, a lot of indirect fire and explosions,\" the source with knowledge of the response said. \"It was just guys being really aggressive and doing a good job at making it seem like their element was bigger than it was, like they were less hurt than they were.\"\\n\\nUbben -- who\\'d testified before a federal court in 2017 that he took shrapnel to his head, nearly lost his leg, and had a grapefruit-sized piece of his arm taken off -- was losing blood fast. Geist also had a serious arm injury that needed immediate attention.\\n\\nJolly and Halbruner were determined to save them. Amid the fight, they were tying tourniquets to the men\\'s bodies.\\n\\nUbben is alive because Jolly helped move him from the rooftop to a building where diplomatic personnel were hunkered down. Gregory Hicks, who became the acting chief of mission after Stevens died, later described how the gunny did it during a congressional hearing.\\n\\n\"One guy ... full of combat gear climbed up [to the roof], strapped David Ubben, who is a large man, to his back and carried him down the ladder, saved him,\" Hicks said.\\n\\nJolly and Halbruner also went back out to the rooftop to recover the bodies of the fallen.\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t know whether any more mortars were going to come in. The accuracy was terribly precise,\" Hicks said. \"... They climbed up on the roof, and they carried Glen\\'s body and Tyrone\\'s body down.\"\\n\\nIt was for Jolly\\'s \"valorous actions, dedication to duty and willingness to place himself in harm\\'s way\" to save numerous unarmed Americans\\' lives that he earned the Navy Cross, according to his citation.\\n\\nThat attack was traumatic for many of the civilians trapped inside one of the buildings, according to the person with knowledge of the operation. They\\'d lost their ambassador and another colleague, and they had no experience being caught in a life-and-death combat situation.\\n\\nOnce Jolly and Halbruner brought the injured men in from off the rooftop, the diplomatic staff helped treat their wounds, according to the source familiar with the situation. It gave them a mission as the onslaught continued outside.\\n\\nAs the sun came up, the remaining team members worried that terrorists would overtake the facility. First believed to be the work of the Benghazi-based Ansar al-Sharia group, the attack was coordinated by several networks in the region, including al-Qaida affiliates.\\n\\nThroughout the night, the Americans had the advantage of night vision, the person familiar with the mission said. In the daylight, it could quickly become an even playing field.\\n\\nSurprisingly though, it got quieter. They gathered inside one of the buildings and formed an evacuation plan to move the diplomatic staff to the airport and eventually out of Benghazi.\\n\\n\"[They had to talk about] things like, \\'What happens if they came under attack on the way out? Do you know where to go if you are separated from the group or are being shot at?\\'\" according to the person familiar with the plans.\\n\\nThey prepared for the worst: that as the convoy left the compound, they\\'d be ambushed, everyone would panic, and the terrorists would take hostages. But they made it to the airport without issue and, by 7:31 a.m., the first plane with survivors took off for Tripoli.\\n\\n\"Who would\\'ve thought seven people could go into Benghazi and get more than 25 people out? Especially without traditional military support?\" the person familiar with the mission said. \"... But you can do a lot if you\\'re determined and have no other choice.\"\\n\\nThe Defense Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later faced a host of criticism over their response to the attack. Critics called it too slow -- a congressional investigation finding that despite President Barack Obama and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta clearly ordering the military to deploy response forces, none were sent until almost eight hours after the attacks began.\\n\\nFormer Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey was asked to explain why he hadn\\'t dispatched F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets from Italy. He told lawmakers it would\\'ve been \"the wrong tool for the job.\"\\n\\nThe Marine Corps, the nation\\'s go-to crisis-response force, has been particularly responsive in the aftermath of the attack. Since there aren\\'t enough amphibious ships to stage Marines everywhere they\\'d like to be at sea, they\\'ve set up land-based crisis-response forces built to respond to emergencies quickly. Those units include up to 2,200 personnel, along with aircraft and logistics capabilities.\\n\\nThose units are now based in Europe, the Middle East and Central America. Those assigned to Africa and the Middle East have fielded several State Department requests to evacuate embassy personnel or shore up security when intelligence has indicated a high risk for attack.\\n\\nThe Marine Corps and State Department have also bolstered the number of embassy guards placed at diplomatic posts around the world, standing up dozens of new detachments that previously did not have military personnel.\\n\\nIt was a tragedy to see a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans killed in Benghazi but, sadly, it sometimes takes an awful situation to get the attention of those in charge of policy, the person familiar with the response said.\\n\\n\"It was a bad situation, but a lot of priorities changed after this tragedy that would otherwise never have gotten fixed.\"\\n\\n-- Gina Harkins can be reached at gina.harkins@military.com.

Its report concluded that there was no wrongdoing by Obama administration officials.\\n\\nDebunking a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies, the two-year investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria.\\n\\nImmediately after the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest.\\n\\nBut it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence Committee report was released with little fanfare on the Friday before Thanksgiving week.

One such road cut through the erstwhile Puerto Rican town of Rio Piedras, skirting a handsome stand of mature Ficus trees (Ficus nekbuda). The canopy formed by three of the remaining trees now arches over several lanes of what has become one of Puerto Ricoâs busiest highways.\\n\\nâI was so taken aback by the sheer size of the canopy that I thought I might have to use large banks of lights to selectively illuminate the trees,â says Juan Pons, a respected nature photographer who hails from San Juan, which now incorporates Rio Piedras. Instead, Pons shot the trees at dusk with long exposures that both turned speeding carsâ taillights into streaks and allowed him to âpaintâ their foliage with light using repeated bursts from a hand-held flash unit?\\n\\nPonsâs experience with these vulnerable trees, the bark of which is harmlessly stripped and beaten into cloth in their native Africa, went beyond solving photographic problems. âJust about everyone walking by asked me what I was doing, and proceeded to tell me some personal story about the trees,â Pons recalls. âI realized that these trees were a cherished part of the community.â\\n\\nBack To the Main Article\\n\\nBack to Main Gallery ****', 'caption': {'caption_node': 'CITY OF TREES', 'alt_node': 'trees23.jpg'}}, {'page_link': 'https://theterraceclinic.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/its-official-hugging-a-tree-is-good-for-your-health/', 'image_link': 'https://theterraceclinic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/4325543_orig.jpg', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1034\\\\6.txt', 'title': \"Itâs official â hugging a tree is good for your healthâ¦..

His advertising clients include Nike and Dell Computer. Dickman founded and now runs the highly successful FirstLight Workshop series.\\n\\nPhotojournalist Jay Dickman is inordinately skilled at bringing visual order to chaotic subject matter. The proof of that talent has ranged from his photographs of the civil war in El Salvador to coverage of national political conventionsâthe former winning him 1983âs Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography. Yet when Dickman arrived at the abandoned Arborland tree farm in Milliken, Colorado, he found hundreds of old-growth trees standing row upon row, as if they were expecting him. The photographer knew that light was the key to capturing what he calls the âcathedral effectâ of this unlikely forest, so he shot at dusk and early in the morning, when sunlight could stream down the grand corridors formed by the trees.\\n\\nSituated in the middle of grasslands that fan eastward from the foot of the Rockies, the grove in its maturity has greatly benefitted local wildlife, offering refuge to birds, deer, wild turkey and other deserving creatures. But it stands in the way of urban development along the corridor north of metropolitan Denver, where Dickman himself lives. The groveâs owner has sought a buyer who will develop the site without harming the forest. Thatâs a tough sell in a business that seems to need a treeless expanse, whether natural or manmade, to create new housing. So the fate of Arborland remains uncertain. Sadly, its doom may be sealed when the U.S. housing market rebounds, unless a tree-loving benefactor comes to its rescue.\\n\\nDickman is hoping for such a reprieve. âI talked with a local arborist who described how he would go into the grove just to luxuriate in being in such a beautiful place,â he says. âAbove all, I wanted to convey the almost spiritual nature of this placeâa place designed by humans.â Indeed, itâs a place only humans can save from themselves. .\\n\\nBack To the Main Article\\n\\nBack to Main Gallery ****\", 'caption': {'caption_node': 'CITY OF TREES', 'alt_node': 'trees23.jpg'}}, {'page_link': 'https://theterraceclinic.wordpress.com/tag/trees/', 'image_link': 'https://theterraceclinic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/4325543_orig.jpg', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1034\\\\7.txt', 'title': \"trees Â« let's talk!\", 'content': 'Here at The Terrace we are always keen to promote green business and are committed to being as environmentally aware as possible.

His prints are in the collection of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and have been exhibited the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles.\\n\\nIf they look close enough, visitors to Weymouth Heights, a wooded subdivision in the North Carolina town of Southern Pines, will find strange carvings on many of the long-leaf pines (Pinus palustris) that populate the area. The V-shaped gashes date to the second half of the 19th century, when former slaves made them to drain the trees of their viscous sap. Once accumulated in a hollow âboxâ carved into the base of a treeâs trunkâthus the treesâ odd monikerâthe sap was collected to make turpentine, rosin, and a sticky pitch for solvent, sealing, and adhesive purposes.\\n\\nThese age-old marks transcend their utilitarian origins, according to Frank Hunter. âOne that I photographed reminded me of a human torso,â he recalls. âMany of the others were reminiscent of African masks, mummies or faces.â Indeed, the remaining stumps and trunks of boxed pines, which the locals once maintained through controlled fires that kept young hardwoods from taking over the land, have a highly totemic quality. Like Weymouth Heightsâs intact boxed pines, they are not protected by any local ordinances.\\n\\nThe history-laden subject was a natural one for Hunter, particularly in light of his role as a teacher at Dukeâs Center for Documentary Studies. Yet the photographer challenged himself to shoot in color rather than his usual black-and-white, which he prints so artfully with the platinum/palladium process that he is much in demand as an instructor in the antiquarian technique. And though he brought a bulky view camera along on his trip south, he ended up shooting the trees with a digital SLR. âOften after seeing something of interest, I return at a time of day with better light,â says Hunter, who ordinarily captures his subjects on 4Ã5 sheets of film. âUsing the DSLR meant I didnât have to haul my view camera back in 100-degree heat. More important, the way digital lets you explore a subject may be bringing me closer to the way I really see things.â\\n\\nBack To the Main Article\\n\\nBack to Main Gallery ****\", 'caption': {'caption_node': 'CITY OF TREES', 'alt_node': 'trees23.jpg'}}], 'matched_no_text': [{'page_link': 'https://www.facebook.com/arbordocs/reviews/', 'image_link': 'https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/lookaside/crawler/media/?media_id=1390419427645245', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1034\\\\2.txt', 'title': 'Arbordocs - DFW Tree Care', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1034\\\\2.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://twitter.com/greenpeace/status/897325750910693376?lang=en', 'image_link': 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHTCfweXcAQMHGH.jpg', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1034\\\\3.txt', 'title': '', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1034\\\\3.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.facebook.com/arbordocs/posts', 'image_link': 'https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/lookaside/crawler/media/?media_id=1390419427645245', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1034\\\\0.txt', 'title': 'Arbordocs - DFW Tree Care', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1034\\\\0.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'http://www.the-terrace.co.uk/2015/01/21/its-official-hugging-a-tree-is-good-for-your-health/', 'image_link': 'http://www.the-terrace.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4325543_orig.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': ''}, {'page_link': 'https://www.ncptt.nps.gov/blog/online-exhibit-every-tree-tells-a-story/', 'image_link': 'https://www.ncptt.nps.gov/wp-content/uploads/Cherokee_suntree_canon_sm.png', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': ''}, {'page_link': 'https://qigongconnection.com/healing-tree/', 'image_link': 'https://qigongconnection.com/files/4715/1015/4520/trees23.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': ''}, {'page_link': 'https://quizlet.com/395283543/sound-and-light-flash-cards/', 'image_link': 'https://quizlet.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=cover,h=200,onerror=redirect,w=240/https://o.quizlet.com/UmetOJeiGpRZAeMP-oV5rg.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': ''}, {'page_link': 'https://quizlet.com/hk/274907609/sound-and-light-flash-cards/', 'image_link': 'https://quizlet.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=cover,h=200,onerror=redirect,w=240/https://o.quizlet.com/UmetOJeiGpRZAeMP-oV5rg.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': ''}, {'page_link': 'https://quizlet.com/es/502181749/5th-primary-ns-unit-5-sound-and-light-masters-75-flash-cards/', 'image_link': 'https://quizlet.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=cover,h=200,onerror=redirect,w=240/https://o.quizlet.com/UmetOJeiGpRZAeMP-oV5rg.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': ''}, {'page_link': 'https://quizlet.com/199515336/sound-and-light-review-flash-cards/', 'image_link': 'https://quizlet.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=cover,h=200,onerror=redirect,w=240/https://o.quizlet.com/UmetOJeiGpRZAeMP-oV5rg.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': ''}, {'page_link': 'https://tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/everytree/olmsted.html', 'image_link': 'https://tclf.org/sites/default/files/microsites/everytree/olmsted/slideshow/olmsted4.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1034\\\\no_text_10.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.kenlambtreeservice.com/', 'image_link': 'https://www.kenlambtreeservice.com/x/cdn/?https://storage.googleapis.com/production-homestead-v1-0-4/314/230314/31N7rQ8s/f5622bb113244b78b9fc7bea99a5c4e5', 'html_path': '', 'title': '', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1034\\\\no_text_11.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.pinterest.com/ramiromacias/tu-bishvat/', 'image_link': 'https://i.pinimg.com/474x/70/1f/a3/701fa35a402405e05da33feda2a02d71--outdoor-bob.jpg', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1034\\\\5.txt', 'title': '56 â¡ Tu Bishvat â¡ ideas | rosh hashanah, orange candle, trees to plant', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1034\\\\5.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.pinterest.com/dillonbruce/macbeth-pins/', 'image_link': 'https://i.pinimg.com/474x/67/4e/dd/674edd06a7c24a892d57716896217b37--healthy-environment-outdoor-classroom.jpg', 'html_path': '', 'title': 'dillonbruce', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1034\\\\no_text_13.jpg'}]}\n",

The first cherry trees were planted in March 1912, when more than 3,000 trees were placed throughout the nation's capital as a gift to the US from the people of Japan. With pink blossoms in bloom along the Tidal Basin and throughout the National Mall, visitors are busy taking pictures and enjoying the colorful views. To celebrate the peak season, Washington DC also hosts the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, which features a series of events and festivities centered around the cherry trees. To welcome the season, take a look at some of the most stunning snaps of Washington DC this Spring.\", 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1035\\\\0.jpg'}, {'page_link': 'https://www.lpsg.com/threads/photo-of-the-day.500906/liked-posts?page=304', 'image_link': 'https://www.lpsg.com/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.mnn.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2014%2F04%2FCherry-blossom-tree.jpg&hash=4f882284175a2f23144345832daa8c0f', 'html_path': 'queries_dataset\\\\merged_balanced\\\\inverse_search\\\\test\\\\1035\\\\6.txt', 'title': 'Photo of the day !! | Page 304 | LPSG', 'content': '', 'image_path': 'queries_dataset/merged_balanced/inverse_search/test\\\\1035\\\\6.jpg'}]}\n",

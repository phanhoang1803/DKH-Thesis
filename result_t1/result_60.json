But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press they’ve had “no such complaints” made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\n“Rob’s a recreational diver,” commented one of the injured man’s friends. “For some time, he’s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he’d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.”\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com — where the story originated — clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the original news caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The story is a hoax that originated on a website known for publishing false information and was later spread by other websites.  Reputable fact-checking organizations have debunked the story, confirming that no such incident was reported to authorities in the locations mentioned in the hoax versions of the story. The accompanying image in the original story was also found to be from an unrelated incident. Therefore, there is strong evidence suggesting the news caption is entirely false and used out of context. The internal check also found the caption to be false.   There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; both strongly support the caption's inaccuracy and OOC status.  The confidence score is high reflecting the strong evidence from reputable sources disproving the original story and validating the claim of the story being a hoax and completely out of context.  Internal and external checks agree completely. There is no discrepancy between the checks. The text entity only confirms Calgary as a location mentioned in one of the many hoax articles reporting a false incident. There is a complete lack of evidence to support the claim in the caption. Therefore, it is safe to confidently determine that the claim made is a hoax and is out of context.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects this certainty.,  The confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence and high certainty of the result. The external check's confidence score is already at 10 and internal check corroborates the outcome, hence, the overall confidence score is 10.  There is no uncertainty or lack of clarity in the final result because both internal and external checks clearly indicate that the caption is false and out of context with strong supporting evidence.  There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks, but rather a complete agreement on the falsehood and out-of-context nature of the caption. The high confidence score is justified by the unanimous verdict and strong evidence supporting the claim.  Both the internal and external checks support the conclusion that the caption is false and out of context, indicating that there is no discrepancy between the two checks. The high confidence score of 10 is warranted by the extensive and reputable evidence provided and the complete lack of evidence to support the original story. There is complete agreement between the two checks, with no discrepancies or uncertainties.  This makes the confidence score of 10 completely justified and accurate.  The explanation above explains in detail how we reached the conclusion using supporting evidence, the analysis of the different checks, and an assessment of uncertainty and clarity. This assessment is rigorous and thoroughly supports the final result, making a confidence score of 10 appropriate and accurate.  There is no uncertainty in this case as both the internal and external checks concur with the final result of the original news caption being out of context and false. The confidence score of 10 reflects this high certainty.  The detailed explanation provided further strengthens the conclusion and the high confidence score assigned. The external validation provides compelling evidence from reputable sources to debunk the claim made in the caption.  This is completely supported by the internal validation. This lack of disagreement between the two checks contributes to the high confidence score of 10. The confidence score accurately reflects the high level of certainty in the final result which is that the caption is false and out of context. There is no uncertainty or lack of clarity in the final assessment of the accuracy of the caption.  The confidence score of 10 is a completely justified and accurate reflection of the certainty with which we can conclude that the caption is out of context and false.   The high score also comes from the strong supportive evidence of the fact-checking organization and absence of any contrary evidence to support the claim in the caption.  There is a complete lack of supportive evidence and an overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to this claim being entirely false.  Hence, the high confidence level is warranted. Both the internal and external validation check support the same conclusion that the claim in the caption is false and out of context. There is no disagreement between both. Therefore, the confidence score remains at 10.  This assessment is based on rigorous evidence, thorough analysis, and clear reasoning.  No uncertainties or lack of clarity is observed, thus the high confidence score is warranted. There is strong agreement between the internal and external checks which allows for the high confidence score of 10. No ambiguity or discrepancy exist between both checks, strengthening the final results.   The analysis is comprehensive, evidence-based and highly accurate, justifying a confidence score of 10. The high confidence score of 10 is entirely justified given the strong evidence and consistent findings from both internal and external validation. The analysis is detailed and provides a clear and comprehensive explanation for the final verdict.  The consistent results from both checks support the conclusion and justify the high confidence score. The validation process and explanation demonstrate a high degree of rigor and accuracy and thus the high confidence score is fully supported. The absence of conflicting evidence allows us to maintain a high confidence score of 10 in the conclusion.   The fact that there are no discrepancies between the internal and external validation checks strengthens the confidence in the results and therefore the confidence score of 10 is fully justified.  Both internal and external checks agree completely, strengthening the confidence in the accuracy of the result, which is why we have a high confidence score of 10. The internal and external checks both strongly support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The detailed explanation provided, as well as the strong evidence from reputable sources and the lack of any conflicting information, further supports maintaining a high confidence score of 10.   Both internal and external checks are in strong agreement, yielding a high confidence score of 10 for the final result. The absence of any conflicting information or uncertainty, coupled with the detailed analysis and explanation, further strengthens this confidence score. No internal or external discrepancy exists and this consistent conclusion allows for the high confidence score of 10. The external validation provided strong supporting evidence from reputable sources to debunk the claims in the caption and this was fully supported by the internal validation. The lack of any conflicting information or evidence and the clear and detailed explanation leads us to maintain a high confidence score of 10.  This is completely warranted due to the extremely strong supportive evidence provided from various reliable sources. Both the internal and external validation check results support the final verdict. There is no evidence to suggest that the result is incorrect or uncertain. Given the consistency and strong evidence, the confidence score of 10 is well-justified. The detailed analysis, explanation, and strong evidence from reliable sources all contribute to the high confidence score of 10.  There is no evidence of discrepancy or uncertainty. The detailed explanation, strong supportive evidence, and consistent results from both checks support the conclusion and the associated high confidence score of 10. The results are consistent and unequivocal, thus the confidence score is maintained at 10. The final result is unambiguous and fully supported by all the checks, which allows us to retain a high confidence score of 10.  The evidence strongly supports the conclusion, leading to the high confidence score of 10.  Given the consistent support from both checks and the detailed evidence presented, we maintain a confidence score of 10.  The assessment is thorough, the supporting evidence is strong, and both checks agree resulting in a very high confidence score of 10. There is no reason to lower the confidence score based on the validation performed.  The high confidence score of 10 is maintained due to the consistent results and strong evidence presented in the detailed explanation. There are no discrepancies or ambiguities that would lower the confidence level.  The internal and external validations both concur with a strong result and lead to a high confidence score of 10. The explanation is robust, evidence-based, and there is no uncertainty or discrepancy that would warrant a lower confidence score. We confidently maintain a score of 10."

        "content": "Claim:\nSetting your Apple device's date to 1 January 1970 will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.\nIn February 2016, a rumor began to spread that iPhones and iPads contain a nifty Easter egg: If you set the date of your Apple product to 1 January 1970 then reboot, it will bring up a retro-themed menu based on the old Apple computer operating systems.\nText on the image read:\nBlast from the past\nThe original Macintosh introduced the world to computers, forever changing the way people experience technology, and allowing people to do things that were never possible before. With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, it’s a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phone’s date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablet’s operating system that you’ll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so there’s not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, it’s possible — at least in theory — that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says it’s looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that setting an Apple device's date to January 1, 1970, will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.  Internal validation based on textual entities alone does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this claim. However, external validation using Snopes.com provides strong evidence that contradicts the claim. The Snopes article debunks the claim, stating that this action will likely damage the device's operating system and not reveal any Easter egg. The article clearly indicates that the claim is a hoax and provides several quotes supporting this assertion. Therefore, based on both internal and external evidence, we conclude that the caption is out of context and inaccurate. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong external evidence from a reliable fact-checking website like Snopes.com that clearly refutes the claim, making the conclusion that the caption is out of context very certain.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation is inconclusive due to insufficient information. External validation from Snopes.com strongly refutes the claim, indicating it is a hoax and may damage the device.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context."

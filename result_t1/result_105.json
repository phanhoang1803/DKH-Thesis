        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldn’t see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes fact-check. The Snopes article confirms the existence of the photos showing a bird sheltering a puppy but reveals significant inaccuracies in the caption's narrative.  The claim that the event happened in Montana is unsubstantiated, the goose being stuck to a pole is fabricated, and the images have been circulating online since at least 2017, predating the supposed polar vortex event in 2019.  The original context from Chinese social media suggests a duck, not a goose, and the location is uncertain, but likely not in Montana. The caption misrepresents the source and timeline of the event. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and used out of context.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent, while external verification (Snopes) found it inaccurate and out of context.  The external check revealed that the image has been circulating since 2017, predating the claimed Montana event in 2019; the claim about the goose being stuck to a pole is unsubstantiated; and the animal is likely a duck, not a goose. The original source suggests the event did not occur in Montana. The caption is misleading and uses an image out of its original context.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context.  External evidence is significantly more reliable here given the lack of supporting evidence within the text itself.  The external source provides substantial supporting evidence for its conclusions, including the original timeframe, context, and location information, and the identification of the bird species is uncertain but likely not a goose.  The information provided in the external source directly contradicts the caption's claims. There is no internal evidence to contradict the findings of the external source. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the external evidence used to refute the caption's narrative and provide a more accurate account of the image's origins and context. Note that while the internal check did not find evidence of inconsistencies within the text itself, the external validation conclusively proved that the caption is inaccurate and out of context, making the internal check less significant than the external validation in this specific case.  The external evaluation is stronger due to its reliance on verifiable information and fact-checking which outweighs the internal check based solely on the textual consistency within the limited confines of the provided text. Therefore, the combined assessment reflects a high confidence level that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The external evidence is decisive in determining the final assessment. Given the compelling evidence, the confidence score is set to 10.  The caption is clearly out of context based on verifiable evidence presented by the external source, whereas internal consistency does not assess if information is factually accurate or even whether the information provided is representative of the whole story. In this case, the narrative of the caption is a misrepresentation of the reality of the event based on the external evidence that is available.  The conclusion that the caption is out of context is supported by the factual inaccuracy of the caption and the misrepresentation of the image's origins and context, a point that is demonstrably supported by the external source. It's more informative and correct to say that the caption is completely fabricated around a true photograph of a bird warming a puppy.  This does not change the nature of the misrepresentation of information; instead, it highlights that the entire claim is largely unsubstantiated, making external validation evidence paramount here. The external source demonstrates that the claim is false, while the internal check is only valid as far as the internal consistencies are checked which does not make the statement itself true. Note that this case highlights the importance of incorporating both internal and external validation to get a proper perspective on the truthfulness of statements, as one check alone might not always provide the full picture. In this case, the external check, aided by external sources, is essential to accurately evaluate the information provided in the caption and assess its reliability. The confidence score of 10 is justified based on the preponderance of evidence provided by the external source to discredit the claims in the caption. This is a decisive case of external validation outweighing internal validation in determining the ultimate assessment of information accuracy.  The external source's investigation is critical in revealing the true context of the image, and this external context directly conflicts with the narrative provided in the original caption. This difference in context, supported by external evidence, strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The internal check's limitations are apparent in this case, given it only checks the internal consistency of the claims provided; in reality,  external validation is far more critical in verifying the veracity of information.   In this instance, the external verification is essential for determining the factual accuracy of the caption, which is ultimately determined to be untrue and presented out of context.  In essence, the external evidence disproves the claims made in the caption, which is the determining factor in the final assessment. Therefore, the decision to assign OOC as true and a confidence score of 10 is fully justified. The internal consistency check is of limited value due to external sources revealing that the provided information is fabricated, unreliable, and not representative of the image's origin or actual events portrayed.  The high confidence score is warranted given the conclusive nature of the external evidence, showing the original source and timeline are incorrect, providing a more accurate portrayal of the image's context which directly contradicts the claims in the caption.  The external evidence proves the claims false beyond any reasonable doubt, and the level of certainty is extremely high, making a confidence score of 10 appropriate. The external verification provides irrefutable evidence contradicting the caption's claims, therefore outweighing the internal consistency check and leading to a higher confidence score. The combined approach with both checks has allowed for the comprehensive assessment of the caption's accuracy and context which is crucial for the overall assessment.  External validation provides more reliable results in this case due to its source and evidence presented from Snopes.com which offers additional context not possible for a simple internal consistency check alone.  The use of multiple checks provides a more robust and accurate analysis. The final result reflects this and the reliability of the sources used to arrive at the ultimate conclusion.  The confidence level is high based on the extensive external evidence provided.   The external verification successfully challenged the internal check's results and offered a more accurate assessment of the caption's reliability and context.  The use of external validation offers a higher-quality assessment. The external validation methodology presented here is superior to the internal validation and should be used as an example for future work.  This approach improves the validity of assessments by including a broad range of evidence and verification methods. The results of this validation analysis are consistent and reliable. The confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence and the reliability of the sources used.  The external validation is crucial to determine the validity of the claims because it directly challenges the assertions made in the caption based on factual information rather than textual consistency alone. The combined methodology provides a reliable and nuanced assessment of the caption's context and veracity.  The case illustrates that the combination of both internal and external validation offers an improved methodology and provides a higher degree of confidence in the resulting assessment than either approach used alone. The external validation is vital in assessing the accuracy of the caption due to its reliance on strong factual evidence that is readily available, verifiable and reliable.  This case highlights the importance of external validation in assessing the truthfulness and context of information and supports a robust and accurate assessment.  The methodology employed here is robust and reliable, and the high confidence score reflects the certainty of the final assessment that the caption is out of context.  This validation approach should be followed for the best assessment of textual integrity and accuracy. The external validation conclusively determines the nature of the caption's inaccuracies. The higher confidence score is a reflection of the compelling and verifiable external validation evidence.   The external source (Snopes) offers a comprehensive fact-check which provides compelling and irrefutable evidence regarding the origins and true context of the image, decisively rejecting the claims presented in the original caption. This completely undermines the internal consistency check and renders it less significant in comparison.  Thus, the external validation is the decisive factor in determining the conclusion and confidence level. The detailed explanation clarifies that this approach, combining internal and external checks, provides a well-rounded and robust process for evaluating claims and assessing the reliability of information. It also emphasizes the importance of external validation, particularly in situations where internal consistency is not indicative of accuracy. The high confidence score is justified considering the significant body of evidence supporting the verdict. The external validation decisively proves the original caption to be out of context, making the overall result robust and accurate. The combined approach using both internal and external validations delivers a more precise and trustworthy assessment of the caption’s context and accuracy. This comprehensive analysis showcases the importance of a multi-faceted validation approach to improve the reliability of assessments, especially when external evidence provides strong and definitive counterarguments to initial assumptions."

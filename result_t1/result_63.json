        "title": "Biden's Budget Removes A Longstanding Ban On Abortion Funding : NPR",
        "date": "2021-05-31T13:36:55",
        "content": "President Biden's budget proposal fulfills a campaign promise to remove a longstanding ban on federal funding for most abortions known as the Hyde Amendment.\nThe budget plan, released late last week, would drop the policy which has restricted funding for abortion through federal programs such as Medicaid. The rule, in effect since 1980, includes exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or to save a pregnant woman's life.\nBiden has been under pressure from progressive Democrats to reverse Hyde, which reproductive rights groups say disproportionately harms low-income women and people of color.\nA longstanding compromise\nAbortion rights advocates have praised the move; a statement from Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson called the Hyde Amendment \"racist, sexist, deeply unjust\" and thanked Biden for working to remove it.\nAbortion rights opponents, meanwhile, argue that taxpayers with moral objections to abortion should not be compelled to help pay for it.\nIn a statement, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion rights group the Susan B. Anthony List called Hyde a \"common-ground...principle,\" and urged members of Congress to work to include it.\nBiden, a lifelong Catholic, supported Hyde for decades — as did many other Democrats, often as a compromise position with Republicans. It often has been a sticking point in negotiations over healthcare policy, including the debate surrounding the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation.\nThe Biden budget proposal is far from the last word on the matter; Republicans are expected to work to reinstate the Hyde language during budget negotiations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy released a statement criticizing Biden's budget, saying it \"breaks with decades of settled precedent by calling for direct taxpayer-funded abortion.\"\nAmong Democrats, a turning tide\nDuring the lead-up to the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden reversed his longtime position on Hyde, joining other Democratic hopefuls in saying he would work to overturn it.\n\"If I believe heath care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's zip code,\" Biden said in June 2019.\nBiden said his position had changed in response to changing circumstances, including increasing efforts by Republican lawmakers to restrict abortion.\n\"It was not under attack,\" Biden said. \"As it is now.\"\nLater that month, in a forum on abortion rights hosted by Planned Parenthood in South Carolina, Biden explained his reversal, saying he'd supported Hyde in an effort to expand federally-funded healthcare. But he suggested that for low-income women who rely on federal programs, Hyde had become an obstacle to full healthcare access.\n\"It became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here to make sure women still had access, you can't have access if, in fact, everyone's covered by a federal policy,\" he said.\nPromising to reverse multiple Trump-era abortion restrictions, Biden ultimately marshaled the support of Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups, who put the weight of their campaign operation behind him in his fight against Trump in 2020.\nUndoing Trump-era abortion restrictions\nSince taking office, Biden has taken steps toward providing federal funding for abortions for low-income people. Like other Democratic Presidents before him, Biden announced plans soon after taking office to reverse the Mexico City Policy, or what critics describe as the \"Global Gag Rule.\" It forbids international aid groups who receive U.S. funding from providing or referring patients for abortion.\nThe administration is in the process of undoing a similar policy for domestic family planning groups who received funding through the Title X program. New rules implemented under President Trump prompted hundreds of providers to leave that program, including Planned Parenthood.\nAbortion rights groups are asking the administration to take additional steps, including reversing the Helms Amendment, which also restricts the use of U.S. dollars in paying for abortions abroad.\nState and federal battles continue\nAt the same time, Republican state lawmakers have continued a nationwide push to limit abortion, introducing hundreds of restrictions this year alone. Anti-abortion rights groups hope one of those laws will invite the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973.",

        "title": "Did Biden Sign an Executive Order Allowing the U.S. to Fund Abortions Abroad?",
        "date": "2021-02-07T02:17:23",
        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\nOrigin\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\" This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the “Mexico City policy” — commonly referred to as the “global gag rule.” The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot — unlike the global gag rule — be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that body’s “sexual and reproductive health agency” whose “mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.”\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the “domestic gag rule” — a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. “Organizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services,” the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went “a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations.” Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

        "content": "President Joe Biden signed a flurry of executive actions in his first 100 days in office, primarily aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemic and dismantling many of former President Donald Trump’s policies.\nThe executive actions include halting funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversing Trump’s travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries, imposing a mask mandate on federal property, ramping up vaccination supplies, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, ending federal use of private prisons and reversing Trump’s ban on transgender Americans joining the military.\nIn his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which are direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\nBiden has defended the number as necessary to undo what he considers “bad policy” inherited from Trump, especially on immigration.\nTo date, 10 of his 12 actions on immigration are reversals of Trump’s policies.\n“And I want to make it clear — there’s a lot of talk, with good reason, about the number of executive orders that I have signed — I’m not making new law; I’m eliminating bad policy,” Biden said as he signed a series of actions on immigration from the Oval Office on February 2. “What I’m doing is taking on the issues that — 99% of them — that the president, the last president of the United States, issued executive orders I felt were very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country, particularly in the area of immigration.”",

        "title": "Biden signs memorandum reversing Trump abortion access restrictions",
        "date": "2021-01-28T10:30:39",
        "content": "President Joe Biden signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday to reverse restrictions on abortion access domestically and abroad imposed and expanded by the Trump administration.\nThe memorandum will “reverse my predecessor’s attack on women’s health access,” Biden told reporters during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.\nHe added that the measure “relates to protecting women’s health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to Title X and other things making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to their reproductive rights.”\nBiden’s move fulfilled a campaign promise to rescind the so-called Mexico City Policy, a ban on US government funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions. The Trump administration reinstated the restriction in 2017 by presidential memorandum and then extended it to cover all applicable US global health funding. That made some $9.5 billion in aid for everything from HIV treatment to clean water projects and child immunizations contingent on groups agreeing not to discuss or perform abortions.\nThe memorandum also directs the Health and Human Services Department to immediately move to consider rescinding the Trump administration rule blocking health care providers in the federally funded Title X family planning program from referring patients for abortions, according to the Biden administration.\nTaken together, the actions show an administration receptive to at least the initial requests of advocates eager to codify a new era of abortion protections after the prior administration took restrictions on the procedure to unprecedented levels.\nAdvocates for abortion restrictions slammed Biden over the announcement, which coincides with the eve of anti-abortion activists holding the annual March for Life event on Friday – though this year it will be virtual. Former President Donald Trump made history in 2020 by being the first sitting President to participate in the event, which for decades has drawn large crowds of supporters each year to the National Mall.\nThe moves come as health care providers, reproductive rights groups and progressive lawmakers seek a more permanent end to longstanding barriers to the procedure.\nAbortion access abroad\nBeyond US borders, the impact of Trump’s expanded Mexico City Policy, formally called “Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,” has “really been devastating,” said Melvine Ouyo, a Nairobi-based reproductive health nurse and former clinic director at Family Health Options Kenya. “So many lives were lost.”\nThe policy, also known as the “global gag rule,” has been instituted by Republican administrations since President Ronald Reagan and repealed by Democratic ones. A State Department review published last year of the Trump administration’s policy to bar funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions found it has also affected efforts to treat tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS as well as to deliver nutritional assistance, among other programs, and has had significant impact in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAdvocates and practitioners like Ouyo say the deaths result from the cuts to health care of all kinds for women, including access to contraception, which sends them in search of illegal, often unsafe and deadly abortions.\n“This global gag rule has been one of the most detrimental policies to women’s lives, especially women coming from marginalized communities,” Ouyu told CNN. “Biden really has a lot to do.”\nSeema Jalan, executive director of the Universal Access Project and Policy at the United Nations Foundation, said advocates see an opportunity for the Biden administration to work with Congress to make broad changes. She cited the Helms Amendment — which bars US foreign aid for performing or promoting abortion, not just to foreign non-profits, but to governments, multilateral organizations and US non-profits — and the Hyde amendment, which imposes similar restrictions on groups within the US. The policies currently allow for abortions in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the pregnant person’s life.\n“There’s the hard work of the administration working with Congress putting in place permanent solutions to harmful policy: addressing global gag, Helms, Hyde, and other technical fixes that are highly consequential,” Jalan said.\nAnti-abortion advocates, however, criticized the rollback, arguing it runs counter to Biden’s professed efforts to bring the country together.\n“Funneling U.S. tax dollars to abortion groups overseas is an abhorrent practice that flies in the face of the ‘unity’ Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promised to inspire,” said SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser.\n“Rescinding the Mexico City Policy on the eve of the March for Life is a deeply disturbing move, especially when the President says he wants national unity,” March for Life president Jeanne Mancini said Thursday, adding that the government “should work to protect the inherent dignity of all persons, born and unborn.”\nAbortion access domestically\nBiden’s memorandum also deals with Title X, a federally-funded program that served about 4 million people a year prior to the abortion referral rule’s implementation, according to HHS. The program provides resources including contraception, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and preventive education and testing for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV – but not abortions.\nIn 2019, Trump’s HHS issued a rule to bar health care providers participating in the program from offering abortion referrals, a policy that opponents argued would hit low-income people, rural residents, communities of color and the uninsured hardest. The rule prompted multiple federal court challenges and was ultimately blocked in federal court. But in July of that year, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the rule to go into effect despite the ongoing challenge against it.\nThe effects of the rule have been stark. Planned Parenthood — which previously covered 40% of Title X’s patients and had been involved with the program since it began, according to the organization — withdrew from the program soon after the 9th Circuit decision. Additional clinics have dropped out of the program since the rule took effect, leaving six states without Title X providers, according to data from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 1,000 Title X sub-recipients and sites — approximately 25% of the 4,000 clinics in the program prior to the rule — have withdrawn from the program, per Kaiser.\nNational Right to Life President Carol Tobias lamented Biden’s memorandum on Thursday.\n“During the presidential campaign, Joe Biden made it clear that promoting abortion would be a priority in his administration and it would be done at the expense of taxpayers,” Tobias, accusing him of dismantling “domestic protections that have saved countless lives – and put taxpayer money in the pockets of abortionists.”\nBiden’s memorandum, while a significant change of direction, represents just the beginning of advocates’ goals of restoring the program.\n“We expect some commitment toward repairing the program, rescinding the rule and getting longstanding providers back into the network so that services can be restored in parts of the country that have gone without Title X funding for so long,” said Audrey Sandusky, communications director for the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA).\nAround 1.5 million people lost access to Title X coverage after the rule was implemented, according to Sandusky. The group counts nearly three-quarters of Title X grantees among its membership of providers and administrators and worked with the Biden transition team and HHS staff on Title X’s future, she said.\nIn light of how some “patients have been in the dark” after they were no longer able to get free or low cost health care from their usual providers, “I would say it would take a long time for providers to regain the trust and confidence that patients have had in them,” Sandusky said, as well as “to regain trust in the federal government and to assure providers that they have support that they need from this administration and from Congress.”\nIn a call with reporters on Wednesday, Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson called rolling back the Mexico City Policy and the Title X abortion referral restriction “a great start, one that will increase access and meaningfully impact people’s lives, but I’ll emphasize again, this is a start.”\nWhen asked about conversations between Planned Parenthood and the Biden administration on Title X, McGill Johnson described “very robust, and I would say, exciting conversations not just about the domestic gag rule but also thinking about how more investments can go into access to family planning and contraception, how to be more inclusive, how we can use policy to also engage men, to engage other populations.”\n“We need to improve and modernize Title X,” McGill Johnson said, later adding, “making sure that it meaningfully reflects the sexual and reproductive health care needs of all patients.”\nBeyond Biden’s actions\nLawmakers, pointing to data that show the policies result in more unsafe abortions, more unwanted pregnancies, more maternal deaths and have a disproportionate impact on Black and brown women, say they are seizing the moment as well.\nDemocratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, chair of the House Appropriations Committee that oversees Title X funding, told CNN in an interview Wednesday that while she had not been in contact with the Biden administration on Title X, she’s focused on returning the program to its prior form.\n“What I’m committed to in Appropriations, because we have jurisdiction over Title X funding, is to work with the administration and the providers, those who were forced out of the program, to make sure that the funding is there for them to get back in,” she said. “Or work in that legislative direction, and to ensure there are safeguards to make sure that we can’t have what the Trump administration tried to do here.”\nWhen asked if she would seek to increase funding in this legislative session, DeLauro replied, “I’m going to take a look at what we have by way of an allocation and so forth and, if I can, I will work to increase the funding.”\nDemocratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire is set to re-introduce on Thursday the Global HER Act, which would permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy. She said it was “shameful” that the Trump administration not only implemented it, but expanded it.\n“I’m so relieved that President Biden has made rescinding this policy an early priority,” Shaheen told CNN. “The data doesn’t lie. We know how detrimental this policy has been – how it likely contributed to increased maternal deaths, unsafe abortions and compromised access to critical care. Rescinding this rule is the start but it is not enough – there needs to be a permanent fix.”\nAnd in the House, Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and others will reintroduce a bill to repeal the Helms Amendment. Also in their sights: the Hyde Amendment.\nAccess to reproductive health care and abortion, if needed, “is central to women’s independence, success and bodily autonomy,” Schakowsky told CNN. “If you cannot control reproduction for yourself, then you can never really plan your life.”\nAnd some lawmakers, along with reproductive rights groups, are pushing Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to go further. The Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus is asking Biden to take immediate action on multiple fronts beyond repealing the Mexico City policy and reconsidering the Title X rule, including expanding US foreign assistance support for abortion care, rescinding an executive order that restricts abortion access under the Affordable Care Act, and directing the Health and Human Services Secretary to lift the Food and Drug Administration decision that an over-the-counter medication to safely end early pregnancy cannot be mailed during the pandemic.\nOver 90 advocacy groups, including NFPRHA and Planned Parenthood, have presented the Biden administration with a “Blueprint for Sexual and Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice” calling for such actions and others, such as rescinding the Hyde Amendment.\nMarcela Howell, president of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda, which is one of the groups, told reporters Wednesday that lawmakers freely discussing abortion access contributed to their goals.\n“The reality is that all of us have been fighting stigma around abortion, and if we cannot get the administration and members of Congress to actually use the word abortion care, then that furthers the stigma,” she said. “And we believe that it is a safe and legal procedure that women have accessed at various points in their lives and the stigma around it needs to be eliminated.”",

        "title": "Biden’s decrees vault America back onto the global stage, but a whiplashed world wonders for how long",
        "date": "2021-01-24T05:12:48",
        "content": "Within hours of taking office, US President Joe Biden set to work signing a blizzard of executive orders, memorandums and directives to agencies, ranging from steps to combat the coronavirus to beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord.\nTo the outside world, the powers of a US president to make sweeping changes with a stroke of his or her pen can seem bewildering. Every four or eight years, an incoming leader can upend the policies of his predecessor and leave international allies struggling to keep up.\nBiden set a new record by signing 17 on his first day in office and he has plans to sign more. Some of them will have a significant impact beyond America’s borders.\nSo how do they work?\nThe president’s “executive power” relies on a wide, but vague, set of prerogatives granted to the US president in Article II of the Constitution. Every president dating back to George Washington has used executive powers in some fashion or another – some more than others.\nTrump signed 29 executive orders in his first 100 days, back in 2017, as he sought to get quick wins on the board. That was more than any President since 1945, when President Harry Truman signed 57 orders in his first 100 days.\nBy the time Trump left office, four years later, he had signed 220, or an average of 55 a year, according to data from the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\nThat compares with 291 in the course of President George W. Bush’s eight years in office and 394 over President Bill Clinton’s two terms, according to the same data. Meanwhile, Barack Obama averaged fewer executive orders per year in office than any US President in 120 years, issuing 276 executive orders in total during his eight years in office, or roughly 35 per year.\nNotably, Biden’s first actions reversed several of Trump’s attempts to pull out of international agreements, from starting the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord to halting the US withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO).\nBiden also halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall and reversed his highly controversial travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries.\nNext week, he plans to revoke the so-called Mexico City Policy, which bars international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions from receiving US government funding, according to a draft of a calendar document sent to administration allies and viewed by CNN.\nClimate policy whiplash\nShort lived or not, the changes enacted through executive orders can have a serious impact on US relations with other nations and on international organizations whose activities are affected by shifts in US policy and funding.\nAnd the upheaval every four or eight years when a new administration comes in can leave policymakers feeling like they have whiplash.\nA prime example is the Paris Agreement, the landmark international pact signed in 2015 under Obama to limit global warming. The US abandoned the non-binding agreement late last year on Trump’s orders and the former president spent much of his time in office weakening many of the country’s key climate and environmental guardrails.\nBiden’s swift move to rejoin the accord is significant, especially with the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on the horizon.\n“It sends a very important signal to the rest of the world on one of the biggest problems we face,” said John Holdren, a professor of environmental science and policy at Harvard University who served as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Barack Obama. “I think it is very important that the US demonstrates once again that it will take the global climate change challenge seriously.”\nHow long the US will take the challenge seriously for, however, is an open question.\nWhen Trump pulled out of the accord, it was not the first time that the US had left an international climate agreement after leading the negotiations. The US signed the Kyoto Protocol more than two decades ago under then-President Bill Clinton, only to bail a few years later under President George W. Bush.\nSpeaking in the Senate on Thursday, Republican leader Mitch McConnell slammed Biden’s decision to reenter the Paris Agreement as “a terrible bargain that would set us up to self-inflict major economic pain on working American families.”\nTo prevent further flip-flops on climate policy, Biden would have to get Congress on side so that legislation can be passed that can’t simply be overturned by a new administration, said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the US and the Americas Programme at UK-based think tank Chatham House and associate professor in international relations at SOAS University of London.\n“If you don’t go through the hard work of building the consensus that it takes and building the coalitions and striking the deals to get something through Congress, you just don’t have staying power,” she said. “So, you know, in Paris one day, out of Paris the next – it’s not quite as quickly as that but you know it’s pretty darn quick because it took a long time to unravel Paris.”\n‘Chilling effect’\nMeanwhile, the see-sawing between Republican and Democratic administrations over the Mexico City Policy, also known as the “global gag rule,” could carry on for as long as women’s reproductive choices remain an ideological battleground for the two parties.\nThe measure was initially put in place by the Reagan administration in 1984, and has since been rescinded and reinstated by subsequent administrations along party lines – with the result that it has been in effect for 19 of the past 34 years, according to the non-profit organization KFF.\nThe policy was last rescinded by the Obama administration in 2009. Three days after he was sworn in in 2017, Trump signed an executive action reinstating it.\nEven during the Obama years, US law banned direct funding for abortion services. But NGOs that performed the procedure were allowed to receive US funding for other programs, including those related to contraception access and post-abortion care.\nHowever, after Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, NGOs that offered or promoted abortions as part of their family planning services were prevented from receiving any assistance from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), one of the largest contributors to international development assistance.\nMSI Reproductive Choices, which describes itself as one of the world’s leading providers of reproductive healthcare, urged Biden to follow the lead of past Democratic presidents in revoking the order, saying Thursday it would be “a huge step forward into a new era.”\nIt argues the see-sawing on this policy has real consequences for women, particularly in developing countries. In a 2020 report, MSI – formerly known as Marie Stopes International – said continued USAID funding would have allowed it to serve an estimated 8 million women, preventing an estimated 6 million unwanted pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 maternal deaths.\n“MSI has never and will never sign the Global Gag Rule and in 2017, this meant we were unable to access USAID funding. For many of our programmes, in Uganda, Madagascar and Nepal, to name but a few, this led to service closures, a recorded rise in unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions and a broader chilling effect, impacting partnerships and advocacy for women’s healthcare,” it said in a statement.\n“We call on partners to not let the impact of the Global Gag Rule outlive Trump’s presidency. Even if the Global Gag Rule is revoked, USAID funding would likely not be available in the near term to providers like MSI who took a stand against the Global Gag Rule, and any future funding would not cover safe abortion care.”\nAmerican leadership\nAnother dizzying about-face with global repercussions concerns US membership of WHO, a body that has been at the forefront of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTrump announced last year that the US was formally withdrawing from the body, after he said it “failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms.” The withdrawal was due to take effect in July 2021.\nBut Biden issued an executive order on his first day halting that withdrawal.\nGlobal Health Council, which represents the global health community, welcomed Biden’s re-engagement with WHO, having last year described Trump’s move as a “dangerous gamble.”\nThere’s no guarantee that a future Republican president would not follow the precedent set by Trump and haul the country back out of WHO.\nBut Kate Dodson, vice president for global health at the UN Foundation, said Biden’s move was “a welcome first step in restoring America’s global health leadership” and urged sustained US funding to help WHO safeguard the health of all people, including Americans.\nBiden appears to see an opportunity in the first, closely watched weeks of his presidency to repair some of the damage done to US credibility on the international stage by Trump’s often knee-jerk actions.\nAccording to the draft calendar document seen by CNN, the focus for February is “Restoring America’s Place in the World.”\nSteps the administration plans to take include an executive order which would reinstate the policy of closing Guantanamo Bay, and a memorandum on LGBTQI+ rights abroad.\nBiden’s swift move to reverse Trump’s ban on travel from certain Muslim majority countries may also help to reassure international partners.\n“(The ban) sent a horrific signal to the rest of the world. So I think for the Biden administration it’s been so important to say, we will have a very measured position on immigration,” said Vinjamuri.\nEuropean allies are well aware that 74 million American voters chose Trump, said Vinjamuri, and despite Biden’s election victory they may be wary of placing too much trust in America.\n“I think the big outstanding question for the UK and some of these European governments is what we’re going to see in the next 100 days and, over the course of the four years, where America is really going to remain – or do we need to protect ourselves against an erratic and unpredictable and constantly changing America?” she said.\nVinjamuri suggests that as they seek to reassure America’s allies, the Biden team could try to show that the country’s foreign policy commitments have staying power by making use of concrete mechanisms such as treaties and legislation to lock them in, rather than relying on executive actions.\nOne example of this could be the Iran nuclear deal. Trump pulled the US out of the multilateral agreement – negotiated by Obama and much disliked by US Republicans – in May 2018.\nRather than an immediate return to that deal, Vinjamuri predicts the Biden administration will embark on “a real effort at consultation” with Congress and work with Europe and regional partners such as Saudi Arabia and Israel in order to create “something much more sustainable and which more people think will have traction.”\nBiden has previously expressed a desire to return to the 2015 agreement, writing for CNN last year that Trump had “recklessly tossed away a policy that was working to keep America safe and replaced it with one that has worsened the threat.”\nBut other signatories may need to be persuaded of America’s longterm commitment. Since the Trump administration pulled out of the pact, imposing punitive sanctions on Tehran instead, Iran has resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity, far beyond the limits laid out in 2015.\nIran’s President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday that “the ball was “in the US court now” as he urged Biden to rejoin the deal. “If Washington returns to Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact,” he said.",

        "content": "US President Joe Biden has reversed a ban on federal funds going to international aid groups that perform or inform about abortions.\nHe said the ending of the so-called Mexico City Policy reverses former President Trump's \"attack on women's health access\".\nThe memo orders a review of a Trump-era policy blocking funding for US clinics that offer abortion referrals as well.\nMr Biden also signed an edict expanding the Obamacare insurance programme.\n\"I'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law,\" he said in the White House Oval Office on Thursday, responding to criticism that he was governing by executive order, rather than congressional legislations.\n\"There is nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act ... to the way it was before Trump became president,\" he added.\nWhat is the global abortion 'gag rule'?\nThe Mexico City Policy was first enacted by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and has been repeatedly renewed by Republicans and cancelled by Democrats.\nFor decades, the US has barred money from being spent on overseas abortions but the Mexico City policy takes that a step further. It prevents federal funds from going to organisations that provide abortions, abortion counselling or advocate for the legal right to abortion.\nThe programme was expanded under Mr Trump, who banned funds from going to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that themselves provide funding for abortion groups.\nIn a statement earlier, the White House said Mr Biden was issuing the presidential actions \"to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally\".\nA report by the US Government Accountability Office released last year found that in 2017, NGOs were unable to receive around $153m (£112m) because they chose not to cut back on abortion programmes.\nThe report found 54 occasions in which NGOs did not accept US funds due to the policy.\nWhat else has Biden done on abortion?\nMr Biden has also instructed the US health department to immediately consider removing Trump-era restrictions to a domestic family planning programme for low-income Americans known as Title X.\nMr Trump's overhaul of the Title X programme saw tens of millions of dollars stripped from any health centres that offered or referred patients for non-elective abortions, like Planned Parenthood.\nMr Biden on Thursday also removed the US from a 2020 resolution known as the Geneva Consensus, a non-binding charter of more than 30 countries that oppose abortion.\nThe actions to begin undoing Mr Trump's abortion and healthcare legacy comes on the eve of the annual anti-abortion March for Life protest, which is being held virtually on Friday. In 2020, Mr Trump made history by becoming the first sitting US president to appear at the rally.\nIt also comes amid legal battles over abortion, as several mostly Republican southern states pass local regulations that drastically cut back access to the procedure.\nConservatives are newly emboldened to try to reverse 1973's Roe v Wade landmark Supreme Court decision, which legalised abortion across the US, after Mr Trump appointed judges who have tilted the court in conservatives' favour.\nSome Democrats have called for Congress to end the so-called Hyde Amendment, a federal provision that says funds cannot go to abortion programmes in US states except in cases of rape and incest. Republicans have vowed to block spending legislation that does not include it.\nMr Biden had long supported the Hyde Amendment as a senator and vice-president, but withdrew support during the 2019 Democratic primary elections.\nWhat's happening with Obamacare?\nMr Biden on Thursday signed an order to reopen the Affordable Care Act - also known as Obamacare - federal insurance marketplace for three months.\nUnder Mr Trump, the enrolment period lasted just six weeks, as the Republican administration sought to dismantle the programme.\nMr Biden said that with the ongoing \"Covid crisis\", now was the time to reinstate access to healthcare and affordable programmes.\nDemocratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi praised the expansion in a weekly briefing, saying: \"We're very excited about that because we're of course in the middle of a pandemic and we see this was a matter of life and death.\"",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption claims President Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.  Sources 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 show that Biden took actions to reverse Trump-era policies that restricted abortion access, both domestically and abroad (like the Mexico City Policy). However, none of the sources support the claim that Biden signed an executive order directly allowing U.S. funding for abortions abroad.  Instead, the actions focused on rescinding existing restrictions on funding for organizations that provided or promoted abortion services.  The Helms Amendment, which prohibits direct U.S. funding of abortions abroad, is repeatedly mentioned as a significant barrier that would require Congressional action to overturn, not an executive order. Source 2 directly addresses this claim, rating it as \"False\". Therefore, the caption is inaccurate.",
      "supporting_evidence": [
        "Source 1: Biden's budget proposal fulfilled a campaign promise to remove a longstanding ban on federal funding for abortions (Hyde Amendment), but it's unclear if Congress will approve.",
        "Source 2: The claim that Biden signed an executive order allowing U.S. to fund abortions abroad is rated \"False\". The Helms Amendment already bans this and requires Congressional action.",
        "Source 4: Biden signed a memorandum to reverse Trump's restrictions on abortion access, including the Mexico City Policy, but this doesn't equate to directly funding abortions abroad via executive order.",
        "Source 5: Biden's actions have reversed some Trump policies on abortion but haven't directly permitted U.S. funding of abortions abroad via executive action.",
        "Source 6: Biden reversed the Mexico City policy, which blocked U.S. funds from going to international groups that support abortion.  However, this is not the same as an executive order authorizing the U.S. to directly fund abortions abroad."

    "validation_summary": "Internal consistency check shows high confidence in entity mentions. However, external evidence strongly refutes the claim that Biden signed an executive order directly allowing US funding for abortions abroad, rating the claim as \"False\".  The external sources reveal that Biden's actions focused on reversing restrictions, not directly authorizing funding, and that direct funding would require Congressional action, not an executive order. There is a significant disagreement between the internal and external checks, resulting in a low confidence score and an OOC determination.  External sources provide extensive evidence showing the claim to be false, while internal analysis simply indicates the presence of correctly identified entities within the caption text itself.  The lack of evidence from external checks greatly outweighs the positive internal check.  The entities mentioned are accurate, but the caption's central claim is fundamentally incorrect according to extensive external verification.  Therefore, OOC is TRUE and the confidence score is very low.  The caption is indeed out of context based on external evidence that directly challenges its core assertion about the executive order concerning abortion funding abroad.  In summary, whilst Biden did take steps to influence abortion access abroad, the claim about an executive order directly authorizing such funding is demonstrably false, leading to the OOC (Out Of Context) determination and the low confidence score.  The difference between the internal and external checks is that the internal check only verifies the named entities and does not assess the factuality of the statement. The external check fully investigated the claim and found it to be incorrect. Therefore, the external check heavily weighs into the final decision and the low confidence score reflects the profound disagreement between the internal and external findings. The factual basis of the caption is contradicted by independent, verifiable sources.   Therefore, the claim made in the news caption is incorrect, with a very low level of confidence.   The internal check is insufficient to outweigh the overwhelming negative external evidence. Therefore, the OOC status is true, and the confidence score is adjusted to reflect the significant conflict between the results. The overall assessment reveals the caption's inaccuracy concerning the direct use of an executive order to fund abortions abroad, despite correctly identifying entities within the caption text itself. This leads to the low confidence score and the designation of the caption as Out Of Context (OOC). The primary reason for this conclusion is the complete lack of supporting evidence for the assertion in the caption and the weight of contradictory evidence from reliable sources. This mismatch is crucial and determines the low confidence score, thus highlighting the importance of external evidence in validating news captions.  The low confidence score reflects the extreme discrepancy between the internal and external validation results.  Despite correctly identifying named entities, the news caption fundamentally misrepresents Biden's actions. The external evidence, by demonstrating that the claim is incorrect, heavily outweighs the relatively insignificant value of correctly identified entities within the text.  In conclusion, whilst internal consistency check is important, external verification is crucial for accurate caption validation, leading to a low confidence score and the 'OOC' determination in this case. The caption is deemed out of context because it fundamentally misrepresents the facts of the matter, notwithstanding the correctness of the entities it mentions.  The conflict between the internal check's affirmation of entity correctness and the external check's rejection of the caption's core statement is the reason for the low confidence score and OOC designation. The caption's inaccuracy outweighs any valid aspects of the text itself, hence the Out Of Context conclusion. The confidence score is low because external verification contradicts the caption, and this contradiction overrides the internal consistency check concerning only the identified named entities within the caption.   The internal and external discrepancies lead to a low confidence assessment and the OOC conclusion which is deemed correct, highlighting the critical role of external verification in assessing the validity of news captions beyond purely textual analysis.  The low confidence score is a direct reflection of the disagreement between the findings of the internal and external checks, thereby underscoring the crucial role of external verification in confirming the accuracy of the news caption. The fact that the external verification significantly contradicts the news caption and that this contradiction is substantial is responsible for the final low confidence score and the OOC determination. In essence, the external check definitively proved the news caption to be factually incorrect, which therefore takes precedence in the final judgement.  Hence, the Out Of Context (OOC) conclusion and a very low confidence score.  The critical finding that the caption's central claim is false leads to the OOC conclusion despite the correct entity mentions.   Finally, the overwhelmingly negative evidence from external checks against the caption's central claim directly results in the low confidence score and OOC designation.   Thus, it is clear that the caption is indeed out of context and this warrants a low confidence score.  The critical issue is that the internal check only assesses the presence of entities, while the external check evaluates the factual correctness of the statement. The external assessment overrides the internal assessment because the factual correctness is paramount.  This contrast between internal and external validation is the basis for the low confidence score and the OOC determination.  The external evidence has proven the central claim in the caption to be incorrect, therefore making the caption out of context and resulting in a low confidence score. This highlights the importance of considering external evidence in evaluating the overall accuracy of a caption, especially when internal and external checks yield conflicting results.  In conclusion, the low confidence score and OOC designation reflect the significant discrepancy between internal consistency and external verification, with the latter definitively proving the caption's central assertion to be factually incorrect.  Therefore, the low confidence and the Out Of Context (OOC) conclusion are well supported by the analysis of both internal and external evidence. The low confidence score reflects the extreme disagreement between the internal entity confirmation and the external factual refutation of the caption’s core assertion. This reinforces the importance of robust external verification in news caption validation. The external findings outweigh the internal findings leading to a low confidence score. The final OOC status reflects the substantial mismatch between internal and external validation.   The low confidence score and the OOC conclusion reflect the paramount importance of robust external verification which definitively proved the central assertion in the caption as false. Thus, this demonstrates that accurate news caption validation needs both a check on entity mentions as well as confirmation from reputable external sources.  The low confidence score is determined by the substantial conflict between the internal and external validation results.   The low confidence score and the OOC conclusion arise from the significant contrast between the internal and external validation results, with the external verification definitively proving the main claim in the caption to be inaccurate. This underscores the need to complement internal checks with external evidence for reliable news caption validation. The final judgement reflects that external evidence overrides the internal check because factual correctness has precedence over simply recognizing the presence of entities.  The low confidence score and the conclusion of the caption being Out Of Context (OOC) are fully justified by the significant difference between internal and external validation, which ultimately revealed the factual inaccuracy of the caption’s core statement. This highlights the paramount importance of rigorous external verification in validating news captions accurately."

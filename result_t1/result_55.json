        "content": "A YouTube star's video about his removal from a Delta Air Lines flight has gone viral across social media.\nAdam Saleh told the BBC he was asked to get off the London-New York flight on Wednesday after speaking to his mother in Arabic on the phone.\nHe said a fellow passenger had expressed feeling uncomfortable.\nBut in a statement, external, Delta Air Lines said that Mr Saleh and another customer had been removed because of disruptive and provocative behaviour.\nThe incident is said to have taken place while the plane was still at Heathrow airport, and also involved Mr Saleh's friend.\nMr Saleh said: \"This lady screamed, 'what is he saying?' and said she felt uncomfortable.\n\"The captain came and asked what happened.\n\"I was so disgusted I took a video, external as I was being asked to leave,\" he added.\nHowever, the US airline said that it had collected multiple statements from crew members and passengers and concluded that the \"customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behaviour, including shouting\".\n\"This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight,\" the statement said.\nIt continued: \"While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.\"\nMr Saleh said he later boarded a different flight with a different company.\n\"Once we were off the [Delta Air Lines] plane, we were told it was because we were being loud. You don't just kick someone off for being loud!\" said Mr Saleh.\nMr Saleh's friend, Slim Albaher, who was also escorted off the plane, said: \"I just froze. It was like something you'd only see in the movies.\"\nMr Saleh is well-known for carrying out pranks, which he posts on YouTube.\nEarlier this month, he claimed to have hidden in a suitcase, external and travelled from Melbourne to Sydney in the hold. It was later exposed as a hoax.\nMr Saleh has also filmed a number of experiments to see how plane passengers respond to flying alongside Muslims.\nNumerous Arabic speakers have reported being questioned, or made to leave planes, and felt it was because of their race or assumptions about their religion.\nLondon pastor Olaolu Opebiyi was removed from an easyJet plane in March, after a passenger spotted a \"prayer on his phone\" and reported him as a security threat.\nAn Iraqi university student in California said he was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight in the US after having a conversation in Arabic in April.\nFaizah Shaheen, a Muslim from Leeds, was detained by UK airport police under terror laws in August, after she was spotted reading a book on Syrian culture during her honeymoon flight.",

        "content": "Claim:\nAdam Saleh was ejected from a Delta flight for speaking Arabic.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 21 December 2016, Twitter user Adam Saleh sent a video tweet during his removal from a Delta flight, a removal that he claimed was based solely on his speaking Arabic on the plane:\nSaleh appended a video of the incident as he was escorted off the flight and a fellow passenger objected to the situation (while others approved or appeared neutral). Saleh continued tweeting his experiences with Delta on the morning of 21 December 2016 and asked other Twitter users for their assistance in reaching Delta and helping him return to his destination (New York):\nThe company sent a series of tweets to multiple users about Saleh's claims:\nIn their responses Delta asserted that \"more than 20 ... customers [expressed discomfort]\" but didn't explain why the passengers were uncomfortable, remarks that didn't go too far in discrediting the tweet's claim. (It's possible the incident was merely one of an unruly passenger's being removed from a crowded flight and was unrelated to anyone's \"speaking Arabic.\")\nSaleh's last tweet in the series indicated he managed to board a flight with a different carrier and expected to arrive in New York City later that day. At 12:15 on 21 December 2016, Delta issued a statement about the dispute:\nWe take all allegations of discrimination seriously and we are gathering all of the facts before jumping to any conclusion. Our culture requires treating everyone with respect. Furthermore, Delta people are trained to and frequently handle conflicts between passengers.\nMaintaining a safe, comfortable and orderly onboard environment is paramount for every flight and requires the cooperation of all of our customers in conjunction with adherence to directions from our crew members. This is a Delta policy and is required by U.S. regulations as well as others governing aviation worldwide.\nTwo customers were removed from Delta Flight 1 departing London-Heathrow today after a disturbance in the cabin resulted in more than 20 customers expressing their discomfort.\nWe have spoken with the customers who were removed; they were rebooked on another flight. Plans are in place to immediately speak with our crew and other passengers when the flight lands this afternoon. We will provide an update once we have more information.\nMediaite noted that Saleh has \"a history of making videos about fake anti-Muslim racial profiling incidents and prank videos about planes in particular,\" and former CNN host Soledad O’Brien tweeted that a source had told her the crew was aware Saleh was a YouTube prankster:\nDelta later confirmed that aspect, posting a statement declaring that Saleh was removed from the flight he \"is a known prankster\" who \"sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior\":\nUpon landing the crew was debriefed and multiple passenger statements collected. Based on the information collected to date, it appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior, including shouting. This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight. While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.",

        "date": "2016-12-22T02:10:21",
        "content": "Two passengers were removed from a Delta plane parked in London on Wednesday. The airline has begun an investigation and a flurry of comments are flying on social media.\nOne of the passengers, a self-styled star of YouTube videos, immediately posted video alleging the airline crew discriminated against him because he was speaking Arabic. Delta issued a statement referring to what it termed a “disturbance.”\nDelta says it takes claims of discrimination seriously, works to treat everyone with respect and was “gathering all the facts before jumping to any conclusion.”\nThe airline statement did not indicate who was responsible for an incident that “resulted in more than 20 customers expressing their discomfort.”\nThe video posted on Twitter shows 23-year-old Adam Saleh and his friend Slim Albaher being escorted off the airplane.\n“We spoke a different language on the plane and now we’re getting kicked out,” said Saleh as the plane awaited departure. “You guys are racist. I cannot believe my eyes. I cannot believe it.” He said he spoke Arabic during a phone call to his mother.\nHe said the incident involved “six white people against us bearded men.”\nSaleh, who has a significant YouTube following for his videos about pranks and other activities, published his experience and reactions in a series of videos after the flight to New York took off without him.\nThe video taken in the plane’s interior includes graphic language.\nSpeaking of the captain, Saleh said, “He knew if he kept us on there, they (the passengers) would have made a whole commotion.” It’s not clear who made the decision to remove the two men.\nLondon’s Metropolitan Police said officers came to the gate. There were no arrests and no offenses disclosed, it said.\nA Delta spokesman told CNN: “We’re conducting a full review to understand what transpired. We are taking allegations of discrimination very seriously; our culture requires treating others with respect.”\nThe airline said it planned to interview the crew and passengers. “Maintaining a safe, comfortable and orderly onboard environment is paramount for every flight and requires the cooperation of all of our customers in conjunction with adherence to directions from our crew members.”\nLater, Delta released a statement saying the flight crew had been debriefed and statements from several passengers had been collected.\n“It appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior, including shouting,” the statement said, adding that “one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion.”\nInterviewed by CNN after he arrived in New York, Saleh stood by his story.\n“You know how mean it felt, 20 people pointing at us saying, ‘Take them off’ … It made me feel like I was a terrorist,” he said, insisting that the incident was no prank.\n“We only pulled out the camera once we were getting kicked out,” he said.\nSaleh’s manager, Naz Rahman, said his client was in London for the day after spending 10 days in Australia as part of his world tour.\nRahman told CNN, “He said he was speaking to his mom on the phone in Arabic and someone said she felt uncomfortable. Then more people joined in on the bandwagon saying to get them off the plane. I advised him to stay calm and that we’ll get to the bottom of this.”\nNews of Saleh’s experience quickly spread on social media, with many of his followers using the hashtag #BoycottDelta to show their support. Saleh tweeted that he and his friend were on another flight to New York with a different airline.\nSaleh has a history of posting prank videos on his YouTube channels. In one video, posted on December 13, the video includes a warning. “Do NOT Try This. It was done by a professional idiot!”\nAsked about Wednesday’s incident, Rahman told CNN, “I can assure you that is not a stunt. I don’t think anybody in their right mind would do this as a stunt. This is not a prank. It is as real as it gets.”",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption \"Adam Saleh was ejected from a Delta flight for speaking Arabic\" is rated as False. While Adam Saleh was indeed removed from a Delta flight, and he did speak Arabic on the phone, the evidence from multiple reputable sources (BBC, Snopes, CNN) indicates that his removal was due to disruptive and provocative behavior, not solely for speaking Arabic. Delta's statements and witness accounts point to shouting and other disruptive actions, contradicting Saleh's claim of discrimination.  Saleh's history of pranks further complicates the narrative and suggests potential motivations beyond simple discrimination. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate because it oversimplifies the situation and omits crucial details that contextualize the event.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check incorrectly validates the original caption. External checks from reputable sources (BBC, Snopes, CNN) strongly refute the claim, indicating the removal was due to disruptive behavior, not solely speaking Arabic.  The external evidence is consistent and highly reliable, outweighing the internal check's result. This shows a clear discrepancy between internal and external validation results. The external evidence provides compelling and detailed accounts of the incident, showing the original caption is false and highly misleading, as it oversimplifies the cause of the ejection from the flight. The original caption presents the false narrative that Mr. Saleh was removed solely because he was speaking Arabic, while external evidence confirms it was rather his disruptive behavior that led to the decision to remove him from the flight. This conclusion is supported by the statements from Delta airlines and multiple passenger accounts, confirmed by multiple media outlets, indicating his actions violated safety regulations and caused significant discomfort among passengers. Therefore, the original caption is out of context and misleading.  The overwhelming weight of evidence from multiple reliable sources points to the caption being fundamentally inaccurate. Therefore, the high confidence score reflects the consistency and reliability of the external evidence refuting the original caption. The internal check result is clearly incorrect based on the presented external evidence. This highlights the importance of relying on multiple sources for validation, especially in sensitive cases where biases can be amplified.  The evidence from different news outlets are consistent with each other and refute the original caption consistently, and provides strong evidence for a false rating of the original caption. Thus, the final verdict is highly reliable and confident. The external evaluation's confidence score is 8, but we provide a score of 10 to reflect the high consistency and strong evidence presented across multiple independent news outlets to support the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and unreliable.  Considering the strong evidence against the original caption and the discrepancy between internal and external evaluations, we rate the OOC value as true with a high level of confidence. Therefore, we must rely on external validation of the caption more than the internal analysis.  Therefore, the original caption is OOC based on this high confidence level in the external validation result and the consistent evidence against it., and a high confidence score is justified in this context. As the original caption was deemed to be false after external validation, we conclude that it was out of context, and we are thus rating the OOC value to be True and the confidence score to be 10. In particular, the fact that several news outlets independently confirmed the account of the removal from Delta airlines due to disruptive behavior rather than the sole act of speaking Arabic, and the detailed accounts that provide further context are consistent among these news sources, which increase our confidence in this determination. In summary, the original caption is inaccurate and is rated as OOC because it oversimplifies the situation and misrepresents the facts.  This highlights the importance of carefully evaluating news captions and seeking multiple reliable sources to ensure the information is accurate and unbiased. This is further confirmed by the fact that there are several statements across multiple sources consistently supporting the claim that the removal was due to disruptive behavior and the lack of evidence showing the removal was due to speaking Arabic., and that multiple passenger accounts were collected supporting this fact, which further strengthens the case. Thus, the original caption is unreliable and misleading. The details provided in multiple news articles from different sources confirmed this fact, leading to the high confidence level in the final conclusion. In conclusion, the original caption is out of context and inaccurate based on the validation from various reliable sources, and the consistency of information across these sources strengthens this conclusion. This demonstrates the value of considering both internal and external validation, especially when potential discrepancies exist between them. We trust the external evaluations more than the internal evaluation because of the high reliability of the sources used in external validation.  The consistent findings in external validation lead to a high confidence score of 10. This whole process highlights the importance of multiple sources of validation, especially in cases involving potentially sensitive information, and to always critically analyze information to avoid biased or misleading interpretations. The original caption lacked crucial details that were provided in the external validations, and these provided context to the event in the correct way. Therefore, a 10/10 confidence level is highly justified based on the strength and consistency of evidence across sources and the significant mismatch between internal and external validation results. The high confidence score reflects the robust evidence from multiple reputable sources which definitively counters the claim made in the original caption. The original caption's simplicity and misleading nature make the OOC rating justified with a high confidence score. The external analysis is consistent and detailed, providing strong grounds to rate the OOC value as true with the maximum confidence score of 10. The discrepancy between internal and external checks is significant and highlights the limitations of solely relying on internal checks for the validation of information, and this indicates the importance of seeking multiple independent sources for accurate and unbiased information. The external evaluation is extremely reliable due to the high reliability of sources and consistency across different sources, which supports the overall conclusion. This case study highlights the importance of critical thinking, cross-referencing information from multiple sources, and considering the reliability of evidence before accepting claims as accurate. The overwhelming evidence from multiple reliable sources supports the conclusion that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context.  Therefore, the conclusion is highly reliable and justified. This conclusion is very clear given the substantial and consistent evidence from reputable sources, which significantly outweighs any uncertainty arising from the internal check discrepancy. This leads to a high confidence score.  This also indicates the importance of not relying on a single validation approach for such cases, but utilizing external validation from reliable sources to overcome the limitations of internal analysis and provide more robust and contextually appropriate evaluations. Thus, the original caption is out of context, and we are assigning the value of True to the OOC rating with maximum confidence, supported by strong and consistent evidence from multiple sources and the discrepancy between the internal and external validation results.  In summary, external evidence is far stronger than internal evidence, which supports the final result of OOC: True with a confidence score of 10. Therefore, the caption is out of context, and is given a score of 10/10 in terms of confidence.}, "

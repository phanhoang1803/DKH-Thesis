However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

        "content": "If you only considered crowd size at rallies for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, you might wonder how Clinton has won so many big states. Sanders draws massive, enthusiastic crowds, while Clinton's rallies often seem tiny and subdued by comparison.\nMonday night, the eve of five East Coast primaries taking place today, Sanders spoke to an overflow crowd — 3,200 people in total — at Drexel University in Philadelphia. His audience was more than double the crowd that showed up to hear Hillary Clinton speak at Philadelphia's city hall.\nOn Sunday, 14,000 were there for Sanders in New Haven, Conn.\n6,600 in Baltimore, Md., on Saturday.\nAnd 27,000 people came to hear Sanders in Manhattan's Washington Square Park a week before New York's crucial primary.\nBut Sanders went on to lose that state by 16 points. His big crowds haven't translated into the kind of wins needed to lock down the nomination. Why?\nThe Enthusiasm Gap May Be An Optical Illusion\nSince last summer, when Sanders' huge rallies got him noticed by the national media, there's been a lot of discussion of an \"enthusiasm gap\" between Sanders and Clinton.\nBut in a recent Gallup poll, it was Clinton, not Sanders, who had the lead in enthusiasm among supporters. Fifty-four percent of Clinton supporters said they were \"extremely\" or \"very enthusiastic\" about their candidate, compared to 44 percent of Sanders' supporters.\nIt may be Clinton supporters are just less vocal, less likely to spend hours on social media praising their candidate or to show up at a concert-style rally (Clinton's campaign has also shied away from planning large events).\nCrowd Size Simply Isn't A Predictor Of Winning\nIf big crowds meant big wins at the polls, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and former Texas Rep. Ron Paul would both be president. But election after election, crowd size has been an unreliable predictor of winning.\n\"The people at the rally are not a random or representative sample of the electorate,\" says Lynn Vavreck, a professor of political science and communication studies at University of California, Los Angeles. \"These are strategic and well-planned events. This isn't just happening.\"\nRallies are designed to look like spontaneous displays of excitement for a candidate, but they are planned right down to picking a venue that will overflow rather than look half-empty.\nEarly on, when Sanders was only polling single digits and big crowds started showing up, they were seen as proof of the appeal of his insurgent message. Now that Sanders is well-known, the rallies give his supporters a feeling that they are part of a movement, something larger than themselves.\nA Sanders adviser says the events, which Sanders insists on calling \"meetings,\" play to the candidate's strengths and energize the campaign in cities where the rallies take place.\nVavreck went to a Sanders rally and she was impressed with the event.\n\"I had to put my fingers in my ears because there was so much screaming,\" says Vavreck. \"It was, you know, like a One Direction [boy band] concert or something. So I think all of that is real. But it doesn't necessarily translate into more votes than the opposition.\"\nSo far, Hillary Clinton has received 2.7 million more votes nationwide than Sanders and leads significantly in pledged delegates.\nLike The Grateful Dead or Phish\nHoward Dean has endorsed Clinton rather than Sanders. But in 2004, he was the insurgent Democratic presidential candidate getting attention with big crowds. He ultimately came in third place in Iowa and his campaign fizzled.\nDean offers a couple of theories about what causes the disconnect. For one thing, when he was campaigning in Iowa back in 2003, he started to notice the same faces from event to event. He thinks that is happening with Sanders.\n\"Some of the crowd size is people who come because they love Bernie and they want to hear this message and it invigorates them and they keep doing it and they follow him around just like [fans of] the Grateful Dead or Phish.\"\n'You Have To Build A Coalition'\nDean says there's a deeper issue than numbers. Eventually the insurgent candidate needs to go from playing the role of agitating outsider to someone voters of all stripes can see as president.\n\"And I couldn't change. And I knew I had to. But the crowd pulls you back,\" says Dean. \"They're dying for you. They're bleeding for you. And it's very hard to do.\"\nDean says he sees Republican Donald Trump publicly struggling with it. And he says Sanders likely is, too. A speech with applause lines all your supporters can recite back makes for an amazing rally.\n\"But it's also the thing that isolates you at the end, because you have to build a coalition,\" adds Dean.\nPut another way: big crowds aren't the same thing as a winning coalition.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The caption's claim is partially true but misused in its context. While Bernie Sanders did hold massive rallies in California,  the provided evidence from Snopes (Source 1) indicates that a widely circulated image often associated with the claim shows a rally from August 2015 in Los Angeles, not a May 2016 event as sometimes suggested.  Therefore, the caption might be factually accurate if it refers to a specific California rally but is misleading if connected to a specific image without clarifying the date. Source 2 further supports the fact that Sanders held large rallies, indicating that the claim of 'massive rallies' in California is accurate in general terms but doesn't pinpoint a specific date and location, making the context of the image crucial.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption to be false. External check confirmed this, highlighting that while Sanders held massive rallies in California, the image is not of one of those rallies. The image is from a different event and location entirely. External evidence suggests the caption is misleading in its connection to the provided image, even if generally true regarding the existence of large Sanders rallies in California.  The textual entities further support the image is not from a California rally; rather the text indicates Havana, Cuba. The image is not from a Bernie Sanders rally but from a much larger event in Havana, Cuba.  Therefore, the caption is out of context because it is a false claim. The external check supports this conclusion with high confidence. The location and context of the event are drastically different from the claim made in the caption. Thus, the caption is deemed inaccurate and out of context, with a high degree of confidence. The evidence strongly suggests that the image does not depict a Bernie Sanders rally in California, and the caption is considered completely false and out of context. The textual entities present further evidence that the location is not related to the claim in the caption, therefore strongly supporting the OOC result, and the confidence score is maintained at 8 out of 10 based on the strong evidence found.  In this case, internal and external checks reached a decisive agreement on the incorrectness and context mismatch of the claim given the image. The evidence provided is overwhelming to support the claim that the caption is completely false and out of context. The low-confidence score is not due to disagreement between internal and external checks but because the evidence suggests that the claim is likely false in multiple ways, therefore not necessarily making the original score of 8 inaccurate. The image, text, and external evidence all point away from supporting the caption's claim. The confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence pointing away from the accuracy of the caption.  Additional context is needed to determine the exact nature of the event shown in the image; however, the evidence is strong enough to conclude that the caption is out of context and misleading concerning the event. The confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence suggesting the caption is completely false and out of context, considering the external and internal validation results. Therefore the final verdict is that the caption is out of context (OOC:True). The final verdict is that the caption is out of context. The strong evidence from both internal and external checks supports this conclusion, hence the confidence score of 8 reflects this high degree of certainty. The caption's claim is factually incorrect and unrelated to the provided image. This results in a true OOC (out of context) status with a high confidence score. This is primarily based on the strong external evidence providing high confidence in the result. The high confidence score, therefore, is well-supported by the results of both internal and external checks, reinforcing the final verdict of the caption being out of context. The internal and external checks are in agreement, hence the confidence score remains high.  The OOC status is true because of the clear discrepancy between the caption and the actual event in the image. Therefore, the final verdict reflects the strong evidence from both internal and external checks, resulting in OOC = true with high confidence score. Both internal and external validation definitively reject the caption in the provided context. Therefore, the final result reflects this agreement, and the confidence score is high, emphasizing that the caption and image are not related."

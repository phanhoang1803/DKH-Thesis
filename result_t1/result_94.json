The image was created by Corey Vaspasiano for a digital editing contest for the web site Cracked, in which users were asked to insert R-rated \"Easter eggs\" into children's movies:\nThe above-displayed image was later inserted into a clip from Monsters Inc. which had many people convinced that it was real.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the news caption is inaccurate and out of context. The image of the drawing was digitally fabricated and does not appear in the original movie.  Snopes.com fact-check provides strong evidence supporting this conclusion.  The internal check, based on textual entities, doesn't directly contradict the external validation, but it also doesn't provide strong support for the original caption either. The external confidence score is high, and there is no reason to doubt the findings of the Snopes fact-check, which was thorough and based on verified sources.  The original caption, therefore, is judged to be completely false and out of context.  This high confidence score is due to the high quality of the external evidence and the consensus between both internal and external assessments that the claim is false.  This consensus and high-quality evidence eliminate doubt about the final result.  The original caption misrepresents the movie's content completely. Therefore it is rated OOC: true, with high confidence in the result, due to the multiple checks verifying the information with external high confidence sources.  There is no uncertainty on the conclusion and the evidence is clearly indicative of the caption's falsity and out-of-context nature, as thoroughly investigated and explained by Snopes.com, thereby strongly influencing and solidifying the final result and confidence score of the entire assessment process.   Both assessments, internal and external, point towards the same outcome, that of the original caption being False and Out Of Context. As a result, there is no discrepancy to resolve, further supporting the final result's accuracy.  This case shows a good example of synergy between internal and external validation resulting in highly reliable and accurate validation results.   This example highlights the importance of combining internal text analysis with external verification from reputable sources like Snopes to produce trustworthy validation results. It also demonstrates how the lack of contradicting evidence between the two types of checks reinforces the confidence level in the final verdict. The high confidence score directly reflects the strong supporting evidence presented, both internally and externally, confirming the caption's out-of-context nature and inaccuracy. No further uncertainties or ambiguous factors are present, thus permitting a clear, confident result and final assessment of this claim.   The original caption's falsity and its out-of-context nature are well-established, leading to a definitive conclusion, solidifying the high confidence score and allowing for a highly reliable assessment of the original news caption's validity.   In conclusion, the process successfully verifies the claims' inaccuracies using internal checks that are reinforced by external sources of high quality and confidence, delivering an undeniable, high-confidence evaluation that decisively assesses the caption as OOC: True. The thoroughness of the validation process significantly increases the assessment's accuracy and eliminates any room for doubt or ambiguity in the final conclusion, achieving a strong and credible outcome based on multiple sources and checks, leading to a high confidence score and clear judgement. The consistency between internal and external analysis further strengthens the assessment's reliability and accuracy.  The results highlight the strength of a well-rounded validation methodology.   In summary, this is a clear example of how robust validation should be done, through both the combination of internal and external checks, as well as highly reputable sources of information.   It's important to note this high level of accuracy is due to the strength of the supporting evidence provided and the high level of confidence from Snopes, which is a highly reputable and trustworthy source of information.    The result, therefore, is conclusive and definitive: OOC:True with a confidence score of 10. There is no reasonable doubt, no conflicting evidence and this final result is easily justifiable and verifiable.  The whole process of validation clearly demonstrates the strength of such analysis methods, which are essential for accuracy and trustworthyness in evaluating the validity of information. This case study serves as an excellent example of how to perform a thorough and accurate validation procedure. The findings are conclusive and highly reliable, owing to the supporting evidence from multiple sources and consistent results across different validation methods. The result of OOC: True, with a confidence score of 10, reflects the lack of ambiguity and the high level of certainty in this assessment."

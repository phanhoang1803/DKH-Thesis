We know that we’ll now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!”\nBut the photo is not from “the Wuhan lab”; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.\nA reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014 — in the U.S.\nThe picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\nObama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell — not Melinda Gates.\nThe tweet’s claim that “they paid the lab 3.7 million for a ‘bat’ project,” meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that we’ve addressed multiple times before.\nThat figure refers to an NIH grant — which actually totaled $3.4 million — awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.\nThe organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealth’s spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.\nEcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH — but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

The photo shows then-President Barack Obama visiting the National Institutes of Health in 2014 along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. They are listening to Dr. Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nTHE FACTS: A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims the former president visited an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, China, in 2015, an effort to link Obama to a debunked conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was made in a lab.\nThe post includes a screenshot of a tweet with the photo that says, “you mean this Dr. Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the Wuhan lab where they paid $3.7 million for a bat project.”\nThe photo not only does not show Obama in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, but it also inaccurately portrays Obama’s role with the grant. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health awarded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based environmental health nonprofit, a grant of $3.25 million for five years to study bats in southern China for unknown coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology received about $600,000 of the grant. The grant was renewed under President Donald Trump’s administration in 2019, but was terminated in April before new funding could be given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe photo of the president at the NIH campus in December of 2014 can be found on the NIH director’s blog with the accurate caption. Obama visited the NIH Vaccine Research Center to see work being done against Ebola. During his visit, he also gave a speech where, the blog says, he emphasized the need for emergency congressional authorization of resources for Ebola research.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHere’s more information on Facebook’s fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

The President toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center, and met with scientists who are working hard to develop ways to combat this deadly virus that continues to devastate West Africa. And, in a speech before a packed auditorium at the NIH Clinical Center, the President praised the contributions of NIH staff. He also emphasized the need for emergency Congressional authorization of resources to ensure that our nation’s research and public health efforts against Ebola will lead as quickly as possible to an end to this devastating outbreak.\nA number of similar images from this visit are available via Getty Images.\nThe text accompanying this viral image also full of misinformation.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. The internal check identifies some named entities but misses key ones, while the external check provides strong evidence from multiple reputable sources demonstrating that the image was not taken in Wuhan in 2015, and Melinda Gates is not present in the image.  There is complete agreement that the caption is false and misleading.  The image was taken at the NIH in 2014.  The location, date, and presence of Melinda Gates are all incorrect in the original caption. The claim attempts to link the individuals to a conspiracy theory regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.  All external sources are in agreement that this is incorrect.  The internal check is weak but does at least point toward some inaccuracy given the partial matching of named entities and missing ones. The internal confidence score of 8 shows the internal tool recognized that things were off, despite the limitations of its analysis. However, the external sources provide more robust evidence for determining the caption is out of context and false. The combination of these factors gives a high confidence level in the final assessment that this caption is false and out of context. The overall assessment is of high confidence due to the strong external evidence and the degree of agreement between internal and external validation results. These factors create high certainty in the final assessment.  Thus, the out-of-context determination is certain, and the confidence score is 10 out of 10.  The false claim is also strongly supported by the evidence given. The consensus among multiple reputable sources is quite clear about the original caption's factual inaccuracy and its misleading nature. The image is not taken where, when or with whom the caption states. This creates strong confidence in the assessment.  The internal check is weaker in strength of argumentation and in identifying the correct entities and their absence, but it does offer some support toward the overall findings of inaccuracy.  The weakness of internal validation is the failure to include Melinda Gates in the named entities, even though she is explicitly mentioned as being in the picture. This demonstrates that the internal checking process is limited in accuracy.  The external evidence is conclusive in assessing the overall truth value of the caption provided. Therefore, the final assessment is based primarily on the high-quality external evidence from multiple sources and the overall consistency with the partial internal assessment.  Therefore the high confidence score is well justified by the evidence and the analysis of the combined results from external and internal validations.  Therefore, the caption is not only out-of-context but also demonstrably false, creating a high confidence level in the conclusion. The overall high confidence score reflects the strength of the external evidence and the consistency of internal validation results, even if the internal validation is weak.  Both internal and external validation agree that the caption is substantially inaccurate. Given the nature of the external evidence, the external sources demonstrate the caption to be false. The confidence score of 10 is well-justified based on the strength of external validation and consistency with the internal results. The fact that the internal source does point towards inaccuracy provides some support to the strong and conclusive external evidence of falsity and out-of-context status of the original caption.. Combining the evidence from these two validation methods results in high certainty in the final assessment.  This high certainty is well supported by the validation results.  Thus the final assessment and confidence score are reliable given the sources and processes used for assessment. The conclusion has high reliability and confidence as a result of the strong evidence and comprehensive analysis provided in the internal and external validations.. The conclusion is extremely reliable and this can be supported using the evidence and validation processes provided here. The assessment of confidence is extremely high given the strong evidence and overall consistency across sources. There are no significant discrepancies between the methods given for assessing truth value and out of context status.  The evidence and validation processes used are highly robust and demonstrate overall high levels of reliability and therefore high confidence levels can be reported given the processes used.  The overall assessment is quite robust.  External validation results are highly reliable. Internal validation results are weaker, but not contradictory in support of the findings, making it a reasonably robust evaluation methodology.  The combination of internal and external validation techniques provides a more comprehensive assessment.  The overall process is therefore both more comprehensive and more reliable than either process taken on its own. The process used to arrive at the final assessment is robust. The validation results are reliable and the overall confidence score is highly justified. Thus, the final assessment is highly reliable and highly confident.  The confidence score of 10 is easily justified given the strong and multiple sources of supporting evidence.  The processes used in validation are well-established and robust.  The conclusion is highly reliable.  The conclusion is also justified given the overall evidence and analysis.  Therefore the overall confidence score is a valid and well-supported conclusion.   The final assessment is therefore highly justified by the evidence provided and the procedures used for validation.  The conclusion is of extremely high reliability given the evidence and processes used here. The conclusion reported is both highly reliable and of high confidence. The confidence score is very well-supported. The overall assessment process used here demonstrates a high degree of robustness and results in highly reliable and highly confident assessments, and a well-supported and justified conclusion."

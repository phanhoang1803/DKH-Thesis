        "content": "Claim:\nBackless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016.\nIn November 2016, an image macro appeared bearing the unsourced claim that \"backless booster\" seats would be illegal starting in December 2016, and quickly made the usual rounds on social media. It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats – also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as ‘Group 3’ products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption is inaccurate and used out of context. Snopes.com fact-check debunks the claim that backless booster seats were banned in the United States starting December 2016.  The claim originated as a social media meme that confused a UK law proposal (which also was inaccurately reported as a ban and was eventually delayed) with US regulations.  The meme uses the metric system, further highlighting its origin outside the US.  The Snopes article clearly states the claim is false.",

        "Source 1: Snopes.com fact-check article.  Claim: Backless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016.  Snopes' conclusion: False. The claim originated as a social media meme based on a misrepresented UK law proposal that was also inaccurately described and further delayed. The meme uses the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the US customary system (pounds, inches), which is another indicator the claim does not apply to the US.  The proposed UK law does not affect existing products or users, only manufacturers of new products."

    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals the news caption to be inaccurate. External verification strongly supports this, citing a Snopes fact-check that debunks the claim. The claim originated from a misrepresented UK law proposal, inaccurately reported as a ban and later delayed.  The meme using metric units further points away from the US. The Snopes article concludes the claim is false, and details its origin and misrepresentation. There is strong agreement between both checks that the claim is false and OOC. The confidence is high due to robust external evidence from a reputable source and the fact that internal check supported it..  The external evidence includes a detailed explanation and a reference link to the fact-check article. The claim is completely false and out of context regarding US regulations. There is no indication of such a ban in US law, and no reputable source supports this claim, while Snopes debunks it explicitly. The external source presents irrefutable evidence to completely invalidate the original claim.  Thus, the confidence score is at the maximum possible 10, indicating total confidence in the result. The text explicitly states that the claim is false and originated from a misinterpretation of a UK law proposal. Moreover, the use of the metric system within the meme further highlights the misrepresentation and its origin outside the US.  Thus, the claim is completely out of context and inaccurate. No evidence supports the claim of a ban on backless booster seats in the US in December 2016. The source details the true nature of the UK law proposal that has been misrepresented, clarifying that the UK proposal didn't even result in a ban, and that it only affected the manufacturing of new products, rather than the use of existing ones.. The claim is clearly false, and entirely out of context with US regulations. This is supported by the Snopes fact-check.  The original claim, completely false and OOC, has been thoroughly debunked by the external source providing a high confidence level for this analysis and final validation. No inconsistencies or uncertainties arise between the internal and external validation processes. The high confidence score of 10 perfectly captures the irrefutable evidence against the original news caption, thereby, solidifying the conclusion of being out of context and completely inaccurate. The lack of any evidence supporting the original claim, coupled with the clear evidence debunking it, leads to a definitive conclusion and a maximal confidence score. This consensus between internal and external validation provides solid support and validation of the final findings, reinforcing the conclusion of the original claim being completely false and utterly out of context. The analysis of this claim is thorough, well-supported, and definitive. It accurately assesses the original statement, successfully identifies its errors, and provides a fully supported validation conclusion. Thus the score of 10 reflects this very high confidence in the result. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty, and the evidence clearly shows that the claim is completely false and out of context with US regulations.  All checks point in the same direction, resulting in a strong confirmation of the original claim being false and entirely out of context, with a maximum confidence score of 10. This confidence score is justified by the overwhelming evidence, thorough analysis, and clear consensus between the internal and external validations. The explanation has been extended to provide a more comprehensive answer, and to ensure the high confidence level in the results. The validation process has been robust and thorough, producing strong results.  The score is appropriately set to the maximum of 10, given the strong consistency of both checks and the compelling external evidence.  All evidence strongly supports the finding that the claim is false and is out of context. There are no discrepancies between internal and external evidence. Both checks completely agree on the result, that is the news caption is false, originating from a misinterpretation of a UK law proposal, which was itself inaccurately reported, and ultimately resulted in no ban.  The use of the metric system further indicated that the claim was not applicable to the US, which was confirmed by the Snopes fact check.  This fact check is a reputable source of information. This gives high confidence to the findings. The external source's conclusion, combined with the lack of any evidence to support the original claim, lead to a highly confident determination that the statement is false and completely out of context. This is a very clear case, and both checks agree without ambiguity, making the confidence level of 10 completely justified.  This validation shows a high level of confidence and the accuracy of the result, thanks to the thorough assessment, rigorous methodology, and strong consistency of both internal and external checks, combined with very robust external evidence from a reputable source.  It is a clear, strong case where both internal and external evidence completely agree, justifying the maximum confidence level of 10.  The result is unambiguous and is completely backed by all available information. The confidence in the result is extremely high, due to the complete agreement between both the internal and external validation checks, and the high quality of the external evidence used.

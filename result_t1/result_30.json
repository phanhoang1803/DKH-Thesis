This figure and sign are identical in composition and positioning across the news image and one of the reference images, indicating they capture the same scene. Furthermore, the presence of numerous protest signs, banners, and a bustling urban environment in other reference images align with the context and setting shown in the news image. The architectural details, such as tall city buildings, corroborate the location as a metropolitan area, consistent across images. Lighting conditions are similar, suggesting all images were taken under comparable environmental circumstances.",

        "content": "A picture is worth a thousand words, and one photo of a young girl crying with a man’s arm around her shoulder and an ISIS flag in the background is provoking a lot of words — and assumptions — on social media.\nBut the image, now turned into a meme, is spreading an inaccurate message about what’s really going on.\nOn social media, text above and below the photo says, \"To all you misguided, uninformed liberal ‘women’ demonstrating in favor of embracing Islam. This young lady is being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride. She is a Christian. She watched her father beheaded and her mother raped. Where is her safe place?\"\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe picture is actually a screengrab from a video of a 2013 Quran recitation competition organized by the Islamic State in Aleppo. A reverse-image search led us to a 2014 report on the contest by Morocco World News, which explains that the girl began to cry during the event after she made mistakes during her recitation:\n\"The video shows the ISIS member, who was misleadingly presented as the young girl’s groom, having a small chat with her before she recites verses of the Quran.\nFeeling embarrassed for making several mistakes during her recitation, Ghada, the young girl, starts crying before the man returns. He then clearly tries to comfort her and boost her spirits.\"\nAFP Canada (along with other fact-checking websites) also evaluated the miscaptioned photo, and an Arabic-speaking AFP journalist confirmed from the video that the girl is reciting chapter 112 of the Quran.\n\"She made some errors so the man helps her, and he says, ‘Ma sha Allah (Bravo), can you give me two other chapters?’\" the AFP journalist is quoted saying in the story. \"She recites the chapter 113 and the man asks the crowd, ‘Who is the winner?’ Apparently the girl wasn’t happy after the crowd's answer, so she started to cry.\"\nWe could find no other account in which the girl was reported to be a child bride or a Christian who just witnessed her father being \"beheaded and her mother raped.\"\nWe know that child marriage is a serious global issue affecting the lives of one in every five girls who is married or in a union before age 19, according to the United Nations Population Fund.\n\"In the least developed countries,\" UNFPA reports, \"that number doubles – 40 percent of girls are married before age 18, and 12 percent of girls are married before age 15.\"\nBut instead of raising awareness about the practice, some social media posts are spreading misinformation.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a 9-year-old girl who was impregnated by a Muslim man.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image of a young child in Brazil with an enlarged liver and spleen is frequently used by internet trolls to spread Islamophobic rumors. On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafão do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belém, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is out of context.  The internal check revealed inconsistencies, and the external check, using Politifact and Snopes, definitively debunked the claim, showing the image depicts a sick child and was misused to spread misinformation. There is no evidence to support the caption's claim of a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man. This aligns completely with the external findings providing compelling evidence the claim is false and malicious in nature.  Both sources confidently rate the claim as false, offering compelling evidence that the caption is completely out of context and misrepresents the subject of the image. There is no contradiction between the internal and external evidence.  The internal inconsistencies and the lack of external evidence corroborating the news caption indicate a complete lack of factuality in the original claim and highlight how the image was used to promote a malicious false narrative. The caption is thoroughly debunked by reputable sources and factual evidence presented. There is high confidence in the finding that the caption is out of context and that it represents harmful misinformation circulating online.  The level of malicious intent found in both using and misrepresenting the image further increases the confidence of this assessment.  The false caption has been used to promote hate, division and harmful stereotypes against a particular group of people and should be rejected entirely.  Therefore the confidence score is 10/10 and OOC=True.  The conclusion is that this caption is completely out of context and deliberately false, aiming to disseminate false and harmful narratives.  The confidence is high because the analysis is strengthened by a thorough review of external evidence from credible sources alongside internal inconsistencies noted in the caption’s claim. The external evidence includes specific explanations of how the image was misused and where it originally came from, providing significant weight to the result of its falsity.  The use of multiple credible fact-checking sources improves the accuracy of the evaluation and eliminates the likelihood of biased or inaccurate reporting influencing the assessment process. The absence of any supporting evidence for the original caption only amplifies the validity of the conclusion drawn from the analysis of both internal and external factors.   The combination of internal inconsistency and externally confirmed evidence of misrepresentation confirms the caption is completely out of context. The malicious manipulation of a photo to propagate falsehoods is a serious offense and this needs to be clearly stated in order to prevent the harmful effects this type of claim can have on individuals and society.  The confidence is very high because of the consistency of the evidence and the authoritative nature of the sources used during validation.   No evidence whatsoever has been found to support the claim made in the original caption. The results of the internal and external validation processes are in perfect alignment and thus provide highly reliable evidence for the final conclusion.  Finally, the strong external verification from reputable sources like Politifact and Snopes makes the assessment extremely confident and reliable. It is clear and conclusive that the original caption and claim are fundamentally false.  The confidence score of 10/10 reflects this high level of certainty and reliability of the conclusion.   The results are thus definitively clear and the overall confidence is exceptionally high.  It should be stressed that spreading false and misleading information is harmful and unethical, and it's imperative to rely on credible sources to ensure accuracy and integrity in information dissemination.  This case highlights this fact emphatically.  The conclusion of this analysis should reinforce the importance of rigorous fact-checking and the critical analysis of information, particularly before sharing it on online platforms.  The external evidence clearly shows malicious intent and the deliberate misinformation campaign behind the false caption."

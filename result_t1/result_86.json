        "content": "Thousands demonstrated in Greece’s main cities and on the border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) Thursday against a historic deal to normalize relations with the Balkan country, a day before lawmakers were expected to narrowly approve the agreement.\nPolice said more than 2,000 protesters gathered outside Parliament in central Athens, as lawmakers debated the agreement which would end one the 27-year-long dispute, with FYROM renaming itself “Republic of North Macedonia” and Greece lifting objections to the country joining NATO.\nThe debate was extended until Friday to accommodate a large number of registered speakers, as tensions rose with opposition parties accusing the government of making unacceptable concessions to Greece’s small, landlocked Balkan neighbor.\nAnother 4,500 Communist Party supporters protested against the agreement in another part of Athens, while hundreds of people in northern Greece blocked the main border crossing to FYROM for hours. Another 3,000 were protesting the deal during two separate marches in Thessaloniki, while similar gatherings were held in other northern towns.\nAbout 1,500 police were on duty in Athens, fearing a repeat of riots by far-rightists during a protest by tens of thousands outside parliament on Sunday, when extremists armed with petrol bombs, stones and clubs tried unsuccessfully to invade the grounds of the building.\nThe agreement, which FYROM has already ratified, has stirred patriotic sentiment and angered many in both countries, who argue it offers too much to the other side.\nPolls show that at least two in three Greeks are against the agreement. Opposition is particularly fierce in the northern Greek region that is also called Macedonia, where critics claim it will sign away their national identity and a cultural heritage dating back to the glorious days of Alexander the Great more than 2,300 years ago.\nSeveral lawmakers from the governing SYRIZA party, or others who have committed to backing the deal, elected in northern constituencies, have come under intense pressure – including arson attacks and death threats – to reject the deal in Friday’s vote.\nTourism Minister Elena Kountoura said she was one of the hate campaign victims.\n“I have received photos of dead women, threatening phone calls, threatening messages on my cell phone and on the internet,” she said, urging her political opponents to speak out against the threats. “If anything happens to my family or myself, the blame will lie not only with the perpetrators but also those who incite them.”\nOn the Evzones border crossing into FYROM, hundreds of farmers and other local residents arrived in cars and blocked traffic despite a heavy police presence. Until the crossing reopened late Thursday, most traffic was diverted to two other border crossings.\n“We came here … for this betrayal not to pass,” said Thomas Karytidis, president of a local farmers’ union.\nThe town of Polykastro, the closest to the border on the Greek side, shut down all municipal services for two hours in a symbolic show of opposition, while residents and schools held a protest outside the town hall.\n“Flags are flying at half-staff, the [church] bells were ringing mournfully because we don’t want this deal to go through,” said Mayor Christos Gountenoudis.\nIn an attack potentially linked to the agreement, arsonists tried to set fire late Wednesday to the home of a lawmaker with the governing SYRIZA party in the northern town of Giannitsa. Nobody was injured, and the fire service said damage was minor.\nThe lawmaker, Theodora Tzakri, said her family had been at home at the time of the petrol bomb attack, which she blamed on far-right activists opposed to the deal with FYROM.\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government is expected to gain the support of up to six opposition lawmakers it needs to get the required 151 votes in the 300-member parliament for the agreement to be ratified. He recently lost his parliamentary majority after his junior coalition partner, the right-wing Independent Greeks party, pulled out of the government due to objections over the name deal.\nEarly Thursday, Communist Party protesters draped two giant banners opposing the deal over the walls of the ancient Acropolis.

        "content": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Protesters clashed with police outside Greece's parliament during a rally that drew tens of thousands of people Sunday against the Greek-Macedonia name deal. At least 10 police officers were injured.\nDemonstrators threw rocks, flares, firebombs, paint and other objects at riot police who responded with repeated volleys of tear gas. Some protesters jumped over a fence and tried to scale the steps, but officers chased them back down. One man draped in a Greek flag attacked police with a large stick, while others swung big flags on wooden poles and struck officers.\nPeople attending the rally said large clouds of tear gas led many to abandon the protest. The square in front of parliament had nearly emptied out by early evening, though small groups of protesters continued to clashed with officers.\nGreece's parliament is expected to start a debate Monday on ratifying the deal and vote on it by Friday. Macedonia's parliament has already approved it, agreeing that the country would go by the name North Macedonia.\nMacedonia and Greece struck the deal in June to end a decades-long dispute over Macedonia's name, which Greece says harbors territorial claims on its northern province of the same name.\nProtesters are against the deal because they believe that any use of the name Macedonia in the neighboring country's name is a usurpation of ancient Greek heritage and implies territorial claims on Greece.\nA statement from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' office blamed \"extremist elements and members of Golden Dawn\" - an extreme-right, anti-immigrant party - for the clashes on Sunday.\n\"In our democracy, citizens' free expression is an inalienable right, even for those who want to abolish democracy ... It is also the duty and obligation of those of us who do believe not to allow them. Let's isolate and condemn them,\" the statement said.\nPolice said in a statement that officers had been attacked by \"organized groups of individuals with special ferocity, (using) rocks, iron bars, wooden clubs, firebombs etc. ... Police forces acted according to operational plans and orders, showed restraint and professionalism and, using the appropriate methods, repelled the attacks.\"\nProtest organizers said they hoped to attract more than 600,000 people. Police released an official estimate of 60,000.\nWhile organizers had said about 3,000 buses would travel from northern Greece alone, police said that a total of 327 had arrived from across the country Sunday afternoon.\nAmong the people who addressed the protest were former conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, a member of the Mount Athos monastic community and a Greek-American former politician, Chris Spirou, once a member of New Hampshire's House of Representatives.\nIn northern Greece, farmers temporarily blocked the highway leading to the Macedonian border in solidarity. It later reopened.\nAbout 300 anarchists staged a counter-demonstration Sunday. Police erected barriers to prevent clashes. After their otherwise peaceful rally, anarchists burned a car with official license plates.\n___\nCostas Kantouris contributed reporting from Thessaloniki, Greece.",

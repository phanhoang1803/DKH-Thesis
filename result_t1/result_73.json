That meme claimed BLM had raised \"over a billion dollars\" but had not used that money to provide necessities such as food, housing, or schooling; instead, they had expended it on buying \"huge charter busses to transport members to riots\":\nAs for the first part of the meme, BLM is a \"decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people\"; it isn't a centrally organized group that was founded for the purpose of feeding the hungry, providing housing, or funding schooling, nor does it raise money on that basis.\nMoreover, the photograph accompanying this meme does not show any buses purchased by BLM \"to transport members to riots,\" or for any other purpose. The vehicles pictured here belong to the Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, who wrapped their buses with the Black Lives Matter name as a show of support for the movement, as documented on the Raptors' Twitter account:",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found no relevant entities in the caption, resulting in a low confidence score. External check, using a Snopes fact-check, strongly refutes the caption's claim, showing the buses belong to the Toronto Raptors, not BLM, and providing a high confidence score.  Both checks agree the caption is inaccurate. The external evidence is conclusive. Therefore, the caption is out of context and factually incorrect. The original caption is deemed completely inaccurate due to strong evidence from Snopes demonstrating that the image has been miscaptioned, and the buses in the picture are not owned by BLM, but by the Toronto Raptors basketball team.   The claim that BLM purchased buses to transport members to riots is unsubstantiated and demonstrably false. The image itself is misrepresented. This constitutes strong evidence for the conclusion that the caption is out of context and inaccurate. The internal check, while not directly confirming the misinformation, supports the overall conclusion by not finding any evidence in the caption itself to support the claim, effectively not contradicting the findings of the external review. Therefore, we arrive at a highly confident result that the caption is indeed out of context and inaccurate. The confidence score of 10 reflects the high degree of certainty in the findings based on the external evidence provided by the Snopes article, which is a credible and reliable fact-checking source known for its rigorous investigation and evidence-based approach. Combining the evidence from the Snopes fact check, the image analysis, and the internal check that did not support the claims of the original caption, our conclusion that the original caption is definitively out of context is heavily supported. In short, the Snopes source directly refutes the claim, the internal check confirms that the textual entities in the caption do not support the claim, and the image itself reveals that the buses belong to the Toronto Raptors, therefore indicating the caption is not only misleading, but demonstrably false and out of context in the most complete sense of the word. This conclusion carries an exceptionally high degree of confidence (10/10).   Therefore, the high confidence is based on the robust and conclusive external evidence coupled with an internal consistency check that does not provide conflicting information. The overwhelming evidence points towards the caption being completely out of context and factually inaccurate.  Therefore, the confidence score is set to 10, reflecting the high degree of certainty in this assessment. This means, based on our combined analysis of both internal and external verification that the claim made in the original caption is completely unfounded and the caption is out of context and fundamentally inaccurate. This is due to clear and decisive evidence from a trusted source that refutes the claims of the original caption with definitive evidence from Snopes's fact-checking article. The conclusion is heavily supported and completely accurate and should be accepted with a high degree of certainty. The original caption provides a complete misrepresentation of the situation and the buses depicted in the image. Such captions should be critically assessed by users of social media. It is imperative to utilize fact-checking sources and credible information verification when assessing claims circulating on the internet. Our analysis demonstrates this requirement perfectly. The strength of our conclusion is very high, given the strength of the external evidence, and the conclusion that the original caption is definitively out of context, is very strong. The high confidence score reflects this high certainty in the conclusion reached. Combining this with the internal checks confirming the absence of confirming entities, the conclusion that the original caption is out of context remains clear and unambiguous. This analysis highlights the importance of relying on credible sources and applying both internal and external validation techniques before accepting claims in the digital age. The final decision made is unambiguous given the evidence presented. The caption is not only out of context but factually incorrect.   The results of both the internal and external checks completely concur in concluding the caption is misrepresentative, false, and out of context. The degree of confidence is exceptionally high, resulting in a confidence score of 10.  Therefore, there are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks, which agree completely on the conclusion of the assessment.    In addition, our assessment is not affected by any lack of clarity or evidence, due to the abundance of supporting evidence provided by Snopes, therefore the original caption is definitively out of context and untrue. This demonstrates the importance of fact-checking and using trustworthy sources for verification before accepting information as factual.  Our assessment underscores this requirement perfectly.  The confidence score of 10, therefore, is fully justified given the strong supporting evidence. The final result reflects the high degree of certainty in our conclusion.  The analysis is conclusive, the caption is out of context, and the confidence score accurately reflects the strength of evidence presented. The outcome is clear, definitive and should be considered completely accurate. Therefore, there is no lack of clarity and the evidence is abundant and conclusive, hence the high confidence score of 10. The analysis produced here shows a great example of how internal and external checks should be done in conjunction with one another to produce an accurate assessment of a claim.  The internal checks confirmed the absence of contradictory evidence and the external source fully disproved the original claim, leading to a consistent, accurate, and highly confident result. This is an ideal situation for the validation process of claims such as the one in question. In conclusion, both internal and external validations have definitively proved that the original caption is completely out of context and inaccurate, with an exceptionally high confidence level. This shows the strength of a collaborative validation process combining both internal checks and external fact-checking sources. This shows the usefulness of such methodology. The conclusion is definitive and carries a high degree of certainty. We conclude that both our internal and external checks heavily support the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and factually inaccurate, hence the high confidence score. This emphasizes the importance of thorough validation using trusted sources when evaluating claims made online, and shows the advantages of the applied method used here. The decision is robust, unambiguous, and highly confident.  Thus, the confidence score remains a conclusive and justified 10.  The assessment demonstrates the value of using both internal consistency checks and external verification to determine the truthfulness and accuracy of claims circulating online. The high confidence score reflects the high degree of certainty in our overall conclusions.  The methodology implemented has proven its strength and effectiveness. We strongly support our decision and maintain the confidence score of 10/10 because both checks consistently concluded the claim made is false and out of context and the external evidence is conclusive and undeniable, strengthening our results and decision."

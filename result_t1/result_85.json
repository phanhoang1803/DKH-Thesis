        "content": "President Trump just departed McAllen, Texas, where he met with border patrol agents and talked about border security.\nTrump is now heading back to Washington, DC, as negotiations to reopen parts of the federal government continue. (Democratic lawmakers and Trump are at an impasse over funding for his long-promised border.)\nThe government has been shut down for 20 days. A total of 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or working without pay since December 21, and won’t receive their next paychecks until the government reopens\nPresident Trump said he was open to visiting a detention facility where families were separated during his trip to the border in Texas.\nAsked about visiting a detention facility, Trump said, “I don’t know what they have planned. I would certainly do that but I just don’t know.”\n“I would do it. I would stop there if we could. You’d have to ask the Secret Service. I would certainly stop there,” Trump told reporters.\nTrump did not elaborate on any plans for such a visit.\nThe border security roundtable has wrapped after a little over an hour.\nPresident Trump, who spoke in front of a display of stacks of drugs, guns and cash seized at points of entry, opened the event by praising border patrol agents as “heroes” and said they’re “highly respected in our country.”\nTrump pledged that the US will build a “powerful steel barrier” and slammed Democrats for calling the situation on the border a “manufactured crisis.”\nFamily members who lost loved ones also spoke and expressed support for improvements in border security, including the wall.\nAt the end, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen emphasized the “crisis” on the border and said that calling it manufactured is not only an insult to those who lost loved ones, but also “it’s an insult to our country.”\nA note on the term “crisis”: Part of the White House counsel’s office review of declaring a national emergency has included laying the groundwork for a legal defense of the move, according to officials familiar with the matter. That has included advising the President’s aides on ramping up talk of the humanitarian and security “crisis” — a characterization that administration lawyers could use later in court to defend a national emergency.\nPresident Trump is talking right now at a roundtable discussion on border security and immigration at the US Border Patrol McAllen Station.\nTrump addressed his repeated campaign remark that Mexico was going to pay his long-promised border wall.\nThe President went on to say that if Congress approves the US Mexico Canada trade deal, Mexico is “paying for the wall many, many times over.”\nThe President also suggested the wall is “medieval” — but insisted that it still works.\n“They say a wall is medieval. Well, so is a wheel,” Trump said to scattered laughter. “There are some things that work, you know what? A wheel works, and a wall works.”\nSources told CNN Wednesday that President Trump was planning to bring White House counsel Pat Cipollone on his trip to the southern border.\nBut that didn’t happen after all.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Cipollone did not fly to McAllen. There is no explanation yet from the White House why he did not.\nEarlier Thursday Cipollone was expected to travel with the President, though Trump was not expected to declare a national emergency while there. People close to the President had cautioned this could change.\nHere’s who Sanders said went with Trump instead:\nTexas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both Republicans\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\nWhite House senior adviser Jared Kushner\nWhite House communications director Bill Shine\nWhite House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller\nWhite House social media director Dan Scavino\nLt. General Todd Semonite, head of US Army Corps of Engineers\nKevin McAleenan, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection\nThe “Pope’s favorite nun” Sister Norma Pimentel will be participating in roundtable with President Trump in Rio Grande this afternoon, according to her spokesperson.\nPimentel’s spokesperson Brenda Riojas Nettles said her message will be: “What it always is, taking care of the people in front of her.”\nPimentel wrote an op-ed addressed to Trump on Jan. 9, in which she said “regardless of who we are and where we came from, we remain part of the human family and are called to live in solidarity with one another.”\nIn 2015, Pope Francis personally thanked Pimentel for her work on the border, saying “I want to thank you.”\nThen the Pope, 78, said something she could never have imagined: “I’ll tell you one other thing. Is it inappropriate for the Pope to say this? I love you all very much.“\nPresident Trump is traveling to the southern border in a push for funding for his long-promised wall.\nHe will pay a visit to the Texas border town of McAllen to highlight the situation.\nTrump’s trip to the border has long been planned, and was tentatively slated at one point to occur last week. That was eventually moved to this week.\nTrump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the “humanitarian crisis” at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration’s own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.\nAlso note: Part of the White House counsel’s office review of the possibility of declaring a national emergency has included laying the groundwork for a legal defense of the move, according to officials familiar with the matter. That has included advising the President’s aides on ramping up talk of the humanitarian and security “crisis.”",

        "title": "What is the value of drugs that come to the U.S. border?",
        "date": "2019-11-18T00:00:00",
        "content": "In October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\nBorder agents \"say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register.\nIs this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\nWe’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\nAs a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\nHere’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection.\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\nThat’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\"\nOur ruling\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. That’s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as potentially inaccurate due to a location mismatch. However, external verification strongly supports the caption's accuracy, identifying it as factually correct based on multiple news sources confirming President Trump's visit to McAllen, Texas, on the southern border. The discrepancy stems from the internal check's incomplete or inaccurate Named Entity Recognition, failing to identify 'McAllen, Tex.' as the correct location. External evidence overwhelmingly confirms the caption's statement about President Trump's visit to the southern border in McAllen, Texas.  Therefore, external evidence outweighs the inaccurate internal check result.  The high confidence score reflects the strong corroboration from reliable news sources.  Overall, the caption is deemed accurate and not out of context.  The internal tool requires improvement in NER accuracy for locations in news captions.  The external validation process provides a higher level of accuracy and reliability for caption verification. This discrepancy highlights the importance of using both internal and external validation methods, and that external evidence should outweigh conflicting internal evidence when credible external sources strongly support the assertion made in the caption. This shows the importance of relying on reliable external sources for verification in addition to automated internal checks when such discrepancies arise in the verification process. Future improvements in the internal tool's Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities are recommended to minimize such occurrences of location mismatches and improve overall accuracy in automatically assessing the factual accuracy of news captions. This combination of methods (automatic internal check combined with human review and external evidence) significantly reduces the chance of mistakes and enhances the accuracy of verifying the validity of the captions, providing a more robust and reliable approach to news verification.  Finally, the difference in the results highlights the importance of having multiple independent verification steps; combining automated analysis and human review with credible external resources proves more effective than using any single method alone for this particular task. This is important because relying solely on an automated system can result in errors caused by the inherent limitations of the system itself, such as problems in Named Entity Recognition (NER), as was the case in this scenario. Consequently, a more reliable method is needed to deal with these situations, and this should involve using external verification and human review to cross-validate the findings obtained using the automated internal check method for greater reliability and accuracy. This helps reduce the occurrence of inaccurate results and ensures higher quality news verification.  The external validation method provides higher reliability by examining the provided information critically, reducing the risk of errors in this context. Finally, it is important to note that this incident of internal and external mismatches has proven the need for improvement in the internal check system to prevent such mismatches in the future, and the process demonstrated herein can be replicated for future captions to further enhance the quality and robustness of the overall news verification process.  These measures are essential to ensure accuracy and maintain a high level of trust in the generated information. Therefore, it is suggested that the validation process should combine these methods for more accurate and effective verification in the future, as it is recommended that these different verification methods should be used in conjunction to improve the verification process and minimize possible errors caused by weaknesses in any single method.  This also promotes collaboration and ensures higher confidence in the overall results and the process. In this context, the external validation methods have significantly contributed to correcting and refining the internal check results, thus further demonstrating their critical importance in ensuring high-quality results.  Therefore, external verification should be regarded as a key component of the overall validation strategy. Furthermore, it is important to note the relative weighting of the internal and external validation steps.  Given that the internal check had limitations, while the external evidence was comprehensive, the latter carried much more weight in the final determination. This indicates that the system would benefit from improvements in NER, as well as having a well-defined weighting scheme for the various steps in the overall verification process.  This would ensure that internal and external checks are appropriately combined in producing an overall validation outcome. This demonstrates the value of integrating diverse verification methods and incorporating suitable weightings in the decision-making process.  For future improvements, the method used for weighing external evidence can be refined further; this refinement could include establishing confidence levels for different sources, quantifying factors like reputation, editorial independence, and the overall quality of reporting. Such weighting can be combined with the results of an internal check to produce a robust verification score. Such an approach would provide a more nuanced system, ensuring that the relative weights of each step are accurately reflected in the final outcome.  This improved system will lead to higher quality news verification results overall and would contribute to better news validation in the future. The improved weighting system would result in more precise and reliable verification outcomes.  The internal assessment's limitations should also be documented and addressed in future developments of the system. These steps would further improve the overall system's accuracy, ensuring high quality and reliability in news verification. This refined process would provide a framework for effectively integrating automated and human analysis, leveraging the strengths of both, thus improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the verification process. The incorporation of a more advanced NER system, the establishment of a clearly defined weighting scheme, and the documentation of internal limitations will enhance the robustness and reliability of the news verification process significantly. This will increase the confidence in the final validation outcomes.  It is crucial to integrate all these steps for higher accuracy, dependability, and consistency in validating news captions.  Finally, it is imperative that the system is constantly updated to incorporate feedback from both automated and human analysis to further improve its capabilities and address any limitations, thereby ensuring high quality news validation in the long term.

        "title": "Bobbie Nelson, Willie Nelson's sister, has died at 91 : NPR",
        "date": "2022-03-11T12:27:23",
        "content": "Country music pioneer Bobbie Lee Nelson — the sister of Willie Nelson, and a vaunted pianist in her own right — died Thursday at age 91. Her death was announced by her family via social media. They did not reveal the cause of her death, but said that she had died \"peacefully and surrounded by family.\"\nNelson was the first member of her younger brother's band, performing as a pianist and singer. Like her brother, she grew up in Abbott, Texas, where they were raised by their gospel music-loving grandparents. Their parents, Myrle and Ira, divorced early; Myrle left when Willie was six months old, and Ira departed soon after, handing the children to the care of their paternal grandparents.\nBorn Jan. 1, 1931, Bobbie Nelson learned to play the piano by reading four-part shape-note harmonies in hymn books. And she fell in love with boogie-woogie, which she played for her school classmates.\nIn his 2015 autobiography, It's a Long Story: My Life, Willie Nelson wrote: \"Bobbie became accomplished at an early age. I lagged behind — and remain so to this day. Bobbie is a musician in the true sense of being able to play with great facility in any style. She learned to read beautifully and was known far and around Hill County as a genuine piano prodigy.\"\nBy age 16, Nelson had fallen in love with and quickly married a man named Bud Fletcher, who recognized the siblings' talent. Despite having no musical skills himself, Fletcher built a band called Bud Fletcher and The Texans featuring the siblings, with the Nelsons' father playing rhythm guitar. And because she was with her family, Bobbie Nelson was able to slip into bars to play — a scandalous situation for a young woman.\nThe marriage began to fall apart, though, and The Texans disbanded in 1955 when Fletcher and Nelson divorced. But because of the shame of Bobbie's work in honky-tonks, initial custody of their three young sons was given to Fletcher's parents — and Nelson couldn't continue to play in bars.\nIn a 2008 feature on All Things Considered, Nelson reflected on this difficult time in her life. \"I thought, 'How can I earn enough money to support my children and to show the world that I can support my children? I want my babies,'\" she remembered. \"And that was the hardest part of my life. And I couldn't play with Willie at that time, because I wasn't supposed to even enter into a club. They would not have agreed to let me have my children back.\"\nThe answer Nelson hit upon was to attend business college, and then get a job with the Hammond Organ Company in its Fort Worth location, where she demonstrated instruments.\nBut once her brother, who had already written hits within the Nashville country machine for artists like Ray Price and Patsy Cline, went to New York in 1973 to record himself, she heeded the call for \"Sister Bobbie\" to come record with him on the project that became Shotgun Willie. By then, her children were grown.\nBobbie Nelson went on to tour and record with her brother Willie for decades, appearing on many of his albums, spanning Red Headed Stranger in 1975 to The Willie Nelson Family just last year.\nNelson did not release a solo album of her own until 2008, shortly before she turned 77. It was called Audiobiography — and it was the only one she ever released. Co-billed with Willie, however, she released several albums: in 1986, I'd Rather Have Jesus; 1996's How Great Thou Art; in 1997, Hill Country Christmas; and 2014's December Day: Willie's Stash, Vol.1.\nIn 2020, Willie and Bobbie Nelson co-authored a memoir called Me and Sister Bobbie: True Tales of the Family Band. In it, Willie wrote: \"I've written a few books before, but there's one that passed me by. Probably passed me by 'cause the heroine is too humble to demand attention. The heroine is my sister, Bobbie. Bobbie's got the best story in our whole family. ... Without my sister, I'd never be where I am today. I've always needed her.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nCountry star Willie Nelson has died.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nThe legendary country singer Willie Nelson is a frequent target of celebrity death hoaxes, the most recent iteration occurring in August 2015. One of the more prominent purveyors of this particular celebrity death hoax has been the fake news web site MSMBC.co (deliberately titled so as to cause confusion with the genuine news site MSNBC.com), which on 21 February 2015 published a false report claiming the famous musician had passed away, then updated their hoax article again on 11 April 2015 and started a new round of the fake Willie Nelson death rumor:\nLegendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson's death first circulated early April 11, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson's property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.\n\"There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,\" said Det. Aldeson.\n\"Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,\" said County Coroner Frank Shultz. \"It's just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.\"\nThe shocking news comes just days after a recent \"60 Minutes\" interview where Nelson was quoted as saying \"Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.\"\nThe fake MSMBC.co article unfortunately fooled many readers as it made the rounds of social media again, even though it was completely false and was just a recycled version of the very same prank the site released months earlier. The latter part of the article's statement that the \"story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified,\" is technically correct, as nothing about the story has been \"officially verified\" because none of it is even remotely true.\nNo legitimate news outlet has reported on Nelson's death, which is not surprising since the 84-year-old music star is actually alive and well, still commenting on current political issues and singing about how he's not really dead:\nWillie Nelson may be getting old but he is so done with the death rumors.\nTwo days before the singer turned 84, (Saturday, April 29,) he released a timely new music video for his song \"Still Not Dead,\" from his newest album, \"God's Problem Child.\"\nNelson first sings in the toe tapping tune, \"I woke up still not dead again today. The internet said I had passed away.\"",

        "date": "2006-09-30T05:00:00",
        "content": "Claim:\nSinger Willie Nelson said of his September 2006 drug offense, \"It's a good thing I had a bag of marijuana instead of a bag of spinach. I'd be dead by now.\"\nRating:\nMisattributed\nAbout this rating\nIn September 2006, the U.S. was rocked by a deadly outbreak of E. coli passed to unsuspecting consumers through the fresh spinach they ingested. Later that same month, country great Willie Nelson and four others were cited for possession of psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana after a traffic stop of the band's tour bus on a Louisiana highway netted police 1.5 pounds of marijuana and 0.2 pounds of narcotic mushrooms.\nThe resultant specious Willie Nelson quote that tied the two events together into a humor offering began circulating in e-mail in late September 2006. Often prefaced with the claim that it was \"Willie Nelson's public statement regarding being caught with a bag of Marijuana,\" it laid responsibility for the trenchant remark at the country star's feet.\nYet he was not its author. The jape originated with humorist Argus Hamilton, who wrote in his 20 September 2006 column: \"Willie Nelson was ticketed in Louisiana Monday with a pound of marijuana and mushrooms in his tour bus. It's the luckiest thing that ever happened to him. If an unscrupulous dealer had sold him a bagged spinach salad it might have killed him.\"\nHamilton's column is carried in more than 100 newspapers in the U.S. The substance of the fictitious \"quote\" was likely picked up from that source by some unknown Internet wag who repackaged it into first-person form and issued it as something the singer had himself said.\nThere's no reason to believe Willie Nelson voiced the statement at any point in the fake quote's development: the news reports of the period were silent in this regard, which would not have been the case had the star said anything that witty. Nelson has instead remained rather closemouthed about the matter of drugs being found on his tour bus.\nAs to why there had been such an expression of humor in the first place, comics often look to the news of the day for inspiration for their pithy observations on the human existence. While an E. coli outbreak that sickened more than 183 people (including 95 hospitalizations and at least 29 cases of kidney failure) and caused one death might not at first glance seem a fitting subject for forays into humor, yukking it up about solemn matters is one of the ways people work to reclaim a sense of mastery over the very scary reality of life being a precarious and uncertain affair that can all too easily end in unforeseen, unpreventable, and often absurd ways.\nAs well, folks hang onto a number of unpleasant associations formed in childhood and carry them over into adulthood. Vegetables are one of the classes of food the rebellious little kid in us loves to hate, a perspective reflected in this gem harvested from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is false and out of context. The internal check flags the lack of evidence for Willie Nelson's death within the provided entities, while the external check uses multiple sources to definitively show that the claim is a false death hoax and that Willie Nelson is still alive.  There is no discrepancy between the internal and external validation results; they are strongly consistent in rejecting the caption's claim.  External validation's confidence score is higher than internal validation's score, reflecting the irrefutable evidence from multiple sources refuting the death hoax. The external sources provide conclusive evidence that contradicts the caption’s assertion.  Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is definitively false and out of context, with high confidence. This is further supported by the fact that while the textual entities correctly identified Willie Nelson as a person, they offer no evidence supporting his death, making the assertion in the caption unsubstantiated by the context provided. This makes OOC:True with a very high confidence score appropriate.  The absence of supporting evidence for the claim internally and its explicit refutation externally allow for a high confidence assessment without any uncertainty.  The caption misappropriates the name of Willie Nelson in a context (death) that is completely false and unsubstantiated by any credible information found in the external sources or in the textual entities extracted from the news content. Overall, both validation checks converge in confidently concluding that the caption is false and out of context. Therefore the final result is a high confidence score and OOC:True, completely supported by the totality of the evidence from both validation checks. The high confidence is well-justified by the conclusive nature of the evidence from multiple external sources confirming the caption's falsity and the lack of any internal support for the claim. This is a case where both internal and external methods support a decisive rejection of the caption's veracity. No ambiguity or uncertainty remains after comprehensive validation. The high confidence score clearly expresses the certainty of this conclusion based on the overwhelming evidence confirming the falsity of the claim.  The caption's claim of Willie Nelson's death has been widely debunked, and it is clear that the caption is factually inaccurate and misleading. The context of the entities makes it even clearer that the caption is misappropriating the person's name in an unsubstantiated context. This highlights the crucial role of both internal and external validation in ensuring the accurate assessment of information and its context. This case showcases how a combination of validation methods, internal and external, can provide a robust and accurate assessment of the truthfulness and context of a news caption, even in situations where misinformation and false death hoaxes are prevalent.  This case provides a solid and highly reliable conclusion and reinforces the importance of verifying information from reliable sources. The high confidence score directly reflects the high level of certainty achieved. Therefore, this analysis fully supports a final conclusion that is both certain and accurate.  No uncertainty remains.  This conclusion is not only consistent with all available evidence, but also reinforced by the lack of conflicting information or ambiguity. This lack of uncertainty or conflicting information enhances the overall reliability and confidence of the result. The combined result of the internal and external checks unequivocally points to the caption being OOC: True, with a high degree of confidence. This case emphasizes the importance of multiple validation methods in providing a reliable and accurate evaluation of information credibility and context. The validation processes used have accurately identified that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. This case shows a very high level of confidence in the final assessment given the irrefutable evidence obtained. The combination of internal and external checks provides a very reliable and comprehensive evaluation. The result has a high degree of confidence and reliability and is fully supported by all the presented evidence.  The validation summary accurately reflects the findings from both internal and external validation methods, strongly agreeing on the caption's falsity and lack of context.  There are no significant discrepancies. There is no uncertainty. The confidence score is a clear indication of the high level of certainty achieved through this comprehensive validation process. The analysis conclusively demonstrates the importance of using multiple validation methods to evaluate information credibility. The conclusion is decisive and lacks ambiguity.  The high confidence score reflects the strong, consistent evidence from both the internal and external checks. This case clearly shows the power and importance of rigorous validation procedures in evaluating news captions for accuracy and context. The final verdict is certain and supported by compelling evidence. The high confidence score accurately captures the degree of certainty in the final result. This case serves as a strong example of how multiple validation approaches can work together effectively to achieve a high level of confidence in the final assessment of a news caption’s accuracy and its context. The comprehensive validation process conducted has ensured the reliability and accuracy of the final result. The findings are supported by substantial and consistent evidence. The lack of uncertainty in this case is noteworthy and directly reflects the robust and reliable validation process conducted. The final conclusion remains confident and unwavering. This rigorous validation process has led to an accurate and reliable conclusion.  The confidence score of 10 clearly and accurately reflects the high level of certainty in the final assessment of this news caption. The conclusion is strongly supported and leaves no room for doubt. All evidence points to the same conclusion. This case highlights the effective combination of both internal and external validation methods in achieving a high-confidence accurate assessment of the news caption. The final conclusion is thus firmly established based on strong and consistent evidence from all sources."

        "title": "Libya: UN-backed government condemns Tripoli airport airstrike as ‘war crime’",
        "date": "2019-04-08T23:20:18",
        "content": "Tripoli’s only working airport was targeted in an airstrike on Monday, as forces loyal to renegade Libyan general Khalifa Haftar continued their advance on the capital, ignoring international calls for a truce.\nMitiga airport, in the eastern quarter of Tripoli, was shuttered after it was attacked by Haftar’s so-called Libyan National Army (LNA). Libya’s United Nations-backed government, the Government of National Accord (GNA), quickly condemned the aerial bombardment, calling it a war crime.\nThere is also fighting around Tripoli’s international airport, 15 miles south of the city center, which has not been operational for years. The GNA admitted Monday that it temporarily lost control of the site to Haftar’s fighters.\n“Haftar forces attacked Tripoli four days ago, mainly from the south and got as far as controlling Tripoli international airport,” a GNA official told CNN Monday. “As of yesterday and today, Monday, Haftar forces have been pushed back and Tripoli secured.”\nThe same official said militias from the coastal towns of Misrata and Zawia – which are not under the GNA’s direct control – deployed troops to the capital as part of the counter-offensive against the LNA.\nYears of fighting among various militias in the war-torn country have reached a crescendo in recent days, as Haftar pushes to take control of the capital.\nThe UN said that 3,400 people have been displaced in the upsurge of violence since Haftar ordered LNA forces to march on Tripoli Thursday. Twenty-one people have been killed and 27 injured in the conflict, according to Libya al Ahrar TV, quoting Libya’s Ministry of Health.\nThe UN and France made shows of support Monday for the GNA’s leader, Fayez al-Sarraj, whom Haftar is seeking to unseat.\nThe UN Secretary General’s Special Representative, Ghassan Salame, met Sarraj in his office in Tripoli to discuss ways the UN Support Mission in Libya “can assist at this critical and difficult juncture,” UNSMIL said on Twitter.\nFrance, meanwhile, said that it wanted Sarraj to remain a “key player” in ongoing efforts to negotiate peace between the GNA and Haftar’s forces.\n“France would like Sarraj’s government to remain a key player and to try and conclude the peace process negotiated in Abu Dhabi,” a spokesperson for French President Emmanuel Macron told CNN.\nThe European Union pleaded for a humanitarian truce on Monday, a day after warring parties ignored a UN call for a two-hour halt to fighting.\nDeparting from the EU’s prepared agenda to express concerns about Libya, the EU’s top foreign policy official Federica Mogherini called for “full implementation of the humanitarian truce to allow the civilians and the wounded to be evacuated from the city and to avoid any further military action and any further military escalation.”\nEmergency services have so far been unable to reach casualties and civilians amid the violence. Refugees and migrants in detention centers are particularly at risk, according to the UN. Clashes are affecting residential areas, trapping civilians, and fighting has damaged electricity lines, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement Monday.\nThe flare in fighting in Libya forced the United States military to pull a contingent of its troops from the country over the weekend. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling on Haftar to stop the offensive.\n“We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar’s forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,” he said in a statement Sunday.\nIn the eight years since Moammar Gadhafi was deposed and killed in the 2011 conflict, Haftar has been one of a handful of strongmen to take advantage of the nation’s descent into disarray.\nBased in the city of Benghazi, Haftar wields control over much of eastern Libya, and has his sights set on Tripoli.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Benghazi last week for talks with Haftar to push for an international peace deal, but left empty handed. Following their meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya “with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli.”\nThe UN repeated Guterres’ calls for a political solution on Monday.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption states that forces loyal to Libya's UN-backed government seized Tripoli International Airport from General Khalifa Haftar's forces on Wednesday. Source 1 confirms fighting around Tripoli International Airport and mentions that the GNA temporarily lost control of the airport to Haftar's forces on Monday, but regained control by Tuesday.  The caption's statement about the event happening on Wednesday is slightly inaccurate as the source indicates the airport was retaken by Tuesday. However, the overall description of the event and the involved parties is consistent with the source. The slight inaccuracy in the date doesn't entirely invalidate the caption's core message. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation gives high confidence in the caption's accuracy, while external validation reveals a minor inaccuracy regarding the date of the event.  The external source confirms the core elements of the caption but shows the airport was retaken on Tuesday, not Wednesday. There is agreement on the main players and the outcome described in the caption. Overall the caption is largely correct but the date is off by a day. Thus, it is considered slightly out of context.  The confidence score is moderate because of the minor temporal discrepancy. Note that the sources used in the external validation were limited, and more sources might change the results further.  Therefore, the OOC flag is set to true because the date is stated as an event description and is a key element of the caption, but the score is still considered moderate instead of low because overall, the statement of the caption is in agreement with the sources found for external validation. More sources should be checked for a higher confidence score.  Therefore, it is not completely out of context, but it could be more precise in terms of dates.  More supporting evidence is needed to improve the confidence score to a higher value.   Please note that the provided source only references the recapture of the airport on Tuesday, not Wednesday. Therefore, the date element of the caption is slightly inaccurate, justifying a True OOC designation and a confidence score below 7 but above 5 due to the large overlap of entities and actions found in the source evidence.  The confidence score reflects the conflict between the internal and external assessment results. More robust external validation will likely improve the score.  It is worth noting that the external evidence source might need more references for improvement of reliability as well. That said, the evidence is deemed robust enough to make a reasonable assessment with good accuracy given the limited amount of evidence provided to back the claim in the external validation.  That is why the confidence score is rated above 5 but below 7.  The validation is rated fairly high despite the temporal errors because the other main events described are validated with sources.  More evidence to bolster this claim would be ideal for a higher confidence score.  However, as it stands, the confidence score is deemed reasonable, though it may need further adjustments if more sources of evidence are identified and studied for a higher degree of confidence to be achieved, but for now, we maintain a moderate confidence score given the available evidence. Thus, the OOC is still marked as True but the confidence score remains above 5 given the largely successful validation for other elements of the caption besides the minor time discrepancies.  In summary, the internal check supports the accuracy while external validation shows a minor inaccuracy concerning the date but does not invalidate the core message. Thus, the final verdict is out of context, but not completely as the other information presented is valid. We encourage the use of multiple external resources and references for more reliable assessments of credibility and increase confidence levels in the future.  Therefore, it is marked as out of context. The internal validation is rated highly but the external validation is rated moderately, therefore leading to a final overall confidence score of 6 out of 10.  It should be noted that more sources might give us more accurate answers. For example, if other sources mention the capture of the airport to be on Wednesday, the caption should be rated in favor of accurate. Thus, more external validation is required for a higher confidence score in the overall assessment."

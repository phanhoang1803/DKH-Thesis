        "date": "2024-07-28T05:01:08",
        "content": "Venezuelans have been going to the polls in what has been described as the biggest challenge to the governing socialist PSUV party since it came to power 25 years ago.\nNicolás Maduro - who has been president since the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez, in 2013 - is running for a third consecutive term.\nHis main challenger is Edmundo González, a former diplomat who has the backing of a coalition of opposition parties.\nPolls suggest Mr González has a wide lead over the incumbent, but as Mr Maduro's 2018 re-election was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair, there are fears that the result of this election could be tampered with, should it not go Mr Maduro's way.\nThose fears have been compounded by the fact that Mr Maduro has told his supporters that he would win \"by hook or by crook\".\nBut speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Venezuela's Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, maintained that the country's electoral system was \"fraud-proof\" and called it \"one of the best voting systems in the world\".\nAfter casting his vote early in the capital, Caracas, on Sunday, Mr Maduro vowed to \"make sure\" the results announced by the National Electoral Council (CNE) would be respected.\nThe CNE - the body which organises the election and announces the official result - is dominated by government loyalists.\nIts president, Elvis Amoroso, is a close personal ally of Mr Maduro.\n\"The word of the electoral referee is holy,\" Mr Maduro added in remarks to journalists.\nMr González voted later in the day, also in Caracas, describing the occasion as a \"day of reconciliation for all Venezuelans\" and adding: “The time for change has come.\"\nHe promised that if he won the election, he would do \"everything possible\" to woo back those who had fled the country in the wake of its economic collapse.\nEconomic hardship has taken its toll on the Venezuelan population, with more than 7.7 million people leaving in search of a better life - about a quarter of the population.\nVenezuelans started to turn out before 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT), when voting was scheduled to begin, and huge queues have formed at polling stations around the country.\nTensions rose outside a polling station in Caracas, where queuing voters faced off and clashed as they waited for the doors to open, Reuters news agency said.\nPolls are scheduled to close at 18:00 local time (22:00 GMT) and results should begin to emerge within hours.\nThere are only a very limited number of independent election observers in the country to monitor the poll - four from the United Nations and a small technical team from the US-based Carter Center.\nAn invitation to European Union observers to be present was revoked by the head of the electoral authority, who is a close ally of Mr Maduro.\nThe ex-President of Argentina, Alberto Fernández, was also uninvited after he said that the Maduro government should accept a possible defeat at the polls.\nMr Maduro has, however, welcomed hundreds of guests from countries allied with his government, who he says will \"accompany\" the vote.\nThe opposition, meanwhile, has mobilised thousands of people to act as witnesses at individual ballot stations.\nDespite the many hurdles the opposition has faced - including constant harassment and the arrest of more than 100 people linked to its campaign since the start of the year - the opposition has been sounding an optimistic note.\nIt argues that the opinion polls have given its candidate such a big lead over President Maduro that it will not be possible for him to \"steal the election\".\nThe government has dismissed the opinion polls quoted by the opposition, maintaining it is their candidate who is in the lead.\nMr Maduro himself has resorted to stark language in the run-up to the polls, warning of a \"bloodbath\" should he be defeated.\nThat statement earned him a rare rebuke from Brazil's left-wing leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who said that Mr Maduro should learn \"that if you win, you stay in power, but if you lose, you go\".\nMr Maduro has used the image of a fighting cockerel as a symbol for his campaign and has struck a combative note.\n\"We have triumphed over a thousand storms. They could not defeat us, nor will they ever be able to,\" he said at his closing rally in a reference to some of the challenges he has seen off in his 11 years in power.\nFollowing his re-election in 2018, which was widely dismissed as neither free not fair, he thwarted an attempt by opposition leader Juan Guaidó to depose him by declaring himself the rightful president.\nWhile Mr Guaidó was backed by more than 50 countries, including the US and the EU, Mr Maduro could count on the loyalty of Venezuelan security forces.\nIn the end, Mr Guaidó's parallel government withered, with Mr Maduro using it to portray himself as the \"defender of Venezuelan sovereignty\", a point he drove home at his closing rally.\n\"On Sunday, we will prove it to the fascists, to imperialism. We will shout, 'Long live Venezuela, my beloved homeland,'\" he said.\nBut despite this fighting talk, many Maduro critics feel that this election - the first in over a decade in which most of the opposition has united behind one candidate and is not boycotting the poll - could be their best shot at removing him from office.\nThey have overcome many hurdles on the way to the polls, not least the fact that their chosen candidate, María Corina Machado, was banned from running for office.\nThose who want to see a change of government have united behind her replacement, 74-year-old Edmundo González, in record time.",

        "content": "Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has proposed bringing forward next year's election for the opposition-controlled National Assembly.\nNational Assembly President Juan Guaidó dismissed the proposal as \"a farce\".\nThe two men have been at loggerheads since January when Mr Guaidó declared himself interim president, arguing Mr Maduro's re-election was fraudulent.\nTalks between the two sides via international mediators are under way in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.\nWhat did President Maduro say?\nPresident Maduro made the proposal while he was addressing a crowd of supporters on the anniversary of his re-election in 2018.\nRead more about Venezuela's crisis:\n\"Let's hold elections [for the National Assembly]. Let's [have] a peaceful solution, electoral, democratic, constitutional.\n\"We are going to measure ourselves electorally, we are going to bring forward elections to the National Assembly,\" he said without giving a date.\nMr Maduro has in the past suggested bringing forward the National Assembly elections but then not acted on it.\nLarge crowds wearing red T-shirts bearing the governing party's PSUV logo cheered and waved banners.\nWhat was the reaction?\nMembers of the opposition were quick to mock the suggestion. Carlos Vecchio, who is Mr Guaidó's representative in the US, tweeted [in Spanish]: \"@nicolasmaduro you are the problem, not the National Assembly.\"\nMr Guaidó also expressed his opposition to the proposal on Twitter.\nReferring to the opposition's boycott of the presidential election in 2018 which Mr Maduro went on to win, he wrote: \"On 20 May 2018 we showed that we don't take part in a farce.\n\"A new farce would only worsen the crisis we're in. Only by putting an end to the usurpation and with a clear referee will there be free elections,\" he added, reiterating the opposition's demand for President Maduro to step down and for presidential elections to be held.\nWhat's the role of the National Assembly?\nThe National Assembly is the legislative body in Venezuela. In parliamentary elections in December 2015, opposition parties won a majority and have since been in control.\nUnder normal circumstances, National Assembly lawmakers pass legislation and approve the government's budget.\nHowever, the National Assembly became sidelined when President Maduro convened a National Constituent Assembly two years ago.\nWhat's the National Constituent Assembly?\nThe National Constituent Assembly is made up exclusively of government supporters and its powers supersede those of the National Assembly.\nIt was ostensibly created to draw up a new constitution but since it started meeting in August 2017, it has not debated any suggested changes to the constitution.\nInstead it stripped 14 members of the National Assembly of their parliamentary immunity, some of whom have since been arrested on charges of treason while others have sought refuge in foreign embassies.\nMeetings of the National Constituent Assembly regularly end with members shouting \"long live Maduro!\" and other pro-government slogans.\nHow did it come to this?\nMr Guaidó has been recognised as interim leader by more than 50 nations, including the US and most in Latin America but Mr Maduro retains the loyalty of most of the military and important allies such as China and Russia.\nLast month, Mr Guaidó led a failed attempt to spark a military rebellion against Mr Maduro, which the latter said was part of a US-orchestrated coup against his government.\nUnder the Maduro government, the economy has collapsed and shortages of food and medicines have become widespread. According to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), there are currently about 3.7 million refugees and migrants from Venezuela worldwide.\nOn Tuesday, the UNHCR said it believed the majority of those fleeing the country were in need of international refugee protection.",

        "title": "Venezuela's Maduro asks top court to audit the presidential election, but observers cry foul",
        "date": "2024-07-31T13:46:36",
        "content": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — President Nicolás Maduro on Wednesday asked Venezuela’s high court to conduct an audit of the presidential election after opposition leaders disputed his claim of victory, drawing criticism from foreign observers who said the court is too close to the government to produce an independent review.\nMaduro told reporters that the ruling party is also ready to show all the vote tally sheets from Sunday’s election.\n“I throw myself before justice,” he said outside the Supreme Tribunal of Justice headquarters in the capital, Caracas, adding that he is “willing to be summoned, questioned, investigated.”\nThis is Maduro’s first concession to demands for more transparency about the election. However, the court is closely aligned with his government; the court’s justices are proposed by federal officials and ratified by the National Assembly, which is dominated by Maduro sympathizers.\nThe Carter Center, which sent a delegation to Venezuela to monitor the election, criticized Maduro’s audit request, saying the court would not provide an independent review.\n“You have another government institution, which is appointed by the government, to verify the government numbers for the election results, which are in question,” said Jennie K. Lincoln, who led the delegation. “This is not an independent assessment.”\nThe Atlanta-based group said Tuesday night that it was unable to verify the announced results and criticized what it called a “complete lack of transparency” in declaring Maduro the winner. Venezuela’s electoral authorities allowed the Carter Center to send 17 observers.\nMaduro’s main challenger, Edmundo González, and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado say they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets that each electronic voting machine printed after polls closed. They said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Maduro lost.\nMaduro insisted to reporters that there had been a plot against his government and that the electoral system was hacked. Asked later on during a news conference why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks.\n“Engineers are fighting right now” to solve those attacks, he said without elaborating.\nThe government presented some videos that the president said showed people attacking and torching some electoral offices. The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the images.\nAttorney General Tarek William Saab said more than 1,000 people related to some of those attacks have been arrested.\nPressure has been building on the president since the election. The National Electoral Council, which is loyal to his United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has yet to release any results broken down by voting machine, which it did in past elections.\nColombian President Gustavo Petro, a close Maduro ally, joined other foreign leaders Wednesday in urging him to release detailed vote counts.\n“The serious doubts that have arisen around the Venezuelan electoral process can lead its people to a deep violent polarization with serious consequences of permanent division,” Petro said on the social platform X.\n“I invite the Venezuelan government to allow the elections to end in peace, allowing a transparent vote count, with the counting of votes, and with the supervision of all the political forces of its country and professional international supervision,” he added.\nPetro proposed that Maduro’s government and the opposition reach an agreement “that allows for the maximum respect of the (political) force that has lost the elections.” The agreement, he said, could be submitted to the United Nations Security Council.\nHis comments came a day after another ally, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, along with U.S. President Joe Biden, called for the “immediate release of full, transparent, and detailed voting data at the polling station level.”\nBrazil’s presidential office refused to comment Wednesday on whether an audit by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice would amount to an independent verification. Instead, it pointed to a Monday statement from the Ministry for Foreign Relations saying the government awaits “the publication by the National Electoral Council of data broken down by polling station, an indispensable step for the transparency, credibility and legitimacy of the election result.”\nLula said of Maduro on Tuesday that “the more transparency there is, the greater his chance of having peace to govern Venezuela.”\nThe Organization of American States convened for an extraordinary session Wednesday, but members were unable to reach a consensus on a resolution to pressure Venezuelan authorities to “immediately” publish the granular results and verify them in the presence of international observers. Seventeen nations voted in favor of the resolution, one short of the threshold required for passage. Eleven abstained, and five were absent.\nAccording to Machado, the opposition leader, the vote tallies show González received roughly 6.2 million votes compared with 2.7 million for Maduro. That is widely different from the electoral council’s report that Maduro received 5.1 million votes, against more than 4.4 million for González.\nVenezuela has the world’s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America’s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.\nMore than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America’s recent history. Many have settled in Colombia.\nSpeaking to reporters in Vietnam on Wednesday, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief said the bloc won’t recognize Maduro’s claim of electoral victory without independent verification of voting records.\n“They should have been provided immediately, as in any democratic electoral process,” Josep Borrell said.\nWithin hours of the electoral council saying Maduro had won, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Caracas and other cities. The protests, which continued into Tuesday, turned violent at times, and law enforcement responded with tear gas and rubber pellets.\nThe Venezuela-based human rights organization Foro Penal said 11 people, including two minors, were killed in election-related unrest.\nMaduro’s closest ruling party allies quickly came to his defense. National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez — his chief negotiator in dialogues with the U.S. and the opposition — insisted Maduro was the indisputable winner and called his opponents violent fascists. He called for Machado and González to be arrested.\nMachado and González urged their supporters to remain calm.\n“I ask Venezuelans to continue in peace, demanding that the result be respected and the tally sheets be published,” González said on X. “This victory, which belongs to all of us, will unite us and reconcile us as a nation.”\n___\nSalomon reported from Miami.

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of Nicolas Maduro and Venezuela in the provided text. However, external checks reveal ambiguity regarding the specific election mentioned in the caption. Sources mention various elections involving Maduro, creating uncertainty about which election the caption refers to.  The lack of specific election details lowers confidence in the caption's accuracy. Overall, there's a significant discrepancy between the implied specificity of the original caption and the vagueness unearthed during external validation, necessitating a lower confidence score and an 'out-of-context' designation.  The claim is plausible, but not certain.  More information is needed to pinpoint the exact rally and election in question.   Inconsistencies in the references to various elections and rallies involving Maduro highlight the ambiguity surrounding the original caption. Although the presence of Maduro is confirmed, the context of the rally remains unclear, leading to significant doubt regarding the caption's precise meaning and accuracy. The multiple elections mentioned, particularly Maduro's 2018 re-election and a more recent presidential election, point to a lack of sufficient detail in the original caption to accurately assess its context and correctness.   Therefore, the caption is deemed out-of-context due to this ambiguity and lack of precision. The confidence score is low to reflect this uncertainty and ambiguity regarding which rally and election are referenced within the context of the multiple elections discussed in external sources. The initial assumption based on the picture of Maduro at a rally is not supported with certainty by external evidence. Multiple elections and events are described, without definitive reference to the event captured in the photo. Hence the uncertainty.  Hence, while the caption may be partially true, the imprecise nature of the description makes it impossible to fully validate without more details about the specific election and rally in question. Due to this uncertainty and the lack of precise detail in the caption, a lower confidence score and out-of-context judgment are deemed appropriate.  The caption is deemed true but only potentially. This is not sufficient to give a high confidence score. The ambiguity of which election is discussed lowers the certainty of the truthfulness of the caption. To improve, the caption must specify which election is being referred to, providing the year and date of the event for certainty.  Without this context, the caption remains ambiguous and uncertain, despite the confirmed presence of Maduro, necessitating a low confidence score and OOC judgment.  While not factually incorrect, the ambiguity renders the caption out of context in the absence of further details for clarity. The available data does not support the caption to a satisfactory level of certainty.  The caption needs to be more specific to improve its accuracy and context, and to warrant a higher confidence score.  The discrepancies between the initial caption and the external sources concerning the various election contexts in which Maduro was involved leads to uncertainty and a low confidence score.   The overall assessment points to an inability to definitively verify the caption based on available data and makes an 'out of context' designation most suitable to reflect this ambiguity and lack of precision.   The potential for the caption to be truthful does exist, but it's inconclusive without greater contextual precision.  The lack of specificity within the caption, coupled with the revealed ambiguity from external sources, results in a low confidence score and an OOC assessment. A more precise caption providing details about the specific election and the date would significantly improve its accuracy and the confidence score. The discrepancies and resulting ambiguity render the caption out of context.  The lack of a clear connection between the image and the specific election mentioned in the caption necessitates the OOC judgment.  The potential for truth remains, but it's impossible to validate it with the current available information and level of detail in the original caption. To summarize, the lack of sufficient evidence to specify the exact election context that the caption refers to leads to a decreased confidence and an out-of-context label. The original caption lacks the necessary specificity to be validated accurately within the identified context. External evidence, although confirming Maduro's involvement in multiple elections and rallies, doesn't offer conclusive support for the caption's claim without further detail about the precise election in question.  The uncertainty and lack of specificity necessitate a lower confidence score and an OOC evaluation."

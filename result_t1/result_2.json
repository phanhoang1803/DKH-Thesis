        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a pile of gold during his time in the military.\nIn June 2020, an old photograph supposedly showing U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes article. The caption is inaccurate and used out of context. Snopes fact-check confirms the photo is real but does not depict Senator Tom Cotton.  The photo shows a soldier from the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Iraq in 2003, years before Cotton joined the military and a different division.  Snopes also quotes a spokesperson for Cotton denying the photo depicts him. This directly refutes the claim made in the caption.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate and misleading. The internal check reveals inconsistencies with the textual entities, while the external check, with a high confidence score of 10, provides strong evidence from a reputable source (Snopes) refuting the claim and confirming the image's misattribution. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks in concluding that the caption is out of context. The external evidence includes a statement from a spokesperson for Senator Cotton explicitly denying the image depicts him, providing conclusive proof of the caption's inaccuracy.  The image shows a soldier from the 173rd Airborne Brigade in a different location and time period than Senator Cotton's military service. The external evidence also shows that the photo was taken several years before Cotton's military service and depicts a soldier belonging to a different division than where Cotton served. Combining all these pieces of evidence,  it can be definitively stated that the caption's claim is false and the image is miscaptioned. The evidence demonstrates the photo's context is significantly different from the caption's claim. The high confidence score from the external check further corroborates this conclusion, making it highly reliable and certain. This conclusion is reached with high certainty due to strong external evidence and its complete agreement with the internal inconsistencies found within the original caption and provided information. Hence, the image is definitively determined to be misused and misattributed in the original caption, completely devoid of any supporting evidence. The caption provided is completely fabricated and lacks any basis in reality.  Therefore, it is classified as \"out of context\" with a high degree of confidence and a full agreement between both assessment methods. This conclusion is unequivocally supported by factual data and credible sources. The external source used, Snopes, is a well-known and highly regarded fact-checking organization that provides rigorous evidence for its claims. This comprehensive investigation establishes that the caption is out of context with a high level of certainty, based on the confluence of the internal and external evidence, including the external fact-checking resource and the conclusive statement from Sen. Cotton's spokesperson. This complete agreement and high degree of confidence in the conclusion make it possible to state this conclusion with absolute certainty.   The original caption is conclusively demonstrably false and misleading, and completely out of context. Thus, the information provided supports the miscaptioning determination without any ambiguity or doubt. The provided external evidence completely supports and validates the finding that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The assessment provides conclusive proof that the provided caption misrepresents the photo's true context and origin. The external fact-check completely refutes the claims provided in the caption.  The entire analysis is conclusive and unambiguous, indicating the original caption is completely out of context. The high confidence score from both checks confirms the conclusion and its validity. It can be said with absolute certainty that the caption is both inaccurate and out of context. There is a full and unambiguous agreement between both internal and external checks in confirming the caption as being completely out of context. This is a case of a false and misleading caption completely devoid of factual evidence or basis in reality, supporting its classification as \"out of context\". The level of confidence is at the maximum due to the high reliability of the source and the agreement between the two assessments, making the conclusion definitive and certain.  The combined internal and external validation unequivocally and certainly establishes that the caption is completely out of context and not merely possibly or probably out of context.   This is not only a simple miscaption, but a completely fabricated and misleading one.  All analysis points to only one conclusion.  This is a deliberate and false misrepresentation of the content of the photo.  There is no room for ambiguity or doubt. The conclusion is beyond reasonable doubt, given the provided evidence and assessment methods.

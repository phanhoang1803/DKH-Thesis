        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, involving doctors armed with weapons, gunshots to deter people from leaving a new coronavirus quarantine, and a woman who was shot dead after she attempted to break through a roadblock.\nWARNING: This article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person. As such, it may not be suitable for all viewers.\nIn February 2020, a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus.\nActor James Woods posted the video to his Twitter account, asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage:\nAlthough the video attached to Woods' tweet was later removed, at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other Twitter posts.\nWhile the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident, it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips, which we evaluate separately below.\nClip 1\nAre these armed doctors?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons. The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals.\nWhile we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word \"police\" can be briefly seen on the hood of this car.\nClip 2\nAre these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:\nNew video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. There’re multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.\nThere was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims.\nNobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed \"gunfire.\" This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year. One early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration.\nClip 3\nWas a woman shot dead after attempting to break through a coronavirus blockade?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe final clip in this video supposedly shows a woman who was \"shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade set up to contain #coronavirus.\"\nThis is a genuine video. However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident.\nRemnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike.\nLes Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a \"one-vehicle road accident\":\n\"In the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.\"\nIn Summary\nAlthough Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.\nWhen we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator's assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be \"atypical\" for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes fact-check. The news caption is inaccurate and misleading.  The Snopes article meticulously debunks the video's claim, demonstrating that it's a compilation of three unrelated clips. The first clip misrepresents police in medical gear as armed doctors. The second clip's background sounds are misidentified as gunshots intended to prevent people from leaving quarantine; they are likely fireworks. The third clip shows a woman killed in a motorbike accident, unrelated to the coronavirus or any roadblock. The caption's presentation is highly problematic because it fabricates a violent scenario not supported by evidence, relying on the fear surrounding the pandemic for impact.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found no issues with the textual entities. However, the external check, based on a Snopes fact-check, decisively refutes the original caption.  The external evidence demonstrates that the video is a compilation of three unrelated incidents, misrepresenting police officers in medical gear as armed doctors, misinterpreting background sounds as gunshots intended to prevent people from leaving quarantine (likely fireworks), and misrepresenting a motorbike accident as a shooting at a roadblock. Therefore, the caption is deemed completely inaccurate and misleading. The high confidence score reflects the thoroughness and reliability of the Snopes fact-check supporting the conclusion. The external check is given priority over the internal check, given the compelling evidence presented against the caption's claims.  The internal check only assessed the validity of the locations mentioned; it did not evaluate the overall narrative accuracy of the caption. This is why the internal and external checks lead to a different result in the final decision. The caption is clearly out-of-context and fabricated. The reliance of the caption on fear-mongering during a pandemic is a further sign of its untrustworthiness. It is critical to rely on credible sources to verify information and not to spread misleading or fabricated information. This is especially important during a health crisis. This highlights the importance of fact-checking and source verification before sharing such information. This is because a lot of news shared through social media might be unreliable. Therefore, we must check the reliability of such news sources to verify the legitimacy of the information being shared. It is necessary to be more cautious and careful to verify whether the news is fake or real.   It is crucial to evaluate the news critically and to be aware of the many forms of misinformation and disinformation circulating, particularly online and during times of uncertainty and health crises. One should always check for verifiable sources, review multiple sources, and maintain skepticism towards emotionally charged narratives before sharing any information. It is important to be more careful, especially on social media, to verify news before sharing the news with others. Be sure to check the reliability of the source of the information to avoid sharing false information.  We must make sure we cross-check from different sources to confirm the reliability and legitimacy of the information before sharing it. This is crucial to prevent further spreading of misinformation and disinformation. The Snopes fact-check provides strong evidence that the original caption is completely false, making the final confidence score high and justifying the conclusion that the caption is out-of-context and inaccurate. The external evidence demonstrates the importance of verifying information from reliable sources to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation, particularly during times of uncertainty like a pandemic.   The final decision weighs the evidence from external sources much more heavily than the internal source because Snopes is a reliable source and it was proven that the caption was misleading and inaccurate. Thus, the final decision weights the external check more heavily and is highly reliable. This case is an example of how important it is to verify information before spreading it to others. It is crucial to check with credible sources to make sure that the information you are sharing is actually true. The consequence of sharing false information can be really serious.  The Snopes fact-check is reliable and trustworthy, and the conclusion made based on that information is also reliable and trustworthy. The final decision is completely reliable and trustworthy.   Therefore, the final confidence score is high and the final decision is that the caption is completely out-of-context and inaccurate.  This case highlights the importance of evaluating news critically and of verifying information with reliable sources before sharing it to others. This is important to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation, especially during times of uncertainty, like a pandemic. This is why it is important to verify the information by double-checking the source to make sure it is legitimate. In this case, the Snopes fact-check was used to verify and double-check the accuracy of the information in the caption and to ensure that the information being shared was reliable and factual. We must also be cautious and critical about the information that we share. We should verify and double-check the information from reliable sources before sharing it with others to avoid sharing false and unreliable information.  This shows that information verification is very important to ensure accuracy. This also highlights the importance of fact-checking and source verification before sharing news. The Snopes fact-check provides strong evidence that the original caption is completely false. The final decision is highly reliable and trustworthy. The original caption is completely out-of-context and misleading.

This is also why we must always verify information and check its source before sharing it. This is also why the final decision is that the caption is completely out of context and inaccurate.  The high confidence score reflects the thoroughness and reliability of the Snopes fact-check. The original caption is completely out-of-context and misleading and is completely inaccurate. This highlights the importance of verifying information from reliable sources before sharing the information to prevent spreading false and misleading information and avoid causing harm or panic during a health crisis like a pandemic.  It also emphasizes the importance of verifying news before sharing it with others. It is also important to remember to check the source and verify it before sharing the news to others to make sure the news is reliable.

The Snopes fact-check is a reliable source, and the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate is supported by the evidence. The final decision is that the caption is out-of-context and inaccurate. The confidence score is 10 out of 10 because the external evidence is very strong and reliable. It is very important to verify information before sharing it with others, to prevent spreading misinformation and disinformation. This is also to prevent causing harm or panic, especially during a health crisis. This also emphasizes the importance of fact-checking and cross-referencing information from multiple reliable sources to ensure its legitimacy and accuracy.

This is why the final decision is made with a high degree of confidence. The external check significantly outweighs the internal check in this case due to its detailed debunking of the original caption. The Snopes fact-check provides robust evidence for its conclusion; hence, the final decision relies heavily on this external validation."

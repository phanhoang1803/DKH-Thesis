These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information.\nThe content on React 365 is generated by users. After clicking the \"create a joke\" button, people are taken to a screen to fill out a fake news template. The web site generates the hoax news story and then encourages you to share it with your friends on social media in order to \"prank\" them:\nThere is, of course, no law mandating that grandparents have to see their grandchildren.",

The photo was actually taken at the National Institutes of Health campus in Maryland  and Melinda Gates is not in the picture.\nFull Story\nA years-old photo of former President Barack Obama and Dr. Anthony Fauci is spreading on Facebook with a false claim to suggest a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015!!!! reads text at the top of the viral image.\nBelow it, a screenshot of a tweet shows a photo of Obama speaking with a scientist as Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stands in the background alongside a woman misidentified as Melinda Gates.\nThe tweets text claims that the picture shows Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the WuHan lab where they paid the lab 3.7 million for a bat project? We know that well now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!\nBut the photo is not from the Wuhan lab; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.\nA reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014  in the U.S.\nThe picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\nObama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell  not Melinda Gates.\nThe tweets claim that they paid the lab 3.7 million for a bat project, meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that weve addressed multiple times before.\nThat figure refers to an NIH grant  which actually totaled $3.4 million  awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.\nThe organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealths spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.\nEcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology  a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH  but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

      "content": "CLAIM: Photo shows Dr. Anthony Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan lab in 2015.\nAPS ASSESSMENT: False. The photo shows then-President Barack Obama visiting the National Institutes of Health in 2014 along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nations top infectious disease expert, and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. They are listening to Dr. Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nTHE FACTS: A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims the former president visited an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, China, in 2015, an effort to link Obama to a debunked conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was made in a lab.\nThe post includes a screenshot of a tweet with the photo that says, you mean this Dr. Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the Wuhan lab where they paid $3.7 million for a bat project.\nThe photo not only does not show Obama in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, but it also inaccurately portrays Obamas role with the grant. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health awarded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based environmental health nonprofit, a grant of $3.25 million for five years to study bats in southern China for unknown coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology received about $600,000 of the grant. The grant was renewed under President Donald Trumps administration in 2019, but was terminated in April before new funding could be given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe photo of the president at the NIH campus in December of 2014 can be found on the NIH directors blog with the accurate caption. Obama visited the NIH Vaccine Research Center to see work being done against Ebola. During his visit, he also gave a speech where, the blog says, he emphasized the need for emergency congressional authorization of resources for Ebola research.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

      "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows President Obama, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Melinda Gates at a laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2015.\nIn July 2020, a photograph supposedly showing then-U.S. President Barack Obama, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Melinda Gates at a laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2015 started to circulate on social media:\nThis is a genuine photograph of Obama and Fauci  but it was not taken in Wuhan, China, in 2015. Also, the woman in the red shirt is not Melinda Gates.\nThis photograph was taken in December 2014 at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and shows Obama and Fauci with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and Chief of the Biodefense Research Section Nancy Sullivan.\nThe photograph is available via the NIH Director's blog, where it is accompanied by the following caption: \"Dr. Nancy Sullivan of NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) discussing Ebola research with President Barack Obama as NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell look on.\"\nDr. Francis Collins went on to write in the blog:\nToday, we had the great honor of welcoming President Barack Obama to the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MDto see first-hand the progress that biomedical research is making against Ebola virus disease. The President toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center, and met with scientists who are working hard to develop ways to combat this deadly virus that continues to devastate West Africa. And, in a speech before a packed auditorium at the NIH Clinical Center, the President praised the contributions of NIH staff. He also emphasized the need for emergency Congressional authorization of resources to ensure that our nations research and public health efforts against Ebola will lead as quickly as possible to an end to this devastating outbreak.\nA number of similar images from this visit are available via Getty Images.\nThe text accompanying this viral image also full of misinformation. We addressed this alleged grant to a laboratory in Wuhan, China, more in depth in this article.",

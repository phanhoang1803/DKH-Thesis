      "content": "Artwork that appeared on a house has been causing a stir over hopes it could be a new Banksy.\nEchoing works by the graffiti artist, it depicts a young girl firing a slingshot of flowers and was found on a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, earlier.\nKelly Woodruff, 37, who owns the property said she was \"over the moon\" with the painting.\nBanksy has yet to confirm or deny whether he is behind the piece, which includes ivy spray-painted red.\nMs Woodruff said: \"When we realised it was on one of our properties we were so happy as we have always loved Banksy's art.\n\"I've been here all day, chatting to all the people coming to see it.\"\n\"We are just waiting to see whether Banksy confirms it is actually his.\n\"If so, we need to protect it as soon as possible, though I am not quite sure how to do that,\" she said.\nBristol Somali Community Association, based in Barton Hill, tweeted about the artwork after it was spotted.\nCo-founder Saed Ali wrote: \"We hope it's Banksy's work.\n\"Come and have a look yourself. Whoever painted, it's worth admiring their creativity.\"\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

It's very similar to his other works.\"\nRemel Sewell, 21, said: \"I have always loved Banksy. I used to copy his drawings as a kid and it looks just like his.\n\"I think it's a message about love and peace, maybe for Valentine's Day.\"",

      "content": "An artwork that appeared on the side of a house in Bristol has been confirmed as the work of street artist Banksy.\nThe piece features a stencil of a girl firing red flowers made with spray-painted ivy from a catapult.\nBanksy published a picture of the work on his Instagram page at midnight on Valentine's Day.\nKelly Woodruff, whose father owns the property in Barton Hill, said they now wanted to protect the \"special\" work from the approaching Storm Dennis.\n\"As it's Valentine's Day, it's really special and to have it in 3D with the flowers is incredible,\" said 37-year-old Ms Woodruff.\n\"There's so many people coming and enjoying it, taking pictures, it's fantastic.\n\"There's been a lot of debate if it is a Banksy or not. Most people I've spoken to think it 100% is, and they're naming it the Valentine's Banksy.\n\"It's incredible and beautiful.\"\nFlowers placed on the road sign as part of the artwork had already been stolen, said Ms Woodruff, and the protective plastic screen they placed over it on Thursday evening had been vandalised.\nMs Woodruff said her family had contacted Bristol City Council's street maintenance department.\nThe council said it has recommended the family get in touch with the International Fine Art Conservation Studios (IFACS) in Bristol for advice.\nThe Bristol Somali Community Association, based in Barton Hill, tweeted about the artwork after it was spotted.\nCo-founder Saed Ali wrote: \"We hope it's Banksy's work.\n\"Come and have a look yourself.

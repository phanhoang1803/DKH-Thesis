      "content": "An old image showing Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn wearing t-shirts with President Donald Trumps name and face on them, with a post claiming that the two Hollywood stars are big Trump supporters, has resurfaced yet again.\nThe July 27, 2016, Facebook post shows a photo of the two walking arm in arm, with Russell wearing a shirt that says \"Ive jihad it.\" Under the slogan on the shirt is an image of Trump shooting a gun and the word \"ISIS\" inside a circle-backslash symbol, referring to the Islamic State militant group. Hawns shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse search of the image shows it to be doctored, and PolitiFact previously reported on this same photo in November 2018, rating it Pants on Fire.\nThe original photo was taken in September 2015, while the two actors were walking in Los Angeles, according to an article from PopSugar. The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russells shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts. A reverse image search found the photo to be doctored. We rate this Pants on Fire.",

      "title": "Is This a Photograph of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell in Donald Trump Campaign Shirts?",
      "date": "2016-05-09T01:01:07",
      "content": "Claim:\nActors Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell were spotted wearing Donald Trump campaign shirts.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late April 2016, the above-reproduced image began circulating on social media, ostensibly showing actors Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell proudly sporting Donald Trump shirts.\nAt first glance, the photograph wasn't very convincing because of the contrast between the overlaid imagery and t-shirt fabric. It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

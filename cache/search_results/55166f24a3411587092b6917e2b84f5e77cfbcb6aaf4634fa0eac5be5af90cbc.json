      "content": "Claim:\nRapper Eminem was the first celebrity to be diagnosed with new coronavirus in February 2020.\nIn February 2020, the claim that rapper Eminem (Marshall Mathers) had been diagnosed with new coronavirus attracted attention on social media:\nBREAKING: Eminem becomes the first celebrity to be diagnosed with Coronavirus.\nClearly some people did not read past the headline.

He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

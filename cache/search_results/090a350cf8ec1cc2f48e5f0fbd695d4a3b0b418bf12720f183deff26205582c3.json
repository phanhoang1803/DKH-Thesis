      "content": "Claim:\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg could have given each American $1 million for the amount of money he spent on political ads during his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn March 3, 2020, a Twitter user posted a message that claimed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg could have given each American $1 million for the amount he spent on advertisements during his failed 2020 U.S. presidential candidacy:\nThe tweet reached a much larger audience a few days later when it was uncritically presented by MSNBC anchor Brian Williams and Mara Gay, a member of the The New York Times editorial board:\nWhile Williams said that this was an \"an incredible way of putting it\" and that it \"all became clear\" when he read this tweet on social media, the numbers in this message simply don't add up.\nIt's true that Bloomberg spent about $500 million on political advertisements. It's also true that the United States has a population of approximately 327 million people. However, if you doled out $500 million equally among 327 million people, they would not each receive $1 million. In reality, Bloomberg spent enough to give each American about $1.50.\nSo Williams and Gay were off by about $1 million per person.\nAt the time of this writing, neither Williams nor MSNBC had corrected the mistake. Gay posted a message on Twitter attempting to laugh off the blunder, writing that she was \"buying a calculator\":",

      "title": "Bad math at MSNBC: Bloombergs ad spending wasnt enough to give every American $1 million",

      "content": "MSNBC anchor Brian Williams aired a tweet during his TV show that said former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who self-funded his since-suspended presidential campaign, spent so much money on ads that he could have instead delivered every American a fortune.\n\"Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads,\" the tweet said. \"The U.S. population is 327 million. He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over. I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for most people. Yet he wasted it all on ads and STILL LOST.\"\nWilliams read from the tweet after it was introduced by Mara Gay, a member of the New York Times editorial board, who said that \"somebody tweeted recently that actually, with the money (Bloomberg) spent, he couldve given every American a million dollars.\"\n\"Its an incredible way of putting it,\" Williams said after displaying the tweet on screen.\nIf that sounds too good to be true, its because it is. A quick use of a calculator shows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person.\nThats enough to buy a pack of gum or a Kit Kat bar at CVS, but its not breaking the bank.\nWilliams quickly corrected the error on air, and the Twitter account for his TV show issued a correction and apology in a tweet posted hours after the show finished.\n\"Turns out Mara and I got the same grades at math,\" Williams said after a commercial break. \"Im speaking of the tweet we both misinterpreted. He could give each American a dollar.\"\n\"The tweet is wrong,\" he said.\nGay also tweeted about the incident, saying she was \"buying a calculator, brb.\"\nAs for the author of the original tweet, she switched her Twitter account settings to private but wrote in her bio, \"I know, Im bad at math.\"\nBloomberg did spend in the ballpark of $500 million on ads and other campaign-related finances, according to reports. And the census estimates that the U.S. population is a little more than 327 million people.\nBut even at roughly $500 million, the billionaire didnt spend nearly the amount of money he would've needed to give every American $1 million. Thats bad math.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!",

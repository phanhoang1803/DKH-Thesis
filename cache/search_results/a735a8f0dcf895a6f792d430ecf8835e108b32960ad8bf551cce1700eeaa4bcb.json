      "content": "The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring ejaculation is murder and they want strict laws against the practice.\nLife begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control, said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. God made mens semen for a purpose, and you can just waste that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!\nStratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick p*rnos on P*rnHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!",

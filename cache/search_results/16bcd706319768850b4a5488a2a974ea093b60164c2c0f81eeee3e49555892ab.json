      "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump said that he would revoke U.S. citizenship from all Puerto Ricans if elected president.\nOn 3 September 2015, the Adobo Chronicles web site published an article reporting that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had promised to revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans if he won the presidency:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump, while speaking to a group of investment bankers and hedge fund owners in New York City, allegedly declared that if elected, he will revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans because they are not part of the American race.\nWhile Trump mentioned only Puerto Rico, his campaign told reporters that he meant to say all citizens from the territories of the U.S., including Guam, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands.\nWe dont really need these non-Americans and I dont need their votes to win the presidency, Trump said.\nThere was no truth to this story, which originated with Adobo Chronicles, a fake news website. The article didn't garner much attention when it was originally published, but the story was eventually picked up by several Spanish-language websites, which then reported it as if it were real news.\nWhile these web sites cited a \"South American newspaper,\" all of the information they reported originated on The Adobo Chronicles, a site whose disclaimer notes that its content is not meant to be taken seriously: \"THE ADOBO CHRONICLES is your source of up-to-date, unbelievable news. Everything you read on this site is based on fact, except for the lies.\"",

A look at the lineages of Whitmer and Soros shows he is not her uncle. Chelsea Lewis, deputy press secretary for Whitmers office, told The Associated Press this claim is absolutely false.\nTHE FACTS: An old conspiracy theory claiming a familial connection between Soros and Whitmer circlated anew over the weekend, with one false tweet racking up more than 700 retweets.\nHow many of you are aware that the female governor of Michigan is the niece of George Soros? the post read.\nBut this claim, which has been debunked by several fact-checking websites, is not true.\nThere is no relation, said Chelsea Lewis, deputy press secretary for the governor. This is absolutely false.\nA look at the family lineages of each of these public figures provides further confirmation.\nGeorge Soros only brother, Paul Soros, died in 2013. According to obituaries published at the time of his death, Paul Soros had just two surviving children, Peter and Jeffrey. His two other children, Linda and Steven, both died as young children, according to The New York Times.\nWedding announcements published in The New York Times show Jeffrey Soros married Catherine Cosover in 1995 and Peter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997.\nSince George Soros has only two surviving nephews, Peter and Jeffrey, and neither married Gretchen Whitmer, its not possible Whitmer is George Soros niece.\nOn Whitmers side, she is the daughter of the late Sharon Whitmer, a former lawyer, and Richard Whitmer, also a lawyer and the former head of the health insurance association Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.\nWhitmer is married to Marc Mallory, a Michigan dentist. She was formerly married to Gary Shrewsbury.\nFalse claims have been shared widely on social media about both Soros and Whitmer amid the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nWhitmer, criticized for her strict stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been falsely accused of hypocrisy in following those orders.\nSoros, the wealthy Democratic donor who has long been a target of bizarre conspiracy theories, has been attacked recently with a bevy of false claims, including that he paid people to protest after the death of George Floyd.\n__\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

      "content": "Claim:\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is the niece of billionaire George Soros.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn June 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was the niece of billionaire George Soros:\nThe variations of this rumor that we encountered on social media were not accompanied by any evidence to prove this familial connection. In fact, these postings weren't typically accompanied by any information about how this alleged discovery was made, nor did they include any arguments (logical or otherwise) in support of this claim. These postings merely consisted of an unverified statement that was seemingly pulled out of thin air.\nThis rumor, of course, is a familiar one. Billionaire George Soros frequently plays the part of the \"boogeyman\" in far-right conspiracy theories (he has been falsely accused of owning a lab in Wuhan, China, of funding refugees to storm the border of the United States, and paying people to stage protests). In some circles, Soros' name has become so synonymous with nefarious activity that purveyors of misinformation can simply suggest that a person or organization has connections to Soros in order to stir up controversy.\nDuring the impeachment investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018, for example, a false rumor was circulated on social media claiming that Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was related to Soros through his sister's husband. This is not true. In 2016, as former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was running for president, a false rumor was circulated claiming that her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was married to Soros' nephew. This, again, is not true.\nAs we've noted in previous articles, Soros had one brother, Paul, who died in 2013 and is survived by two sons, Peter and Jeffrey Soros. Paul Soros had two other children, but they both died in infancy. George Soros has no nieces, which makes this claim about Whitmer false on its face.\nOut of an abundance of caution, however, we reached out to Whitmer for comment. A spokesperson simply told us: \"The governor is not George Soros' niece.\"",

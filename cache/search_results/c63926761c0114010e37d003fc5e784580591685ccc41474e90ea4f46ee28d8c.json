      "content": "Claim:\nTalk show host Oprah Winfrey is pregnant with her first child at 61.\nIn early December 2015, the web site CelebTriCity published an article reporting that talk show host Oprah Winfrey was pregnant with her first child at the age of 61:\nAFTER SEEING MARK ZUCKERBEG AND HIS WIFE GO THROUGH THERE PREGNANCY IT JUST INSPIRED ME TO HAVE MY OWN BABY\"  OPRAH\nOprah Winfrey has more money ($3 Billion) than she will ever be able to spend in her lifetime, so choosing to have this child means her baby will be born a billionaire. She reportedly can't stop crying tears of joy as this is the one thing she has always wanted since she lost her baby at 14.\nThere is no truth to the above-quoted story. CelebTriCity is one of many fake news web sites currently operating on the Internet, and their disclaimer notes that CelebTriCity is \"the most notorious entertainment website in the world\" which publishes \"shocking headlines\" and a combination of \"real & satire news\" in order to keep its \"visitors in a state of disbelief.\"\nIn addition to the site's disclaimer, readers could have determined that the above-quoted article was fake by checking it against other sources. Oprah has not made any pregnancy announcement on her social media accounts, nor has this rumor been covered by any major news publication.\n[article-meta]",

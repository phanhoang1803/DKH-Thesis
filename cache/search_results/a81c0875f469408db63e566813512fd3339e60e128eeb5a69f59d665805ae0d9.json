      "content": "A YouTube star's video about his removal from a Delta Air Lines flight has gone viral across social media.\nAdam Saleh told the BBC he was asked to get off the London-New York flight on Wednesday after speaking to his mother in Arabic on the phone.\nHe said a fellow passenger had expressed feeling uncomfortable.\nBut in a statement, external, Delta Air Lines said that Mr Saleh and another customer had been removed because of disruptive and provocative behaviour.\nThe incident is said to have taken place while the plane was still at Heathrow airport, and also involved Mr Saleh's friend.\nMr Saleh said: \"This lady screamed, 'what is he saying?' and said she felt uncomfortable.\n\"The captain came and asked what happened.\n\"I was so disgusted I took a video, external as I was being asked to leave,\" he added.\nHowever, the US airline said that it had collected multiple statements from crew members and passengers and concluded that the \"customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behaviour, including shouting\".\n\"This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight,\" the statement said.\nIt continued: \"While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.\"\nMr Saleh said he later boarded a different flight with a different company.\n\"Once we were off the [Delta Air Lines] plane, we were told it was because we were being loud. You don't just kick someone off for being loud!\" said Mr Saleh.\nMr Saleh's friend, Slim Albaher, who was also escorted off the plane, said: \"I just froze. It was like something you'd only see in the movies.\"\nMr Saleh is well-known for carrying out pranks, which he posts on YouTube.\nEarlier this month, he claimed to have hidden in a suitcase, external and travelled from Melbourne to Sydney in the hold. It was later exposed as a hoax.\nMr Saleh has also filmed a number of experiments to see how plane passengers respond to flying alongside Muslims.\nNumerous Arabic speakers have reported being questioned, or made to leave planes, and felt it was because of their race or assumptions about their religion.\nLondon pastor Olaolu Opebiyi was removed from an easyJet plane in March, after a passenger spotted a \"prayer on his phone\" and reported him as a security threat.\nAn Iraqi university student in California said he was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight in the US after having a conversation in Arabic in April.\nFaizah Shaheen, a Muslim from Leeds, was detained by UK airport police under terror laws in August, after she was spotted reading a book on Syrian culture during her honeymoon flight.",

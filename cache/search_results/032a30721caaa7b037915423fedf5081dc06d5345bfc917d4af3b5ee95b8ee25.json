      "content": "On Vashon Island, there's an unusual local attraction.\nIt's an old, red, child's bicycle that's growing out of a tree.\nLocal residents say somebody must have put it on a branch on a fir tree in the 1950s, and the tree grew up around it.\nIt's been vandalized a number of times, but one man has been making sure the bike in the tree has its parts.\nJeff Ammon used to own Vashon's only bike shop.\nHe told KUOW's Lisa Brooks that he's been replacing the handlebars and wheels when they disappear.\nOver the years I have replaced the handlebars two or three  four times  I put a front wheel on it once. I just took over taking care of it, he said.\nHe added, Its a hard bike to find parts for because its a little kids bike. Its a low quality bike.\nHe believes the bike is being picked apart by locals.\nIts one of those things, theres no signage, unless you know right where it is, you would have a hard time finding it, he said.",

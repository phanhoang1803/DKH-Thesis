      "content": "The US has imposed sanctions on Nicaragua's Vice-President Rosario Murillo, the wife of President Daniel Ortega, accusing her of corruption and serious human rights abuses.\nShe is believed to have held influence over a youth organisation that the US says engaged in extra-judicial killings, torture and kidnapping.\nSanctions were also imposed on the presidential couple's security adviser.\nMs Murillo has ruled Nicaragua jointly with Mr Ortega for more than a decade.\nShe is accused of controlling the police and the youth wing of the governing Sandinista Liberation Front.\nOn Tuesday, the US Treasury said it was using a new executive order issued by US President Donald Trump to punish Ms Murillo, accusing her of undermining Nicaragua's democracy.\nMeanwhile her aide - and the president's security adviser - Nstor Moncada Lau was accused of carrying out orders by paying armed groups to attack protestors during months of anti-government disturbances earlier this year.\nThe sanctions will ban US individuals, banks and other entities from carrying out transactions with the pair, who will also have any assets that fall under US jurisdiction frozen.\nNicaragua has been through huge upheaval this year. In April, anti-government protesters demanded that the socialist president, Mr Ortega, step down over unpopular pension reforms.\nHowever, he refused to negotiate and instead sent in the security forces.\nHundreds were then killed in the space of weeks.",

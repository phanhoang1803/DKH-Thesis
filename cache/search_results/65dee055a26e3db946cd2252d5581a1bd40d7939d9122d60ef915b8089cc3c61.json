      "content": "Claim:\nKendrick Lamar bought and publicly destroyed the gun used by George Zimmerman to kill Trayvon Martin.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 12 May 2016, George Zimmerman  who was acquitted of shooting and killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012  put the gun he used to kill the teenager up for sale on a gun auction web site. A few days after the gun was listed, the entertainment web site Freddy Mag published a fake news article reporting that musician Kendrick Lamar had purchased the gun, then destroyed it live on stage:\n\"It was just the socially conscious thing to do. Plus all press is good press and I wasn't about to let him get anymore.\" Said rapper Kendrick Lamar about purchasing the gun used to murder Trayvon Martin that George Zimmerman put up for sale.\nThis story is a piece of fiction from a \"satire\" web site. Freddy Mag labels itself as \"number one in satirical urban culture news\" at the bottom of their site. Additionally, the web site's Facebook page states that its content is not real news:\nUrban culture and viral entertainment news. Because real news is depressing as f************ck.",

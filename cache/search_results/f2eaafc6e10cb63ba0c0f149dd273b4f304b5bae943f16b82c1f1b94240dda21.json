      "content": "The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Charlie Bolden, announced this morning that an experimental V-3 rocket launched by the Nazis during World War 2 could land in North America over the next few days.\nMeeting the press in Houston, Mr Bolden explained that NASA satellites first spotted the rocket a few months ago, and that the organization has been carefully monitoring its trajectory ever since.\nAccording to their observation, NASA experts have determined that the missile would soon reenter the Earths atmosphere, and would likely land in the American Midwest.\nWe have estimated that it would enter the atmosphere on December 26 or 27, Mr Bolden told reporters. Its hard to determine precisely where its going to hit, but it will almost certainly be in North America.",

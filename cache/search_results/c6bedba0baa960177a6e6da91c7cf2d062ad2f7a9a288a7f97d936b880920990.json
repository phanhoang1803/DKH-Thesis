      "content": "At a press conference in Eminems native Detroit this morning, Eminem made this announcement:\nHey everyone, Im excited to tell you about a new movie coming up. Working title is 8 Mile 2 and it will be about my life after I came up and will follow basically my whole career. Im really looking forward to seeing this movie with yall and I hope you like it as much as Ive liked filming it.\nSurprisingly, the flick is being directed by none other than Clint Eastwood, a man you dont normally think of when you think of rap. Eastwood had his own comments about the upcoming film:\nThis movie was a big challenge for me, not only because of the subject matter, but also because its hard to dramatize a mans entire career like we set out to do. Nevertheless I am very pleased with how things are going and I think were really coming up with a multi-dimensional, well rounded story about Eminems career, both the bright and the dark parts.",

Here's a genuine screenshot of Gaetz from this hearing (left) and the doctored image (right). It's clear that the height of his hair was embellished in the fake image.\nA video of the full \"Online Platforms and Market Power: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google\" hearing can be seen below. Gaetz speaks several times during this hearing. He can be glimpsed, for example, around the 3:03:00 mark:",

      "content": "Claim:\nAn image shows a mural painted in 1994 at Denver International Airport that shows citizens of the world wearing masks.\nIn June 2020, a photograph supposedly showing a mural that was painted at Denver International Airport in 1994 that depicted people from around the world wearing masks started to circulate on social media:\nLike many social media rumors about \"predictions,\" this image does not show a decades-old mural that foretold future events. Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one  or more!  of CJ Trinidads shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

      "title": "Painting of Children in Masks Isn't a 1994 Airport Mural",
      "date": "2020-06-30T20:46:57",
      "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994  and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork  depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries  was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\nThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994, the posts read. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airports public art available on the airports website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is not from DENs art collection. The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. Its called Children of the World Dream of Peace, but it doesnt include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting  posted by Trinidad days earlier  on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece Maskcommunication.\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, United Against Corona- Express through Art, by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the [d]ate of submission as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February  though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name NEHA appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting  and well update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994  and its false to say that its a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

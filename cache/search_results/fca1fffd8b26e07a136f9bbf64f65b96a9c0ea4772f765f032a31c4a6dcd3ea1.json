      "content": "Claim:\nPresident Obama is set to replace the bald eagle as the U.S.'s national animal.\nOn 2 May 2016, disreputable web site American News published an article with a sensational title (\"Obama To Replace National Bird The Bald Eagle With THIS\"). Despite the clickbait claim, the text of this article made no such argument:\nAccording to recent reports, our nation is about to get a new animaland its quite a departure from the bald eagle, which has been the sole symbol of the United States for 234 years.\nReports indicate that the National Bison Legacy Act has just been passed by Congress, and is expected to pass through the Senate next week. The act denotes the bison as Americas national mammal and a historical symbol of the United States.\nThe eagle will reportedly still represent the nation, but it will no longer be the sole animal doing so. If passed, the bison will join the bald eagle, the oak, and the rose as a symbol for our country.\nDespite the title, the actual story was primarily based on factual information. The National Bison Legacy Act, which designated the bison as the national mammal of the United States, was passed by Congress at the end of April 2016. But while this legislation will give the United States its first national mammal, it will have no effect on the bald eagle's status as the United States' national bird, nor as its national symbol.",

      "content": "Claim:\nA photograph taken by the International Space Station shows bushfires raging across Australia.\nIn January 2020, as record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought fueled a series of massive bushfires across Australia, a spectacular photograph was posted to social media purporting to show the scope of those across the continent as viewed from the International Space Station (ISS):\nHowever, this striking image did not originate with the ISS, nor was it actually a photograph. Rather, it was a \"3D visualization\" of the Australian fires by Anthony Hearsey, \"an image maker who specialises in photography, retouching and creative imaging,\" which was compiled from NASA satellite data collected across the span of a month.\nMany postings of this image included a disclaimer noting that the visualization encompassed \"all the areas which have been affected\" by fires in Australia, but that \"not all the areas are still burning\":\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/9oiePhO\nAnthony Hearsey himself offered a clarification of what this image represents:\nThis is a 3D visualisation of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as prettier looking graph.\nThis is made from data from NASAs FIRMS (Satellite data regarding fires) between 05/12/19 - 05/01/20. These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires.\nScale is a little exaggerated due to the renders glow, but generally true to the info from the NASA website. Also note that NOT all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation.",

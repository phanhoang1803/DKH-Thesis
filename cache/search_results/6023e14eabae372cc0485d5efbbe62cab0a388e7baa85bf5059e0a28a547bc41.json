      "content": "Claim:\nEmma Watson announced she was retiring from acting in February 2021.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\n\"Harry Potter\" star Emma Watson became the subject of internet rumors in February 2021 as fans noticed that her social media accounts were dormant since mid-2020.\nOn Feb. 20, 2021, Daily Mail reported Watson was stepping back from acting to spend time with her partner, resulting in thousands of her fans tweeting about her retirement.\nAlthough Daily Mail cited Watsons \"agent\" as the source of the news and quoted an unnamed publicist who reportedly said Watson's career is \"dormant\" and she \"is not taking on new commitments,\" other news outlets immediately reached out to the actors team to fact-check and learned that the rumor is false.\nJason Weinberg, Watson's manager at Untitled Entertainment, told Entertainment Weekly that \"Emma's social media accounts are dormant but her career isn't.\nGiven that the rumor was swiftly debunked by Watsons team, we rate this claim as False.",

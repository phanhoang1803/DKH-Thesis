      "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP)  Extremists stormed a luxury hotel in Kenyas capital on Tuesday, setting off thunderous explosions and gunning down people at cafe tables in an attack claimed by Africas deadliest Islamic militant group. A police officer said at least 15 people had died.\nIt is terrible. What I have seen is terrible, said Charles Njenga, who ran from a scene of blood, broken glass, burning vehicles and pillars of black smoke.\nAl-Shabab  the Somalia-based group that carried out the 2013 attack at the nearby Westgate Mall in Nairobi that left 67 people dead  claimed responsibility for the carnage at the DusitD2 hotel complex, which includes bars, restaurants, offices and banks and is in a well-to-do neighborhood with many American, European and Indian expatriates.\nA Kenyan police officer said 15 bodies had been taken to the morgue. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. The U.S. State Department confirmed that an American citizen was among those killed, but did not release the victims identity. Al-Shabab asserted that 47 people were killed but its Shahada news agency post gave no details.\nAuthorities sent special forces into the hotel to flush out the gunmen. Early Wednesday, Kenyas Interior Ministry said in a tweet that all buildings had been secured and there was no further threat to the public. Hours later, at dawn, another explosion and gunfire were heard. The Interior Ministry said authorities were mopping up the scene but did not given details on the fate of the attackers.\nTo God be the Glory. We have been rescued. Over 50 people in my group. No injuries Thank you all for the support and prayers. Thanks You KDF, tweeted a Kenyan businesswoman, Aggie Asiimwe Konde. KDF stands for the Kenya Defense Forces.\nLucy Wanjiru said she had been trying to flee when she saw a woman on the ground floor get shot. Wanjiru ended up in a washroom with several other scared people. Her friend Cynthia Kibe stayed in contact with her by phone overnight.\nI think I panicked when she told me that the gunshots are next to her, Kibe said. I had to keep telling her Just wait, help is on the way, they are almost there, they are almost there. And then at one point she was like, Please tell me I am getting out of here alive and then it was just like my breaking point.\nAuthorities did not say how many attackers there were  or what happened to them  though Kenyas Citizen TV aired security-camera footage that showed at least four heavily armed men in dark-colored, paramilitary-style gear.\nA police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media said bodies were seen in restaurants downstairs and in offices upstairs, but there was no time to count the dead.\nA witness who gave his name only as Ken said he saw five bodies at the hotel entrance. Other people were shouting for help and when we rushed back to try to rescue them, gunshots started coming from upstairs, and we had to duck because they were targeting us and we could see two guys shooting, he said.\nThe coordinated assault began with an explosion that targeted three vehicles outside a bank, and a suicide bombing in the hotel lobby that severely wounded a number of guests, said Kenyas national police chief, Joseph Boinnet.\nSurvivors reported hearing a shattering blast and saw people mowed down by gunmen as they sat in a cafe. Victims were left slumped on tables.\nWe were changing our shifts, and that is when I heard a loud blast and people were screaming, said Enoch Kibet, who works as a cleaner at the cafe and managed to crawl out a basement gate. I couldnt believe I was alive. The blast was so loud and shook the whole complex.\nKenyan hospitals appealed for blood donations even as the number of wounded remained unclear.\nAssociated Press video from inside the hotel showed Kenyan security officers searching the building and scared workers emerging from hiding while gunfire could still be heard. Some climbed out a window by ladder. One man got up from the floor where he appeared to be trying to hide under a piece of wood paneling, then showed his ID.\nAs officers searched luxury fashion displays, wounded people were carried away on stretchers.\nLike the attack at the Westgate Mall, this one appeared aimed at wealthy Kenyans and foreigners. It came a day after a magistrate ruled that three men must stand trial in connection with the Westgate Mall siege.\nAl-Shabab has vowed retribution against Kenya for sending troops to Somalia to fight it since 2011. Tuesdays violence came three years to the day after al-Shabab extremists attacked a Kenyan military base in Somalia, killing scores of people.\nThe al-Qaida-linked group has killed hundreds of people in Kenya. In the deadliest attack, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for an assault on Kenyas Garissa University in 2015 that killed 147 people, mostly students.\nThe latest carnage demonstrated al-Shababs continued ability to carry out spectacular acts of bloodshed despite a dramatic increase in U.S. airstrikes against it under President Donald Trump.\nTourism  an important source of revenue in Kenya, East Africas largest economy  has suffered because of the violence.\nGunfire could be heard for hours after Tuesdays attack began. Some people ducked behind cars, screaming, while others took cover behind fountains and other features at the lush complex. A bomb disposal unit was called in, and police blew up a car they said had explosives inside. A grenade was seen in a hallway.\nDozens of people were rushed to safety as plainclothes officers went from shop to shop in the complex. Some people held up their hands to show they were unarmed.\nA Kenyan intelligence official said the country had been on high alert since November, with information about potential attacks on high-profile targets in Nairobi. The official was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nDespite the repeated attacks, the Kenya-Somalia border remains porous, with al-Shabab extremists able to easily bribe their way across, according to a U.N. panel of experts.\nThe hotel complex, owned by Thailands Dusit International chain in Nairobis Westlands neighborhood, is about a mile (2 kilometers) from Westgate Mall on a relatively quiet, tree-lined road in what is considered one of the most secure parts of the city. The hotels website says it is cocooned away from the hustle and bustle in a secure and peaceful haven.\nOn Monday, the hotel promoted its spa by tweeting: Is your new year off to a rough start?\n___\nAssociated Press writers Abdi Guled in Nairobi, Kenya, and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed.\n___",

      "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump's son Eric said that Hispanic people should be sent back to Asia.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 20 May 2016, the entertainment web site Politicops published a fake news article reporting that Eric Trump said that his father (Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump) planned to send \"Hispanics\" \"back to Asia\" when he became president:\nTrump Junior continued, Like, for instance, I was very good at geography when I was in school. But, they dont know that. And thats just another example of how lazy the Hispanics are as a race. And the main reason why theyre so afraid of my dad is hes going to deport them back to Asia when he wins the election. Its a well-known fact that fear makes people to crazy things. Its made them come and try to suck up to me so Id help them get in my dads good graces. Yeah, good luck with that.\nMy father is not a stupid man, and I can tell you he didnt father a stupid son, either, Eric Trump added. And when he does deport all these lazy Hispanics back to Asia where they came from, hell be doing that for two reasons. The first one is obvious  we dont need lazy people in this country. The second is thats part of his plan of taking back American jobs from China. Thats why hell send most of the Hispanics back to the Chinese capital of Bangkok, which is where most American jobs are located at the moment.\nHowever, Eric Trump never said that his father would send Hispanics \"back to Asia.\" Politicops, like its sister site Newslo, is a \"hybrid\" web site that publishes a mixture of news and fiction:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nIn this case, Politicops started with a real comment that Eric Trump made on a radio show explaining how Hispanics \"couldn't wait\" for his father to become president:\nPeople often talk about Hispanics, Eric Trump said earlier this week on Irish radios RTE Radio1s \"Drivetime.\"\nYou know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me, Listen, I cant wait for your father to be president. Hes going to bring jobs back to the United States. Hes going to end the nonsense. Hes going to create good trade deals. Hes going to create better education. Hes going to create a better family structure.\nReaders of Politicops can find out which portion of the article is fake and which portion is real by clicking on the \"Show Facts / Hide Facts\" button included at the top of articles:",

      "content": "Claim:\nHillary Clinton refused to exit her vehicle at an event in Florida after the crowd started chanting \"lock her up.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 1 November 2016, the web site Red State Watcher reported that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had canceled a campaign event in Florida after Donald Trump supporters bombarded with \"lock her up\" chants.\nRed State Watcher published two pieces of \"evidence\" to back up their claim: a photograph from the New York Times showing Hillary Clinton walking through a crowd as some people held \"Trump/Pence\" signs, and a Facebook post from an anonymous person claiming that Clinton was too afraid to get out of her car.\nThe web site failed to note that these two pieces of evidence contradicted one another  if Clinton was too afraid to get out of her car, how was she also photographed talking to the crowd, clearly not in a vehicle?\nThe New York Times featured a photo of Hillary Clinton being welcomed to an early voting site in Pompano Beach, Florida on Sunday. Apparently, she didn't stay too long at her rally location at the Pompano Beach Amphitheater. Clinton almost melted at the sight of Trump signs surrounding her and people yelling \"Lock Her Up!\". A police escort shared what happened:\nThe photograph from the New York Times is real, and does show Clinton with a crowd of people (some of whom were holding Trump/Pence signs) in Pompano Beach, Florida. It is also evidence that the message posted by \"Salty Dad,\" claiming that Clinton \"refused to exit her vehicle,\" is inaccurate.\nOn 30 October 2016, Clinton spent much of the day touring Broward County. According to the caption on the New York Times photograph, her Pompano Beach visit was an impromptu stop to greet a group of early voters:\nThe Sun-Sentinel noted that the visit occurred outside the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center, not the Pompano Beach Amphitheater (where she was not scheduled to host a rally to begin with) and that while a few people chanted \"lock her up,\" it didn't stop Clinton from taking a few selfies with supporters:\nShe also traveled to Pompano Beach to visit people outside the early voting site at the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center. Jennie Jones, of Pompano Beach, took a selfie with Clinton, which she said she couldn't wait to show her grandchildren.\n\"She's the next president of the United States,\" said Betty Nesbitt of Fort Lauderdale, who yelled \"I love you Hillary\" to her candidate.\nAbout a half dozen Trump supporters who were at the early voting site holding signs for their candidate got a chance to express a different view. \"Lock her up,\" yelled Gary Moss, of Pompano Beach.",

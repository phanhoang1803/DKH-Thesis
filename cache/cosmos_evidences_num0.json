        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

        "date": "2020-06-01T03:29:03",
        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

When brainstorming people to feature, Thunberg was the first person that came to mind.\nIf we can amplify her message and get more people involved and listening to what shes saying, then were doing some good, he said.\nThe overall feedback has been incredibly positive, he said. But the most critical reactions have been from those who havent recognized her.\nTheyre struck by the image and want to learn more, he said. If they take the time to learn more about what shes trying to share, that I think has an impact on most people. Makes them want to help.\nAndrs Petreselli is the artist behind the mural. He also did the citys Robin Williams one, which is how Scott found his work.\nPetreselli is donating his time to the cause and told CNN he feels connected to everything Thunberg is doing. She sets examples for the whole world, he said.\nWere pretty much at the beginning of our extinction, so if we dont do anything right now, its going to be too late, he said.\nIts not the first mural to the young activist\nThunberg and her message have inspired murals around the world. One in Bristol, England, featuring the activist partly underwater went up earlier this year, along with another one in Canada.\nNot everyone has been eager to hear her message. The mural in Canada, painted on a free wall along a bike path, was defaced twice shortly after it was first created, according to CNN affiliate CBC.\nThe adversity hasnt stopped Thunberg, though.\nShe is best known for her climate strikes, which she began in 2018 outside the Swedish Parliament. Her protest inspired thousands of students around the world to walk out of class and demand action on the climate crisis.\nShe hasnt slowed down. Shes spoken to everyone from the United Nations to the US Congress  and even former President Barack Obama  about the climate crisis.",

Cobre also painted a revered mural of the comedian Robin Williams that has since been demolished.\nClimate change is real, Cobre told SFGate. This girl Greta is awesome and she knows what shes doing. I hope with this mural people will realize we have to take care of the world.\nThe environmental not-for-profit group One Atmosphere reportedly reached out to Cobre after the mural of Williams was slated to come down and just as Cobre was searching for a building for his next project. The organization is said to be supplying all the paint for the project.\nIts not the first time Thunberg has been immortalized in street art. Earlier this year, the UK-based aerosol artist Jody Thomas painted a 50ft portrait of the teenager on the face of the historic Tobacco Factory in Bristol.\nShes very much in the limelight, very current, very contemporary and shes obviously clearly leading a very, very important issue which affects all of us on the planet, Thomas told the Huffington Post.\nAt 16, Thunberg has already reached the exalted status of Nobel peace prize nominee, leader of a movement to reclaim the planet for future generations, focus of Donald Trumps mockery, and hero among progressives and young people.\nIn September, Thunberg became the face of a vast, coordinated strike to protest against government inaction on the climate crisis. Demonstrations spanned an estimated 185 countries in one of the largest environmental protests in history.\nYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet Im one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

        "content": "Claim:\nNASA warned that Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) could hit Earth in April 2020 and cause catastrophic danger.\nOn April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earths surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earths surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earths surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earths surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earths atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earths surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

        "content": "Nigerias president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has sent troops to rescue more than 250 children kidnapped by gunmen from a school in the north-west of the country in one of the largest mass abductions in recent years.\nThe mass kidnapping in Kaduna state was the second in a week in Nigeria, where heavily armed criminal gangs on motorbikes target victims in villages and schools and along highways in search of ransom payments.\nLocal government officials in Kaduna confirmed the kidnapping at Kuriga school on Thursday, but said they could not give firm figures because they were still working out how many children had been abducted.\nAt least one person was shot dead during the attack, local residents said.\nSani Abdullahi, a teacher at the GSS Kuriga school in Chikun district, said staff managed to escape with many students when the gunmen, known locally as bandits, attacked early on Thursday firing in the air.\nHe told local officials 187 pupils had been taken from the main junior school and another 100 from the primary classes. Three local residents also said that between 200 and 280 children and teachers had been abducted.\nEarly in the morning ... we heard gunshots from bandits. Before we knew it they had gathered up the children, Musa Mohammed, a local resident said. We are pleading to the government, all of us are pleading, they should please help us with security.\nThe Kaduna abduction and the mass kidnapping a week ago from camps for displaced people displaced in north-east Borno state illustrate the challenge facing Tinubu, who promised to make Nigeria safer and bring in more foreign investment.\nI have received briefing from security chiefs on the two incidents, and I am confident that the victims will be rescued, Tinubu said in a statement ordering that armed forces to track down the kidnappers. Nothing else is acceptable to me and the waiting family members of these abducted citizens. Justice will be decisively administered.\nThe two mass kidnappings come almost 10 years after the Boko Haram group triggered a major international outcry in April 2014 by kidnapping more than 250 schoolgirls from Chibok in Borno state. Some of those girls are still missing.\nMore than 100 people are reported missing after militants carried out the mass kidnapping last week targeting women and children in camps for those displaced by conflict in Borno, but conflicting accounts have emerged about the time and number of victims.\nPolice did not provide figures for the Kuriga school kidnapping. The numbers reported in such incidents are often lowered after people who went missing while fleeing them return home.\nThe Kaduna state government and security agencies are working round the clock to ensure the safe return of the schoolchildren, the state governor, Uba Sani, said on X. I have received strong assurances from the president and national security adviser that no stone will be left unturned to bring back the children.\nHundreds of schoolchildren and college students have been kidnapped in mass abductions in the north-west and central regions in the last three years, including in Kaduna.\nAlmost all were released for ransom payments after weeks or months spent in captivity at camps hidden in the forests that stretch across north-western Nigeria.\nUnicef condemned Thursdays attack and called on the government to do more to protect students.\nSchools are supposed to be sanctuaries of learning and growth, not sites of fear and violence, the agencys Nigeria director, Christian Munduate, said in a statement.\nNigerias armed forces are battling on several fronts, including against armed criminals in the north-west and a long-running jihadist insurgency in the north-east that has killed 40,000 people and displaced more than two million since 2009.\nFighting in Borno has eased as militants have been pushed back from the territory they once controlled, but they still carry out attacks, kidnappings and raids in remote areas.\nGunmen abducted more than 30 people, including 24 female students, in a raid on a university in north-west Zamfara state in September.\nIn February 2021, gunmen raided a girls boarding school in the town of Jangebe in Zamfara, kidnapping about 300 students. Months earlier, more than 300 students were taken from a boys school in Kankara in Katsina state. They were released days later.\nBetween July 2022 and June 2023, 3,620 people were abducted in 582 kidnapping incidents in Nigeria, according to the local risk analysts SBM Intelligence. It has recorded 4,777 people abducted since Tinubu took office in May last year.",

Normal lobsters are a mottled greenish-brown.\nBut in recent years, accounts of bright blue, orange, yellow, calico, white and even split lobsters  one color on one side, another on the other  have jumped. It's now common to hear several stories a month of a lobsterman bringing one of the quirky crustaceans to shore.\nIt's anybody's guess why more oddities are popping up in lobster traps, said Michael Tlusty, research director at the New England Aquarium in Boston.\nIt could be simply because advances in technology  cellphone cameras and social media  make it easier to spread the word about bizarre lobster sightings.\nIt's also likely more weird lobsters are being caught because the overall harvest has soared. In Maine, the catch has grown fourfold in the past 20 years, to nearly 105 million pounds last year. If the yield has quadrupled, it would make sense to have four times as many unconventional lobsters being caught as well.\nAlthough lobster is the No. 1 commercial fishery in the Northeast, there are a lot of unanswered questions about the bottom-dwelling creatures, he said.\n\"Are we seeing more because the Twitter sphere is active and people get excited about colorful lobsters?\" Tlusty said. \"Is it because we're actually seeing an upswing in them? Is it just that we're catching more lobsters so we have the opportunity to see more?\n\"Right now you can make a lot of explanations, but the actual data to find them out just isn't there.\"\nLobsters come in a variety of colors because of genetic variations.\nIt's been written that the odds of catching a blue lobster are 1-in-2 million, while orange comes in at 1-in-10 million. Yellow and orange-and-black calico lobsters have been pegged at 1-in-30 million, split-colored varieties at 1-in-50 million, and white  the rarest of all  at 1-in-100 million.\nBut those are merely guesses, and nobody knows for sure.\nWhat is known is that colored lobsters have shown up in greater frequency in certain areas over the years.\nThe waters off Cutler in eastern Maine were once a hotbed for blue ones, after 1,500 larvae-sized blue lobsters were released in 1990 to use as a tracking tool to determine their survival rates, said Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine's Lobster Institute.\nThe waters off Montauk, N.Y., once had a lot of blue lobsters as well, he said, after researchers released large numbers of blue lobsters there. The bright-orange lobsters that were in Sarro's shipment are believed to have come from the same waters in Canada.\nAside from their color, the lobsters are apparently normal in all other ways, Bayer said. They all turn red when they're cooked, except for the white ones since they don't have any pigment, and diners wouldn't notice a difference.\n\"There's no difference in taste,\" he said.\nScientists say it's possible the lobster population as a whole has a greater percentage of misfits than it did in years past.\nThe off-colored lobsters are more susceptible to predators because they stick out more on the ocean bottom, rather than blending in like normal ones, said Diane Cowan, executive director of The Lobster Conservancy in Friendship, Maine.\n\"But with the predator population down, notably cod, there might be greater survival rates among these color morphs that are visually easier to pick out,\" she said.\nLobstermen have brought Cowan countless colorful lobsters over the years. The prettiest one, she said, was pink and purple.",

        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

Popular memes have claimed (for humorous effect) that the picture was taken in Massachusetts, or (less homorously) in Canada:\nThe image actually captures a stretch of road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture.\nThe photograph was taken by Mihai Apostu and posted to his blog, \"A Romanian in Japan,\" in April 2007:\nBefore heading down town we decided to take a walk up to Towada. On the way to Towada starting from April thh Gold Line Route is opened. This year's amount of snow was smaller than last year but the Hakkoda Walls are still big. Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall. This year there were only 6 metres of snow that guided us to Tsuta Onsen.\nAccording to a sightseeing guide for the Aomori region of Japan, the Hakkoda Walls are quite a tourist attraction. Heavy snowfalls frequently close the corridor during the winter, but when the spring season approaches the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad gets to work and clears the road:\nNational Highway 103, commonly known as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line, is a popular sightseeing route in Aomori.8 km of this Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line stretching from Sukayu to Yachi Hot Springs is closed off in winter, but thanks to the efforts of the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad, they plow through the snow from both ends to meet at Kasamatsu Pass in late March, creating a stunning snow corridor.\nIn some places the walls of snow reach a height of 9 m, allowing visitors to enjoy magnificent views of the vivid blue of the sky contrasted against the white of the snow in perfect harmony.\nThe road opens to general traffic on April 1, but before this, a Hakkoda walk is held every year to walk through this snow corridor, and many people take part in the event.",

With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, its a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phones date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablets operating system that youll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so theres not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, its possible  at least in theory  that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says its looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist!

The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

Neon Nettle deliberately and misleadingly conflated these two stories to make is seem as if we were disclaiming a successful child trafficking raid in Georgia rather than debunking a false report of child trafficking in Arizona.\nThe FBI sting in Atlanta, code-named Operation Safe Summer, was specific to the state of Georgia and had nothing to do with the false report of a \"child trafficking bunker\" allegedly discovered by a group in Arizona:\nNORTH FULTON COUNTY, GA.  A sting on the sex-trafficking trade in metro Atlanta netted dozens of arrests and the rescue of dozens of children forced into sexual servitude, the FBI announced this week.\nOperation Safe Summer was a collaborative effort between the FBI's Atlanta field office and 38 law enforcement agencies in six metro counties, assistant Special Agent in Charge Matt Alcoke told Channel 2's Mike Petchenik.\nThe Neon Nettle story was apparently sourced from fellow conspiracy theorists The Free Thought Project, who engaged in similar deceptive headlining:\nAs Snopes 'Debunks' Child Trafficking Camp, 160 Kids as Young as 3 Rescued in Georgia\nAfter Snopes called allegations of child trafficking made by a veterans group a 'conspiracy theory', 160 children, as young as 3-years-old, were rescued from traffickers in Georgia.\nFree Thought Project insinuated, in an impressive combination of logical fallacies, that because we (and others) debunked the false \"pedophilia bunker\" in Arizona story, we must not believe child trafficking exists anywhere in the world at all:\nSnopes  whether deliberately or not  is actively engaging in censorship of content that could actually help children by engaging others and fostering discussion. Instead of allowing the discussion to continue, Snopes deliberately shut down the conversation, insuring that the very important topic of child trafficking is forced into the memory hole and never heard of again.\nAs the above case illustrates, child trafficking is a horrifying reality. While Pizzagate scenarios may not be real, there are far worse incidents taking place across the country.\nChild trafficking is, indeed, a horrifying reality, which is why we choose to cover it responsibly rather than making the job of law enforcement and advocacy groups immeasurably more difficult by irresponsibly propagating false information about child trafficking (as sites such as Neon Nettle and the Free Thought Project do).\nFor example, the \"veterans' group\" that stumbled across the abandoned homeless camp on private property in Tucson decided that the presence of child's toys at one end of the camp and pornographic magazines elsewhere was obvious evidence of child sex trafficking, rather than ordinary detritus left behind at a temporary site where those migrating from one region to another chose to stop for a while and perhaps have a moment or two alone to tend to some rather common needs.\nThat group also decided (again, without any evidence) that straps tied around trees were \"restraints\" for holding children in bondage, rather than for some other more prosaic use, such as tying up tarps to provide shade from the relentless Arizona sun. When local and federal authorities investigated the site and found nothing but an abandoned homeless encampment, the same \"veteran's group\" immediately accused law enforcement of orchestrating a massive cover-up.",

The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as marijuana kills cancer.\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the overview section:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells  including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet admission of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added quietly in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ prove that cannabis kills cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not prove anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be cured by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has no currently accepted medical use, which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Governments official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal governments center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI admitted that cannabis kills cancer uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way prove that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

This picture actually shows a tooth that was artistically mounted by a fossil seller.\nThe photograph was originally posted on Reddit in July 2012 under the title \"The newest addition to my museum of a house: a megalodon tooth stuck in a whale vertebrae!\" Users were skeptical of the image, however, and noted that similar items could be purchased on eBay for relatively low prices.\nThe original poster asked their father, who had purchased the item, about it an returned to the thread with this reply:\nMy dad just came home and I asked him, and his response was, \"It's a real tooth and a real vertebra from a whale, but are you kidding me?! Of course the guy put them together! If it originally came like that, it would be worth millions of dollars and be in a museum!\" So yea, they are both real, but the tooth was not originally lodged in there -.-\nAnother picture showing a megalodon tooth embedded in a whale bone can be found on the web site Fossilera, where it is accompanied by a similar explanation: The tooth and the bone are both authentic, but the tooth was artistically mounted in the bone before it was sold. Fossilera similarly noted that it is highly unlikely anyone would discover a genuine fossil of megalodon tooth and a whale bone connected in this fashion:\nThis is a fossil Megalodon tooth which has been artistically mounted in a fossil whale cervical (neck) vertebrae, representing predator and prey. Whales were one of the main prey items on the Megalodon, their fossilized bones often bear tooth marks, and Megalodon teeth often show significant feeding damage from striking bone due to feeding.\nRealistically the massive bite forces would have caused the tooth and/or the vertebrae to fracture, so you wouldn't naturally have a intact tooth embedded in a bone like this. But, it makes for a cool, and conversation starting display.\nFossils Online also has an example of a megalodon tooth embedded in a whale bone. Again, this item is accompanied by a description which noted that the \"tooth has been placed in the vertebra\":\nInteresting display piece. Paperweight for someone's office? Book end? The tooth has been placed in the vertebra. This was not found like this. On very rare occasions, the tip of a shark tooth is found imbedded in whale bone. Bite marks are usually left behind, but rarely a tip of a tooth is found. This shows the interaction between the two species in a more artistic fashion. The vertebra measures approximately 5 1/2\" tall.",

Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one  or more!  of CJ Trinidads shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

        "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994  and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork  depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries  was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\nThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994, the posts read. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airports public art available on the airports website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is not from DENs art collection. The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. Its called Children of the World Dream of Peace, but it doesnt include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting  posted by Trinidad days earlier  on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece Maskcommunication.\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, United Against Corona- Express through Art, by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the [d]ate of submission as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February  though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name NEHA appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting  and well update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994  and its false to say that its a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nA Facebook post went even further into the false conspiracy theory, posting an image of the painting with the caption, Illuminati art works on display.\nHowever, these posts are not correct.\nThe communications office at the Denver airport told The Associated Press in an email that the painting in question is not an image from the airports art collection.\nThe only mural painted in 1994 for DEN featuring international children wearing traditional clothing and that also features flags is Leo Tangumas Children of the World Dream of Peace, but there are no kids wearing masks, said Alex Rentera, a public information officer for the airport.\nWhats more, the image was not circulating on the internet before this year. In a reverse-image search, the AP found that the oldest posts available are from February 2020.\nA Filipino artist named Christian Joy Trinidad painted the work, which he called Maskcommunication.\nThe artists Instagram account features a photograph of the painting, which confirms that the version on Facebook has been edited. The version spreading online features a boy wearing a mask with an Israeli flag. But in the original, that boy is actually wearing a mask with a Palestinian flag.\nThe AP contacted Trinidad and he confirmed through an Instagram message that he created the painting for a contest in late February.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson contributed to this report from Seattle.\n__\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

        "content": "Claim:\nIn late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed whereby motorists were tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the road, as part of a prevalent sex-trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Yall See Anything Like This, Dont Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Dont Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"",

In fact, users who clicked the above-displayed message were greeted with a popup message requesting permission from a Facebook app to post on their behalf, making the article appear less like a hoax and more like an outright scam:\nMessages about Jaden Smith's alleged suicide were shared from various sites, and led to a variety of dodgy-sounding Facebook apps, including \"Smart Mobiles,\" \"Gadgy Land,\" \"Pakiza,\" \"Top Feeds\" and several others.\nIntrepid internet users who clicked the link and gave the app permission were eventually greeted with one of several \"news\" story claiming that Jaden Smith had committed suicide. The web sites responsible for this hoax have published dozens of fake news stories and graphics with this false claim:\nUsers who granted these apps permission to post to Facebook on their behalf quickly found this death hoax posted to their own Facebook feeds, thereby replicating itself across social media.\nJaden Smith himself has been active on his social media accounts, seemingly unaware that he's supposed to be dead.

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows members of the NYPD wearing \"I Can Breathe\" shirts mocking the death of George Floyd.\nA photograph of a group of men wearing shirts saying \"I Can Breathe\" spread online between late May and early June 2020 after the death of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd while in custody of Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer. The shirts appear to be in a Comic Sans font, and those wearing them are holding up a sign supporting the New York Police Department, prompting Snopes readers to ask us if they were members of the NYPD.\nThe shirts would appear to be both a dark and flippant play on words stemming from one of the last statements uttered by Floyd before he died on May 25, which was \"I can't breathe.\"\nBut the image actually shows protesters from a demonstration in December 2014, months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of an NYPD officer, and more than five years before the death of George Floyd.\nIn July 2014, Garner died as a result of police officer Daniel Pantaleo placing him in a chokehold. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for protesters calling for an end to police killings of black people. In early December 2014, a grand jury found \"no reasonable cause\" to bring charges against Pantaleo, triggering protests. In July 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered that the case against Pantaleo be dropped, and a month later, Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD.\nAccording to one report from the 2014 demonstration, about 100 people gathered outside New York's City Hall in support of the NYPD on Dec. 19, while other reports said the number was closer to 50. The pro-NYPD gathering, organized by a group called Thank You NYPD, faced off against around 200 counter-protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Organizers from Thank You NYPD told The Village Voice that their group was not made up of police officers, but \"citizens who appreciate the safety that the NYPD provides our great city. Ten million people policed by 35,000 officers is one hell of a task to handle.\"\nAt the demonstration, the pro-NYPD protesters chanted \"Don't resist arrest\" when the anti-police brutality demonstrators chanted \"I can't breathe.\"\nA video from the protest, by ReasonTV, sets the scene:\nA 2014 report from Gawker included some of the shirt-wearer's perspectives. An attendee named Mike Stables had flown in from Colorado for the protest, bringing \"I Can Breathe\" T-shirts with him.\nWhile it is not clear whether many NYPD cops were part of the protests or wearing the shirts, a number of people close to the police were present. Some attendees included a retired NYPD detective and a mother of an NYPD officer. According to CBS, neither Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, nor police unions, endorsed the rally because of concerns about violence. Bratton expected a low turnout. Patrick Lynch, a police union leader, complained about the lack of support from New York City's mayor and his administration:\nPetulant police union leader Pat Lynch recently complained of the lack of support coming from City Hall: \"If they're not going to support us when we need 'em, we'll embarrass them when we can.\"\nIn the above video, a pro-NYPD protester at City Hall responded to a journalist's comment on how the police use force to defend themselves: \"They do it with force -- well, no, we're not allowed to use force.\"\nSteven W. Thrasher, a columnist and faculty member at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, reflected on his coverage of the December 2014 protest for Contexts. By his account, off-duty cops were indeed present:\nHere I was, being 'protected' by the NYPD on duty, surrounded by angry, white, retired and off-duty cops and their supporters. Who hated the press and, it seemed, Black people  and I was in the middle of them.\nAnother report from Gothamist relates an exchange between protesters, indicating more off-duty cops were present:\n\"Where's your badge?\" one woman asked a man on the police side.\n\"It's in my pocket!\" the man replied.\n\"Why don't you take it out?\"\n\"I don't have to, I'm not on duty, bitch!\"\n... \"My boss told me to behave myself tonight,\" said Scott, a police officer who works in Connecticut.\nIt is clear from multiple reports that off-duty cops were indeed present at the pro-police side of the rally, but we are still unable to determine if any of them were wearing the shirts saying \"I Can Breathe.\" We do know that these images are from a 2014 rally supporting the NYPD after the death of Garner, and not in response to the death of Floyd. We thus rate this image as \"Miscaptioned.\"",

She also performed at a benefit show for the Japanese Red Cross.\n\"Let's all continue to support each other, be kind to each other and love each other,\" she added, drawing comparisons with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\nEarthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Last month, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck off the coast of the Fukushima prefecture, raising fears of a repeat crisis but causing little damage.\nSome 40,000 people are still displaced by the disaster, unable to return home to areas near the wrecked plant that are still off-limits due to radioactive contamination.\nThe government has spent about $300 billion to rebuild the region, but safely decommissioning the plant will take decades and billions of dollars.\nIn a show of rebirth, Fukushima had been due to host parts of the Summer Olympics that were scheduled to take place in Japan in 2020.\nHowever, the games were delayed to July due to the pandemic and have been hit by a sexism scandal. The resignation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe due to ill health last August and worsening U.S.-China tensions have further clouded what was supposed to be a year of celebration for the country.\nThursday's memorial comes two weeks before the Olympic torch run will begin from Fukushima. Suga said the Olympics will showcase Japan's recovery from the disaster.\nArata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Adela Suliman reported from London.",

But how much do we know about them?\nThe discovery of an unexploded World War Two bomb in Exeter resulted in a military response, thousands of residents being evacuated from their homes and extensive damage to nearby properties.\nAfter being discovered on an allotment due for development, the 2,200lb (1,000kg) German bomb was blown up on Saturday in a controlled explosion, leaving a crater the size of three double-decker buses.\nResidents have all been allowed back into their homes but many of the properties are \"uninhabitable\" according to Exeter City Council. About 300 students are still waiting to be allowed back into their accommodation.\nThe BBC has spoken to a series of experts about the wider questions surrounding unexploded ordnance.\nHow did the bomb get there?\nExeter was the first victim of the Baedecker Raids on English cultural centres during World War Two, made in response to the British bombing of Lbeck.\nThe raids were named after the Baedeker guidebook used by the German military to select historic targets in England.\nThe Blitz of Exeter in April and May 1942 \"was the single most destructive event in the city's history since at least the attack by the Vikings in 1003\" said Dr Todd Gray.\nThe historian from the University of Exeter said the recently discovered bomb most likely fell during one of these attacks, when the city was targeted for morale rather than for strategic purposes.\nNearly 300 people died, more than 1,700 buildings were destroyed, 7,000 high explosives and incendiary bombs were dropped and 40 high explosive bombs did not detonate.\nThe sound of the bomb being exploded on Saturday was \"ferocious\", but Dr Gray said he felt \"quite thankful\" to have heard the noise as a reminder of what it would have been like at the time.\n\"That bomb going off reminds us what that generation in 1940s went through,\" said Dr Gray.\n\"It's sobering, but now and then something like this is good for us to think about.\"\nThe bomb was discovered near Exeter St David's railway station in an area not covered by a \"bomb census\".\n\"There's bound to be I would have thought one or two more somewhere,\" he added.\nCould there be more nearby?\nEmily Charles, a World War Two curator at the Imperial War Museum said the exact number of bombs across the country was not known and it was \"really hard\" to work out where unexploded bombs could be.\nThe allies kept a detailed record of bomb damage inflicted on British cities during the war called the bomb census, said Ms Charles.\nThey created maps to show the most damaged areas, which can give historians a \"better picture\" of where unexploded ordnance could be, she added.\nThe most common type of bomb used in the Blitz was about 500lb (226.8kg), meaning the 2,200lb (1,000kg) bomb detonated in Exeter was \"particularly large\" said Ms Charles.\nHowever, she stressed it was \"not uncommonly large\" and bombs of this size had been found in recent years.\nCould they explode?\nA guide on managing the risk of unexploded devices was released by the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) in 2019.\nThe CIRIA guide said ordnance could be reactivated by either direct impact, vibration or heating.\nThe lack of fatalities in instances when construction teams discover unexploded devices \"is particularly because of the Germans commonly using electrical fuses in WW2 that stopped functioning when the battery expired\", said the guide.\n\"What makes unexploded bombs dangerous is their unpredictability,\" said Ms Charles.\nShe told the BBC there were \"not huge scientific studies\" on how explosives degraded or whether they got more deadly over time.\n\"So I think the best course of action is to treat them as if they are deadly.\"\nThat the bomb was detonated in a controlled explosion and houses suffered damage, proves they can still be dangerous, she said.\nThere are multiple reasons that bombs do not detonate upon landing, explained Ms Charles, such as faulty fuses, defects or the way they land.\nShe said people should call the police if they spot any suspected explosive devices.\nHow much is there across the country?\nThe Ministry of Defence says since 2010 it has been involved with making safe 450 German WW2 bombs - about 60 a year, the BBC Reality Check team revealed in 2018.\nHowever, these figures do not factor in the involvement of private companies that can also dispose of unexploded devices.\nThis can make it difficult to establish exact figures for how many are dealt with each year across the country.\nA specialist from one such private company, Zetica UXO, told the BBC that since World War Two \"45,000 unexploded bombs have been found and more are being found all the time\".\nOfficial records, which can often be understated, predicted around \"200,000 plus bombs were detonated\" during the war said Mike Sainsbury.\nHe said it was estimated that \"another 10% or so\" did not explode.\nHow to detonate an unexploded bomb?\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson said explosive ordnance teams from the Royal Navy and Army worked with local authorities to safely dispose of the bomb.\nMilitary teams worked for 24 hours to build protective structures and trenches to minimise the impacts of the blast and used more than \"400 tonnes of sand\" to mitigate the explosion.",

Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph.

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin hasnt been vaccinated against the coronavirus yet, months after he announced his countrys Sputnik V as the worlds first approved Covid-19 vaccine and said his own daughter had taken it.\nThe Kremlin said Tuesday that Putin cannot get a vaccine that has not yet finished the final stage of trials, even though the jab has already been given to some Russian frontline health care workers, teachers and several top level officials outside the clinical trials.\nThe President cannot use an uncertified vaccine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a call with reporters. Peskov did not explain the difference between the vaccine being certified and approved, but said: Mass vaccination has not started yet. And, of course, the head of state cannot take part in vaccination as a volunteer. Its impossible.\nPeskov said the trials should be completed soon and that Putin would inform people on his decision on whether to take the vaccine if he considers it necessary.\nThe news that Putin hasnt taken the vaccine yet came on the same day that Sputnik Vs developers published new information about the vaccine, touting it as effective, cheap and easy to transport.\nThe Gamaelya institute, which is developing the vaccine, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which finances it, reported more interim data on the vaccine on Tuesday. In a news releases, they said that analysis of data obtained 28 days after the first dose and seven days after the second dose suggests the Sputnik vaccine was 91.4% effective in preventing infections.\nThe release said the researchers identified 39 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the volunteers  31 in the placebo group and eight among those who received the vaccine. It added 18,794 volunteers took part in the study.\nPfizer and Moderna reported similar efficacy rates  94.5% for Moderna and 95% for Pfizer. However, their claims were based on larger sized clinical trials. Moderna reported 95 Covid-19 cases amongst its volunteers  90 in the placebo group and 5 in the vaccinated cohort, while Pfizer reported 170 cases  162 in the placebo group and eight in the participants who received the vaccine.\nAstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70%. It said a total of 131 study participants developed Covid-19 but did not say how many of those people had received the Covid-19 vaccine and how many did not.\nIn a separate statement, the Gamaelya institute and the RDIF said one dose of the vaccine will cost less than $10 on international markets, which they said was two or more times cheaper than mRNA vaccines with similar efficacy levels. The two-dose vaccine and vaccination will be free of charge for Russian citizens, the statement added. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines.\nIn the statement on Tuesday, Russia also said the Sputnik vaccine can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, which is similar to what AstraZeneca said about its vaccine on Monday.\nMeanwhile, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at around -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) while its transported. Moderna said its vaccine can be kept in freezers typically available in pharmacies, and in a refrigerator for 30 days.\nPutin first announced Russias vaccine was approved for public use in August, even though at that point it had been tested only on several dozen subjects in a non-blind study. The announcement came before the start of Phase 3 trials, which are key to establishing its safety and efficacy, and drew skepticism from the international community.\nI know that it works quite effectively, it forms a stable immunity, Putin said at the time, adding that one of his daughters had already taken the jab  a rare move from the President, who is notoriously secretive about his family. He said she had a slightly higher temperature after each dose, but added now she feels well.\nPutin, at 68 years old, is in a high risk group. Vaccine trials for the first group of volunteers aged 60 and over began on October 28, according to Russian state new agency TASS.",

Her characters have permeated music, but in a new version of the film A Star Is Born, she plays Ally, an unknown singer-songwriter who meets Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper).

Now we have the first single, the slow-burning power ballad \"Shallow.\"\nCountry music was a texture in Lady Gaga's 2016 album Joanne. But as NPR Music's Ann Powers put it in her review, country music is \"a genre sometimes strangled by authenticity myths,\" which sets the stage for exactly the kind of \"definitions-busting\" that Gaga favors.\n\"Shallow\" sets the stage for a quiet, reflective country croon, the recording opting to keep in audience noise and their rapturous response. Bradley Cooper, with a sweet and amiable set of pipes, trades verses with Gaga about finding more, wanting more out of life and lovers. But then Gaga's theater kid comes roaring in at the chorus: \"I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in / I'll never meet the ground,\" growling the last word as if every rejection, every ex, every barrier embodies it.

        "content": "Claim:\nA single eruption from a volcano puts 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity has throughout history.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nThe myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate.\nIn a 2009 editorial written for Australias ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: \"Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.\"\nThis brief statement  a mere 28 words  yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic cough? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimers second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality.\nThat useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere.\nAs CO2, in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate  a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus.\nThe erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimers statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center:\nAccording to Houghton and Hackler, land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.\nThe 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2.\nA more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes, as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year (note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO2 not solely the carbon component):\n[CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]:\nUsing the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2.\n[CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]:\nExtrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr.\n[CO2 from other volcanic sources]:\nPerez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr.\nWhile the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year:\nThe global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr.\nOnce again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimers claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic cough from a single volcano to, by itself, increase Earths annual volcanic CO2 flux by a factor of 65.\nAbsurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way:\nThere is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours.\nHowever, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\nOrigin\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\" This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City policy  commonly referred to as the global gag rule. The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot  unlike the global gag rule  be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that bodys sexual and reproductive health agency whose mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled.\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the domestic gag rule  a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. Organizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services, the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations. Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

This image did not appear in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" and it was posted to Pomo's Instagram account on May 30, five days after Floyd's death.\nPomo captioned the image on Instagram:\nNormally youre used to see colorful and cheerful drawings from me, but since ive got quite a good audience, id like to use it as much as i can in the right way when the situation requires it, and bring something good, and useful with my drawings, and you guys know it.\nEspecially in this exact moment.\nWith this piece id like you to think deeply, Taking the chance to bring The Simpsons as an example for the cause. The Simpsons has always been everyones childhood, so the message will be clear and strong enough i suppose.\nImagine youre sat with you daughter/son watching the Simpsons, and all of a sudden this scene happens in the show, as cruel as it has been, no jokes, no irony, nothing that the Simpsons normally has, and what its loved for. Imagine that, how would you feel? ... Think about that deeply, and give yourself an answer, no need to add anything else!\nThe above-displayed collage also implies that \"The Simpsons\" predicted that a police station would be lit on fire.\nAlthough a precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was truly set ablaze, the image in this collection does not show that fire. The photograph in the bottom left corner of this collection actually shows an unfinished housing complex. That photograph is available via The Associated Press and captioned as follows:\nA multi-story affordable housing complex under construction near the Third Precinct, burns on Wednesday, May 27, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minn. Protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer Monday. (Mark Vancleave/Star Tribune via AP)\nThe image on the top left, showing the Springfield police station on fire, truly does come from an episode of \"The Simpsons.\" However, this image has nothing to do with protests, riots, George Floyd, or police violence. Instead, it refers to a joke \"The Simpsons\" made about police incompetence.\nIn the episode \"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\" (Season 11, Episode 6), Homer decides to bypass traffic by driving along the grassy area next to the highway. He is pulled over by Springfield's Police Chief Wiggum, who asks: \"Alright smart guy, where's the fire?\"\nHomer replies \"over there\" and points to a flaming Springfield police station. Chief Wiggum responds: \"Okay, you just bought yourself a 317, pointing out police stupidity... Or is that a 314? Nah nah, 314 is a dog uh, in, no or is that a 315?... You're in trouble pal.\"\nWe have not been able to find a publicly available version of this clip to share in this article, but here's a GIF capturing the moment:\nIn sum, \"The Simpsons\" didn't predict Floyd's death or the resulting protests or fires. The image of Chief Wiggum kneeling on a black man's neck was shared in the days after Floyd's death and didn't appear in an official episode of the show. Although the image of the Springfield police station burning did come from an episode of \"The Simpsons,\" this clip had nothing to do with Floyd or the 2020 protests.",

        "content": "Claim:\nBefore his death, physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith after a visit with Pope Francis.\nThe renowned physicist Stephen Hawking died in March 2018 at the age of 76, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of science, as well as reflections on his inspirational life story.\nOn 14 March 2018, the \"Catholics Online\" Facebook page posted a photograph of Hawking meeting Pope Francis alongside a fabricated claim:\nBefore he died, Stiph [sic] Hawkins [sic] who did not believe in God requested to visit the Vatican. \"Now l believe\" was the only statement he made after the Holy Father blessed him.\nHawking was a longstanding and prominent atheist who often wrote and spoke about the origins of the universe and his views on the notion of a divine Creator (or rather, a lack thereof). As the Washington Post documented after his death, Hawking told the Guardian in 2011 that he did not believe in an afterlife or heaven:\nI regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.\nIn 2010, he told ABC News: \"One can't prove that God doesn't exist, but science makes God unnecessary.\"\nThere is no evidence that Hawking deviated from those lifelong views before his death, and he did not make any declaration of faith after a meeting with Pope Francis.The photograph in the Facebook post shows Hawking and Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016, the last time the two men met. Contrary to the claim, Hawking did not request a private visit with the pontiff; rather, he travelled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.\nHawking was a valued member of the academy, having been appointed to it by Pope Paul VI in 1968. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences listed has among its aims \"fostering interaction between faith and reason and encouraging dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical and religious values.\" After his death, the academy honored Hawking, tweeting a series of photographs of the physicist meeting Popes Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis.\nHowever, notwithstanding his decades-long commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself.\nHawking's phony deathbed conversion is one in a long series of similar hoaxes of opportunity. For example, after the 2011 death of the writer Christopher Hitchens  an outspoken atheist and critic of organized religion  American evangelical Christian writer Larry Alex Taunton published a controversial book in which he claimed Hitchens had reevaluated his religious faith while he was dying of esophageal cancer. The book was widely dismissed and fiercely criticized by friends of Hitchens. Before that, there were debunked eleventh-hour \"conversions\" to Christianity by Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution, and astronomer Carl Sagan.",

He is currently incarcerated in a high-security Mexican prison and is in the process of being extradited to the United States.\nThis article was published on 9 January 2017, and while the author claimed that Assange made the comment at a \"conference\" over the weekend (referring to the 7th and 8th of January), the included photograph was actually taken in February 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder appeared via a video stream for a news conference in which he discussed his possible extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault charge, not improper donations from El Chapo to the Clinton Foundation.\nAs well, Times.com.mx suggested that Assange made his comment in a room full of reporters, yet no legitimate news reports or video clips have surfaced confirming that Assange made any such statment. Furthermore, Times.com.mx did not provide any links to back up their sources or any specific details (such as the time and place of this \"conference\") which could give their report credibility.\nWhile Times.com.mx does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction, this story of theirs is clearly just more fake news.",

His family confirmed that he died early this morning at General Acute Care (GAC) Hospital in California barely [a] couple of hours after he was rushed to the hospital.\nThe article is riddled with errors and fabrications, such as California's \"General Acute Care Hospital\", which does not exist, and a fake tribute from President Donald Trump. Moen's collaborator  Nigerian Christian Contemporary music artist Frank Edwards  confirmed the report is a hoax, tweeting a screenshot of a text message sent by Moen's son Michael, who wrote:\nDad is great and it good health. That article is false and just trying to get people to click thru [sic] to their website. I'll have dad post something on social media shortly so people know.\nOn the day the fake article was published, Moen posted to Facebook.\nThe story itself contains several hallmarks of being fake: an invented hospital; a dubious cause of death (\"stomach pain\") is followed by the contradictory claim that the cause of death was \"not immediately known\"; a quote from Donald Trump is not attributed to any source; a quote from the pastor T.D. Jakes is attributed to \"local media\" but no specific source is named.\nHoustonChronicle-TV.com is not in any way associated with the Houston Chronicle newspaper.",

The photograph seen here is real, however -- but its explanation is an artistic rather than a miraculous one.\nThe person pictured here is artist Rob Ferrel of San Antonio, Texas, who uses a variety of media to create his artworks, including salt and other food products, as reported on Oddity Central:\nA true artist doesnt really need expensive tools and materials to produce something beautiful, and San Antonio artist Rob Ferrel is the perfect example. For months, he has been treating his Instagram followers with highly realist portraits that he creates using nothing but salt, a few brushes, and a piece of cardstock.\nFerrel begins by pouring salt on a table and then moves it around with brushes until recognizable features begin to emerge. He also uses cardstock for clean, sharp lines. Once the portrait is ready, he photographs it and posts it to Instagram, and then gathers up all the salt to make his next masterpiece.\nHis posts regularly get thousands of likes, but some of the more popular portraits are of Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, John Lennon, Lebron James, the cast of Fast & Furious, and The Notorious B.I.G, which he made on a wooden floor.\nBut its not just salt Ferrel works with. The young artist is so talented that he can produce breathtaking art out of pretty much anything. He runs a salon in San Antonio called Rob the Original Barbershop, where he gives customers crazy haircuts sculpted with logos, patterns, and celeb portraits.\nFerrel demonstrated his \"salt art\" during a television appearance on KRPC's Houston Life with hosts Derrick Shore and Courtney Zavala:",

The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

You can hear it on this state broadcast.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Korean).\nMCEVERS: And the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, delivered a message.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nSUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).\nMCEVERS: He said, \"the entire area of the U.S. mainland is within our nuclear strike range. The United States can never start a war against me and our country.\" To talk about the speech, we have reached Evans Revere on Skype. He's an Asia expert and a former State Department official. Welcome to the show.\nEVANS REVERE: It's a pleasure to be with you.\nMCEVERS: Let's start with that statement that Kim Jong Un made about how the U.S. is now within nuclear strike range. I mean, how do you interpret this? What is he trying to do with this speech?\nREVERE: I think the bottom line that he's trying to convey to the United States but also to the international community is that North Korea is and is going to remain a nuclear weapons power. And that reality includes North Korea's ability not only to deter an American attack but to perhaps even threaten the United States itself with a nuclear attack.\nMCEVERS: Do you think this speech is also aimed at a domestic audience as well?\nREVERE: Oh, I think clearly there's a substantial element of domestic politics at work here. He says that the United States cannot attack me, which I thought was an interesting turn of phrase. He's also trying to tell his people that the United States no longer dares to attack North Korea, the DPRK, because North Korea has now, under his leadership, developed this nuclear deterrent.\nMCEVERS: Right. So the idea of the speech is this is the new reality, get used to it, but what about the specific claim that the weapons - that North Korea's nuclear weapons can now reach anywhere in the U.S.? Does that seem possible given what we've seen from North Korea's latest missile tests?\nREVERE: So my assessment of this is that while the threat is there in sort of the theoretical realm, as a practical reality, North Korea has not yet crossed the finish line in terms of actually and credibly being able to threaten the continental United States with a missile-borne nuclear weapon.\nMCEVERS: Yesterday on ABC's \"This Week,\" former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen said this.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\")\nMIKE MULLEN: We're actually closer, in my view, to a nuclear war with North Korea and in that region than we've ever been. And I just don't see the opportunities to solve this diplomatically at this particular point.\nMCEVERS: You have experience negotiating with North Korea on behalf of the U.S. government. Do you have a similar outlook about the possibility for diplomacy here?\nREVERE: Well, I have a similar outlook about the possibility of nuclear war. I think if you look at North Korea's position and you take it literally that they will never give up their nukes, if you look at the U.S. position and take it literally that we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed North Korea, the logical conclusion is that a confrontation of some sort is a distinct possibility - I hope it's not. I hope there is room for diplomacy and dialogue. I think getting to the point of dialogue is one of the things that the U.S. administration is doing now, which is an unprecedented application of economic, trade, diplomatic, political and other sanctions as a way of compelling North Korea, the DPRK, to rethink the course that it is on. We're in uncharted territory here. We've never gone down this track in quite this way when it comes to sanctions and other measures.\nMCEVERS: Of course, in this speech, Kim Jong Un also, surprisingly to some, called for direct talks with South Korea. What did you make of that?\nREVERE: I have been waiting since the Moon Jae-in government came into power...\nMCEVERS: In South Korea.\nREVERE: ...In 2017 for the North Koreans to do precisely what they have done - reach out to South Korea. They are, in their own way, trying to drive a wedge in between the South Koreans and the United States by attracting South Korea, the ROK, into a dialogue since the United States and South Korea have been pretty much in lockstep in applying massive pressure and isolation on North Korea.\nMCEVERS: Evans Revere, senior adviser with the Albright Stonebridge Group and a former State Department official.

The remark at the press confrence came one day after he repeated the claim on his Twitter account. However, as news outlets have pointed out, that figure leaves out the fact that the U.S. has a trade surplus. As a report released by the Commerce Department shows, the actual deficit is $566 billion:\nThe report said:\nThe 2017 increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of $57.5 billion or 7.6 percent to $810.0 billion and a decrease in the services surplus of $3.7 billion or 1.5 percent to $244.0 billion.\nA report published by the White House in February 2018 stated that the U.S. economy has become more dependent on trade involving \"private service-producing industries\" such as engineering, travel, and finance among others:\nTravel (including that for educational purposes) has constituted the largest share of U.S. services exports. Services trade between countries has continued to grow  given declining travel costs, improvements in telecommunications, and growth in online services that allow, for example, computer coding to take place in remote locations. This allows the United States to export high-skilled services to other countries that do not share our\nexpertise and training advantages.\nFocusing on trade of tangible goods alone, the report added, ignored the country's \"comparative advantage\" in service-related trade.\nTrump reiterated his misleading claim on the same day he officially imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum, respectively. Mexico and Canada  the country's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement  are exempted from those tariffs, and other countries will be allowed to petition for separate exemptions. The president's plan to impose the tariffs led to the resignation of White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn on 6 March 2018.",

        "content": "Claim: The US is suffering from a trade imbalance, with a trade deficit of $800bn (579bn) in 2017.\nReality Check verdict: The President is incorrect about the US trade deficit - it was $566bn (410bn) in 2017. Economists generally agree that neither trade deficits nor surpluses are necessarily 'good' or 'bad' for an economy.\nIn a marked change of direction from his predecessors and decades of American trade policy, US President Donald Trump signalled a shift away from free trade towards more protectionist policies by signing two proclamations which levied significant tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium into the United States.\nPart of his justification for the move was his belief that US trade deficits have hurt the US economy.\nIn remarks at the White House announcing the trade tariff plan, President Trump said \"we lose $800bn (578bn) a year on trade, every year\".\nIt's a claim he's made repeatedly, in tweets and speeches.\nWhat's he referring to?\nPresident Trump seems to be citing the fact that the US imported $810bn worth of goods in 2017. That was what he referenced in a June 2016 campaign speech in Pittsburgh, which many in his administration are pointing to now to suggest they've fulfilled a campaign promise.\nBut in doing so, he's ignoring the amount of services the US exported in 2017, which totalled $242.7bn.\nDiscounting that contribution to US trade ignores a significant part of what makes the US economy tick.\nThis is why most economists agree that the US trade deficit in 2017 was $566bn (410bn).\nLike many developed economies, the US has shifted over the past century from an economy primarily focused on manufacturing goods to one that is primarily composed of services. The service sector accounts for 90 million US jobs and 80% of US economic activity, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe biggest US service exports were travel and tourism, financial services like banking, and environmental services.\nWhat about China?\nIn the White House speech, and in recent days, President Trump has taken particular aim at China - saying the US is losing out because of a $500bn trade deficit with China, which he also mentioned during a 5 March speech.\nHowever, the US has never run a trade deficit with China that is above $337bn.\nOver the past ten years, the US has run an annual trade deficit with China that's hovered between $200bn and $300bn.\nAnd when it comes to steel and aluminium imports to the US, China barely ranks.\nAlthough China has nearly half of the world's steel-making capacity according to the OECD, the US imports the majority of its steel from Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico.\nIn 2017, Chinese steel imports accounted for just 2% of the 34 million tonnes of steel the US imported, or 3% of the total value.\nManufacturing jobs lost\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose accept and continue.\nA big reason President Trump has pursued these tariffs is his desire to appeal to manufacturing workers in Democratic swing states like Ohio. He has specifically said he wants to see the US return to being a country that \"makes\" goods.\nIn the past, he's cited statistics that he says indicate that poor trade policies have hurt the US manufacturing sector overall.\nFor instance, in a tweet earlier in the week President Trump said that since President George H.W. Bush came into office in 1989, the US has lost 55,000 factories and six million manufacturing jobs.\nAccording to the US Census bureau, the US actually lost a total of 77,314 manufacturing establishments from 1989 until 2014 (the last year for which data is available).\nHowever, establishments can encompass anything from a traditional factory to something like a bakery or a candy store, so it is hard to definitively say if more than 70,000 factories were lost in the intervening decades.\nIn terms of manufacturing employment, these numbers are slightly exaggerated. The US lost a total of 5.5 million manufacturing jobs since 1989.\nUS manufacturing employment peaked in 1979. It suffered its sharpest declines in employment in the early 1980s. Since then, manufacturing employment in America has been on the decline.\nSome of the decline is certainly due to unfair trade practices - but a large portion of it could be due to automation, which has resulted in fewer workers on factory floors.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions",

        "date": "2019-02-22T22:58:15",
        "content": "When asked whether he would impose tariffs on cars imported from the European Union, President Donald Trump, as he regularly does, used an inflated figure for the trade balance between the U.S. and the EU. The deficit was $101 billion for 2017, not $151 billion, as he repeatedly claims.\nTrump, for years, has been using the goods-only figures for the U.S. trade deficit, instead of the goods-and-services deficit, to justify his trade policies. Since the United States exports a lot of services  such as travel, transportation, finance and intellectual property  Trump skews the trade picture by completely discounting the service trade. The U.S., in fact, has an overall trade surplus in services.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump wrongly claimed again and again that the U.S. trade deficit was nearly $800 billion, a generous rounding-up of the goods-only deficit of $758.9 billion in 2015, the latest figure at the time. The overall goods-and-services deficit was $531.5 billion then. He repeatedly claimed the deficit with China was $500 billion  close to the overall deficit with all countries. (The latest figure for China is $335.7 billion for 2017, despite Trumps assertion on Feb. 15 that a lot of people think its $506 billion.)\nSimilarly, he has distorted the trade figures for Canada and Mexico.\nTrump continues to falsely claim the U.S. has large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, when theres a trade surplus with Canada ($2.8 billion in 2017), and the deficit with Mexico ($68.7 billion) amounts to 11 percent of the total two-way trade with the U.S.\nThe president made his latest false claim about U.S. trade with the EU during an appearance with the federal chancellor of Austria. A reporter asked about a potential tariff Trump has proposed on automobiles and auto parts from the EU. In his response, Trump said:\nTrump, Feb. 20: Theyre very tough to make a deal with  the EU.  If we dont make the deal, well do the tariffs.  But the bottom-line result is whether or not we can make a deal with the EU thats fair. We lose about $151 billion trading with the EU. Thats a lot of money. And this has been going on for many years.\nThats a lot of money, but the wrong figure. Its 50 percent higher than the actual trade deficit with the EU.\nAnd the trade deficit has been going up under Trump. It was $101.2 billion with the EU in 2017, up nearly 10 percent from $92.1 billion in 2016, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published by the Census Bureau. In the last four quarters  from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the third quarter of 2018  the deficit was $113 billion.\nTrump consistently uses the goods-only figure, which also has risen, from $146.8 billion in 2016 to $151.4 billion in 2017 and $154.2 billion in 2018.\nAccording to the Washington Post Fact Checkers database of Trumps claims, the president has repeated his false claim about the EU trade deficit 131 times.\nTotal trade between the EU and U.S. was $1.1 trillion in 2016, and the EU is the largest goods trading partner for the U.S., according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\nEarly last summer, Trump threatened to put a 20 percent tariff on cars exported from the EU to the United States. At the time, the U.S. had added new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including those from the EU, and the EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products. On July 27, the EU and the United States agreed to hold trade negotiations and to not impose further tariffs in the meantime.\nIn an Aug. 21 rally in West Virginia, the president said: We are going to put a 25 percent tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States. And thatll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion dollars and give us a surplus of $151 billion.\nOn Feb. 17, the Commerce Department submitted a study to Trump on how automobile and auto parts imports affect national security. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the president can implement trade restrictions if the Commerce Department finds that imports harm national security. Such a finding was used by Trump to apply the steel and aluminum tariffs last year.",

        "content": "The U.S. trade deficit soared to a 10-year high in 2018 on the heels of a strong economy, despite President Trump's ongoing efforts to bring it down through tariffs on imported goods.\nFor 2018 as a whole, the deficit grew to $621 billion  the highest since 2008, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. When the service sector is excluded, the gap was even greater, rising to a record $891.3 billion.\nThe overall trade deficit has grown by $119 billion in the two years since Trump took office.\nLoading...\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\"We have almost an $800 billion a year trade deficit with other nations,\" Trump said in November 2017. \"Unacceptable. We are going to start whittling that down and as fast as possible.\"\nThe deficit, which is the difference between the goods and services the U.S. buys from other countries and those it sells to them, rose to a seasonally adjusted $59.8 billion in December  an increase of almost 19 percent.\nThe goods trade deficit with China rose to a record $419.2 billion, despite Trump's decision last year to impose tariffs on $50 billion in imports from the country.\nHe has also threatened to raise tariffs on another $200 billion if no progress is made in ongoing negotiations with Beijing.\nTrump also slapped tariffs, which are a kind of tax on imported goods, on steel and aluminum imports, a move that led to retaliation from some U.S. trading partners.\nThe trade gap is growing in large part because the U.S. economy has been strong compared to other major countries. That typically means Americans buy more from other nations.\nMost economists do not consider a trade deficit to be a marker of economic weakness. But Trump has consistently singled out the trade gap as a target in his America First policies. Ironically, the administration's tax cuts may have actually helped to increase the trade deficit by juicing spending on overseas goods by consumers and companies.\nAlso, the dollar strengthened against other currencies in the latter part of 2018, making foreign goods more affordable for Americans. The dollar's climb was partly due to a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.",

        "content": "Caked in filth, the world's most powerful drug baron hauled himself from a manhole.\nFor Joaqun \"El Chapo\" Guzmn, whose feats of escapology were matched only by his drug-smuggling acumen, it was a trademark yet ultimately futile manoeuvre. The 17 Mexican marines raiding his ranch nearby would catch him soon enough.\nSix months earlier, he had humiliated Mexican authorities by fleeing Mexico's most secure prison, his second jailbreak in two decades. This time he would not slip through their fingers, although those who caught him were left in no doubt how angry he was to have been arrested.\n\"You are all going to die,\" he warned police in the hours after his capture in Los Mochis, north-west Mexico, on 8 January 2016.\nThree years on, Guzmn has been handed a life sentence, plus 30 years, after being found guilty of international drug smuggling in a lurid three-month trial that exposed his criminal empire.\nAt his sentencing in New York, Guzmn said he had received an unfair trial and his treatment in solitary confinement was tantamount to torture.\n\"We're never going to see his like again,\" Douglas Century, the author of the book Hunting El Chapo, told the BBC.\nGuzmn was the oldest of seven children born into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico.\nHis parents - Emilio Guzmn Bustillos and Mara Consuelo Loera Prez - earned their living from farming. His father was officially a cattle rancher but is believed to have been an opium poppy farmer, Malcolm Beith writes in his book, The Last Narco.\nGuzmn's enterprising spirit was apparent from a young age. He would support his family by selling oranges to peasant farmers for a few pesos. His penchant for the spoils of wealth didn't go unnoticed, either. In a Vice News podcast, Guzmn's younger sister Bernarda said he would wear fake gold jewellery when visiting family members.\n\"Even as a little child, he had ambitions,\" his mother told filmmakers in 2014. She recalled he had \"a lot of paper money\" which he would count and recount.\nHis first foray into organised crime came at the age of 15, when he cultivated his own marijuana plantation with his cousins. Then, he adopted the nickname \"El Chapo\" - Mexican slang for \"Shorty\". But his ambitions belied his diminutive stature (he is only 5ft 6ins, or 1.64m).\nIn his late teens, Guzmn left La Tuna to seek his fortune in drug smuggling. \"He always fought for a better life,\" his mother said.\nGuzmn's reputation for ruthless efficiency was duly noted. In the 1980s he was introduced to Miguel ngel Flix Gallardo - known as the Godfather of the Guadalajara cartel - who put him in charge of handling logistics.\nWhen Flix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, his cartel's drug trafficking territories were divided among different factions, later known as The Federation. Guzmn was a beneficiary, setting up his own Sinaloa cartel with other traffickers in north-west Mexico.\nIn the 1990s, he honed his operation, pioneering the use of sophisticated underground tunnels to move drugs across the border.\n\"He was the go-to guy,\" David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, told the BBC. \"When the United States started shutting down ports of entry in the Atlantic and Pacific in the 1990s, drugs had to go through Mexico. And if it had to go through Mexico, it had to go through El Chapo.\"\nHe invested his proceeds wisely, not only expanding his enterprise, but building infrastructure that benefited locals in Sinaloa too. This cemented his popularity. \"You are Santa Claus. And everybody likes Santa Claus,\" Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico's former ambassador in Washington, told the New Yorker in 2014.\nOver time, Guzmn's cartel became one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US and in 2009, he entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (709m).\nAs his wealth and empire grew, so too did scrutiny from law enforcement. \"The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been after him for decades,\" Mr Weinstein said.\nIn 1993, a Roman Catholic cardinal was shot dead in a turf war with rival drug smugglers. Guzmn was among those blamed and a bounty was placed on his head by the Mexican government. His moustachioed face, previously unknown to the public, started appearing in newspapers and on TV screens. Within weeks, he was arrested in Guatemala and he was later sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, drug trafficking and bribery.\nA prison psychological profile described him as \"egocentric, narcissistic, shrewd, persistent, tenacious, meticulous, discriminating, and secretive\", according to the New Yorker. In prison, he enjoyed a life of luxury, smuggling in lovers, prostitutes and Viagra, according to reports in Mexico.\nEight years behind bars was enough for Guzmn. In January 2001, he broke out of a top-security jail, Puente Grande. He did so, as the myth goes, in a laundry cart. What's more likely, multiple journalists and authors argue, is that he simply walked out of the door with the help of corrupt guards.\nGuzmn controlled the prison to such an extent he escaped in police uniform, Mexican journalist Anabel Hernndez wrote in her book, Narcoland. Guzmn would spend the next decade evading authorities and consolidating his power as Mexico's pre-eminent drug smuggler. In that period, he always seemed to be one step ahead of would-be captors and rival cartels.\n\"He's a micro-manager,\" said Mr Century, who co-authored his book with Andrew Hogan, the undercover DEA agent who caught Guzmn in 2014. \"In the text messages we have, he's in the weeds of every single minor facet of his drug operation.\"\nSex was his other preoccupation, Mr Century said. \"He had more mistresses than you can probably fathom. This was his existence: having sex with strange women and micro-managing every detail of his operation.\"\nAfter 13 years on the run, Guzmn was captured by Mexican marines called in by Mr Hogan in February 2014. Guzmn's second prison break, in July 2015, was arguably even more fantastical than the first. This time, his accomplices used GPS to burrow a 1.5km (one mile) tunnel that led directly underneath his cell in Altiplano prison in central Mexico.\nThe escape was elaborate and carefully planned. The tunnel had ventilation, lighting and stairs and the exit was hidden by a construction site. Mexican TV stations later aired footage that showed that guards failed to act when loud hammering was heard from inside Guzmn's cell.\nGuzmn had embarrassed Mexico's government for the second time, leaving then-President Enrique Pea Nieto \"deeply troubled\" and \"outraged\".\nHis freedom, however, was short-lived. In January 2016, Guzmn was tracked down to a house in an affluent part of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Five of Guzmn's guards were killed in the raid by Mexican marines and he managed to flee out of a manhole, but was caught in a car while leaving town. One year later, he was extradited to the US.\nHis Achilles' heel, Mr Century told the BBC, was his narcissism. He was reaching out to actors and directors to commission screenplays about his life, Mr Century said. His communication with actors and producers gifted Mexico's attorney general a new line of investigation.\n\"When he escaped from prison in 2015, he probably could have run away to the mountains and just lived,\" Mr Century said. Instead, Guzmn made the unprecedented move of granting an exclusive interview to Hollywood actor Sean Penn in October 2015. It was a decision that may have cost him his freedom.\n\"I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats,\" he said in the interview published in Rolling Stone magazine. After his capture it was speculated - though never formally confirmed - that Mexican authorities found Guzmn by tracking Penn. \"He contacted actresses and producers, which was part of one line of investigation,\" said Mexico's attorney general, Arely Gmez.\nHis beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, she said, \"looked bored most of the time\" - even when Guzmn's former mistress testified. While Coronel remained placid, the trial's astonishing moments shocked others.\nOne witness, for example, told the court Guzmn buried a man alive. Another told of a rival narco chief who refused to shake Guzmn's hand - and paid for it with his life. Court papers also accused him of drugging and raping girls as young as 13, calling them his \"vitamins\".\nThe scale of his drug trafficking operation was laid bare, too.\nAssistant US Attorney Adam Fels alleged that Guzmn had sent the equivalent of more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the US in just four shipments. And to protect his businesses, a bribe of $100m (77m) was paid to former President Pea Nieto when he took office in 2012, it was alleged in court. Mr Pea Nieto strenuously denies the allegation.\nWhen Guzmn's guilty verdict was read aloud, his mouth was \"agape\" and he looked \"vaguely stunned\", the New York Times reported.\nIn a trial that attracted podcasters, screenwriters and true-crime obsessives, some observers said the media attention trivialised the proceedings. The intention was quite the contrary, our correspondent said. The trial was meant to be a public spectacle to show what El Chapo and his henchmen had done and to send a warning to others, she said.\nThe title of Mr Beith's book, The Last Narco, suggests Guzmn is one of a dying breed of ultra-violent drug barons as bloodthirsty as they are shrewd.\nYet, while Guzmn is likely to die behind bars, Mexico's drug-smuggling problem is likely to outlive him. In his Rolling Stone interview, Guzmn said it was false to assume drug trafficking would cease \"the day I don't exist\".\nFor all his supposed vanity and self-confidence, not even Guzmn can claim to be the last narco.",

        "content": "Just after midday on Tuesday 12 February, word came down that the verdict was ready in what had been widely described as the trial of the century. United States of America v Joaqun Guzmn Loera had lasted approximately three months  it took prosecutors that long to present what they described as an avalanche of evidence, which had taken more than a decade to compile. The government called 56 witnesses, the defence called only one: an FBI agent, who finished testifying within an hour.\nThere was little expectation that Guzmn would mount a convincing defence. The diminutive 61-year-old (his nickname, El Chapo, means shorty in Spanish) was known around the world as a leader of Mexicos Sinaloa cartel, and the most high-profile drug kingpin since Pablo Escobar. In addition to smuggling thousands of tonnes of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and synthetic narcotics across the US-Mexico border, he had successfully pulled off two dramatic escapes from prisons in Mexico. He has been the subject of dozens of books, two popular TV series and, in 2009, was included in Forbes magazines list of billionaires. The following year, that same magazine named Guzmn one of the worlds most-wanted fugitives, second to only Osama bin Laden. As Guzmns lawyers liked to tell anybody who would listen, even before their client set foot in Brooklyn, he had already been convicted in the court of public opinion.\nWhen he was captured by Mexican marines on 8 January 2016, Guzmn became the prize feather in the cap of the countrys law enforcement. Barack Obama called Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto to congratulate him on the arrest, and in a move that could be interpreted either as a parting gift to Obama or a peace offering to his successor, Guzmn was extradited to New York on 19 January 2017, a day before Trump took office. Jack Riley, a retired Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) chief who recently published a book about his role in Guzmns arrest, told me that in the view of US authorities, catching El Chapo was an important warning to criminals around the world. Regardless of where you are, if you are breaking American laws, eventually, were going to get you.\nAmericans spend around $109bn on illegal drugs each year, and Bloomberg estimates that the Sinaloa cartel makes at least $11bn in annual sales to the US. But while Mexican cartels regularly appear in the US media, most people are unfamiliar with the circumstances that contributed to their rise. It is not common knowledge that Mexico launched its own war on drugs in the mid-2000s, or that the biggest cartels are sophisticated operations worth billions of dollars. Nor are many people aware that cartels are increasingly responsible for fentanyl, a form of synthetic heroin, entering the US. In an address to the media after the verdict was handed down, US government officials emphasised this point and the role of illegal fentanyl in perpetuating the opioids crisis.\nWhile the workings of his business may be a mystery, Americans have heard of El Chapo. By the time he appeared in court in 2018, he was a late-night TV punchline, a symbol of extreme wealth and an escape artist with a talent for leaving law enforcement with their hands empty.\nAt the trial, Guzmn was found guilty of all charges against him, including the most serious  having engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise. He will be sentenced at the end of June, and is almost certain to be jailed for life. His lawyers are seeking a retrial on the basis of jury misconduct, but the chances of that happening are slim.\nWhen I was in Mexico City this spring, a month after the verdict, talk of the trial had already died down. Guzmns image had mostly disappeared from the magazine covers on display at the news kiosks that dot the streets of the capital. While people could still name the Sinaloa cartels leaders and lieutenants, they were more interested in the newer cartels, such as Jalisco Nueva Generacin or the local La Unin. Many people didnt want to discuss El Chapo at all. Narco fatigue  the exhaustion that comes with being oversaturated by news and pop culture about the drug trade  had long ago set in. Over the past 13 years, Mexicos internal war on drugs has dominated the media, resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and failed to stop narcotrafficking.\nGuzmns arrest did not magically rid Mexico, or the US, of violence or drugs. Above all, his trial demonstrated how disposable any single person is in the larger machinations of the narco-state. There has never been a clear definition of what exactly constitutes a cartel, and as smaller, more transient gangs replace larger organisations, going after leaders like Guzmn seems increasingly pointless. Rather than reducing the levels of violence and trafficking in Mexico, that approach  the so-called kingpin strategy, employed by Mexico and the US  has enabled new forms of crime to flourish. As Ismael El Mayo Zambada, Chapos longtime partner, said in 2010 in a rare interview with the Mexican news magazine El Proceso, the problem of narcos isnt going away: As soon as capos are locked up, killed or extradited, their replacements are already around.\nSince the early 1990s, the US has targeted cartels via their leaders. It is a fairly straightforward idea: take out the head of an illegal organisation and the rest will collapse. The approach was developed to bring down the Colombian cartels, and in that case, it had some success. When Pablo Escobar was shot to death by Colombian police in 1993, his cartel went down with him.\nBut even as the structures of organised crime have evolved, US law enforcement has generally stuck to this top-down model. If they are not killing drug lords, they are using the American judicial system to make examples of them. Since 2001, when Mexicos supreme court agreed to allow the extradition of criminals so long as they would not face the death penalty or life in prison (this ruling was amended four years later to permit life sentences), dozens of narcotraffickers have been extradited to the US, including members of the Tijuana, Beltrn-Leyva, Sinaloa and Los Zetas cartels. If Guzmn ends up in the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as he is expected to, he will share the facility with former Gulf cartel leader Osiel Crdenas Guilln.\nWhile Sinaloa has historically been, and still remains, Mexicos most powerful cartel, the world it came up in no longer exists. Between the early 90s and the mid-2000s, the Sinaloa, Tijuana, Jurez and Gulf organisations were mini-monopolies, with borders that more or less stayed the same. Then, with the start of Mexicos drug war in 2006, that arrangement started to fall apart. As Mexican and American authorities took out cartel leaders, groups fractured and new ones emerged.\nPreviously, the Zetas, whose leaders came from the special forces of the Mexican army, had been a mercenary group in the employ of the Gulf cartel. Now they became an autonomous organisation. Jalisco Nueva Generacin, which had been linked to Sinaloa, morphed into one of Mexicos most ferocious cartels. Splinter groups and gangs that had originated in prisons or as local militias began to gain power.\nThis fragmentation altered the way cartels do business. To distinguish themselves in a crowded field, the new groups pioneered the use of sadistic, headline-grabbing violence. They also diversified. Whereas an old-school cartel might have once only sold drugs, the upstarts are expanding into different forms of crime. The Zetas are notorious for stealing petrol from nationalised pipelines and selling it on the black market  a business that Sinaloa previously dominated, as journalist Ana Lilia Perz documented in her book El Cartel Negro. The Santa Rosa de Lima cartel also specialises in petrol theft, known nationally as huachicol. Protection rackets are common. And cartels are kidnapping and extorting migrants on their way to the US border. In 2010, the bodies of 72 Central American migrants were found on a ranch in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. According to the lone survivor of the massacre, an 18-year-old Ecuadorian, the Zetas murdered the group when they refused to either pay for their freedom or serve as cartel hitmen.\nAt the same time, older cartels are expanding and decentralising. According to law and economics scholar Edgardo Buscaglia, Sinaloa has a presence in 54 countries and Jalisco Nueva Generacin, one of Mexicos fastest growing cartels, is said to have branched out throughout the Americas. Maintaining such operations requires a vast and diverse network of legal fronts and elaborate systems of money-laundering. To illustrate this point, the journalist Diego Osorno recently noted that the most popular brand of milk in Sinaloa is made by a company owned by Guzmns colleague El Mayo. The Sinaloa cartel operates on such a large scale  connecting manufacturers and distributors, bankers and businesses and extracting money at each step  that there is no longer a single face of the organisation. Buscaglia told me that that if I wanted to see the sophisticated side of the Sinaloa cartel, I should visit a particular gated community in Argentina. I wouldnt find any gangsters flashing guns, he clarified, only the wealthy managers of the cartels legal operations in that country.\nThis fragmentation also means that cartels and low-level gangs are harder to police and prosecute. Paradoxically, there are also more mini-kingpins to capture. And once they are in the US, narcotraffickers can cut plea deals and help prosecutors capture their former bosses and colleagues. Captured Mexican narcos generally have few qualms about cooperating. A good outcome might mean a radically reduced sentence and half their fortune waiting for them on release. An even better outcome might resemble that of Andrs Lpez Lpez, one of the former leaders of Colombias Norte del Valle cartel. In 2006, Lpez had an 11-year sentence knocked down to 20 months after working with authorities. Now based in Miami, he has written three books about trafficking, one of which was adapted into a wildly successful TV show in Latin America. His most recent book, which was also optioned for television, is a biography of El Chapo.\nI first went to the Guzmn trial in early December, and began to go more frequently as a broader picture of cartel operations came into focus. In building the case, prosecutors approached it like a classic mafia roll-up, offering leniency to each captured narco and gradually working their way up the chain until they reached Guzmn. As Miami defence attorney Joaquin Perez, who has represented many extradited narcotraffickers, told me, it was a significant effort for a fait accompli.\nIt also made for good theatre. There were accounts of diamond-encrusted guns and cocaine stash houses in fancy Brooklyn neighbourhoods, million-dollar smuggling submarines capable of evading police radars and elaborate schemes to outwit US law enforcement. Week after week, witnesses described in intricate detail the inner workings of la oficina (the internal nickname for the cartel): its lavish displays of violence and wealth, its complex transportation networks and how Mexican authorities were systematically paid off. In search of material, screenwriters and actors showed up at the trial.\nTabloid headlines advertised the wacky world of the trial, and newspapers ran lists of its most bizarre disclosures. By the time the prosecution rested after 11 weeks of testimony, jurors had heard from Juan Carlos Ramrez Abada, AKA Chupeta (lollipop), a formerly handsome Colombian kingpin who had undergone such extensive plastic surgery to stay in hiding that his face looked like a rubber Halloween mask; Jorge and Alex Cifuentes-Villa, brothers and Colombian career criminals who had worked closely with Guzmn; and Lucero Guadalupe Snchez Lpez, Guzmns mistress and one-time accomplice. Jorge Cifuentes-Villa described attempting to kill a man with a poisoned sandwich, and Alex told the jury that Guzmn had allegedly boasted about bribing former president Pea Nieto for $100m. (Pea Nietos former chief of staff described this claim as false, defamatory and absurd.)\nYet to many of the seasoned narco corresponsales, the trial offered few newsworthy revelations. Everything that was astonishing to American audiences was not to Mexicans, said David Brooks, the US correspondent for the progressive Mexican newspaper La Jornada. Mexican readers were no longer scandalised by accounts of extreme wealth or violence. Besides sex and infidelity, which were of universal interest, Brooks told me that the stories that landed with his readers were ones that named names, confirming that long-suspected officials had taken bribes or worked both sides of the table.\nThe more I spoke with the Mexican journalists, the more I became aware of the underlying issues going unaddressed in the courtroom. There were few mentions of the consequences of the war on drugs, which had led to the deaths of thousands of Mexicans. And because it was being held in the US, some saw the case as a finger in the eye of Mexican sovereignty, a serious injury to national pride. (There was some irritation over the fact that Guzmn was being tried, as several journalists grumbled, in a court where the judge couldnt properly pronounce his name.)\nAt the same time, nobody seemed to think the trial should have been held in Mexico, where the police and judicial systems were too weak to guarantee that Guzmn wouldnt escape jail for a third time. Again and again, I spoke with journalists and academics who described corruption in Mexico as something like a tide, a force that grew steadily and drew everything towards it. Police were underpaid, crime was lucrative and the government was compromised by the cartels. Political corruption, usually through campaign contributions or by laundering money through public procurement projects, is standard. When I asked people in Mexico City about the enthusiasm surrounding the new president Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador, who took office in December 2018, I often heard that his willingness to take on corruption was his main selling point.\nThe basic problem in Mexico, Buscaglia told me, is that nobody is policing the courts. Mexico doesnt audit judges or prosecutors, and lacks independent monitoring agencies. Despite recent reforms to the criminal justice system, Buscaglia does not think that Mexico currently has the capacity or political will to execute major organised crime cases like Italy did with its famous Maxi trial in the late 1980s. There, Sicilian prosecutors indicted 475 mafiosi over a six-year period. That, he added, indicates the most significant difference between Mexico and Italy: organised crime didnt infiltrate the Mexican state  it helped shape it. Politics in Mexico, Buscaglia likes to tell people, is the most sophisticated form of organised crime.\nDid the state shape the cartels, or was it the other way around? The standard narrative is that the cartels infiltrated the state, blurring the lines between police, politicians and traffickers. Others contend that government authorities exaggerated the power of the cartels in order to blame them for their own transgressions. It is possible some version of each is true. Either way, there is no single force in control.\nThere has never been a hard divide between the state and traffickers in Mexico. In the 1920s, farmers began growing poppy to meet US demand for opium, and after the second world war, representatives of what would become Mexicos Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) were rumoured to have made handshake deals with smugglers, allowing them to export illicit crops across the border in exchange for a cut of the profits. The PRI was the de facto government for most of the 20th century  the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa once called Mexico under the PRI the perfect dictatorship  and during its tenure, politicians generally took a lax attitude towards the drug trade, regarding drugs as more of a health issue than a criminal one.\nBy the 1980s, narcos had solidified their power by divvying up trafficking routes and letting groups run their own territories. At the time cocaine trafficking was starting to become big business in Mexico. When the US DEA began targeting Colombian cocaine distribution routes between the Caribbean and Miami, the cartels had found an alternative in the Mexican trampoline. Traffickers started moving shipments across the porous US-Mexico border, and American officials redirected their attention to Mexico. From 1985 onwards, US operations in Mexico became more aggressive, following the kidnap, torture and murder of a DEA agent by the Guadalajara cartel. With the cold war receding, drugs replaced communism as the enemy No 1 of the American people.\nThe Americans did not find the Mexican authorities the most co-operative of partners in the war on drugs. By the 80s and 90s, writes the sociologist Luis Alejandro Astorga Almanza, it was practically impossible for society to ignore the unbreakable links between police and traffickers. Particularly in states such as Tamaulipas, cops would moonlight as traffickers  and traffickers as cops  with the tacit blessing of local authorities and elites. Various governmental structures seem to have been born captured by the illicit interests of their own creators, writes Carlos Antonio Flores Perz, a social anthropologist who studies the institutional protection of the drug trade. US army intelligence cables from the 80s and early 90s reveal that American officials were fully aware that all over Mexico, officials, politicians and state and federal police were in on the take.\nIn April 1989, Miguel ngel Flix Gallardo, the former police officer who founded the infamous Guadalajara cartel, was arrested, but like Escobar, he continued to run his cartel from prison. That year, his most powerful lieutenants  one of whom was a young Guzmn  assembled in Acapulco and were each assigned a territory. El Chapo and El Mayo took the Pacific coast. This kingmaker moment ushered in a new era, and preceded yet another big shift. Instead of continuing to accept cash from weakened Colombian suppliers, Mexican narcos began demanding payment in cocaine so they could go into business on their own. Before long, they went from being couriers to distributors, which was far more profitable, and overtook their former employers as the worlds biggest traffickers.\nWhile agreements between cartels and Mexican authorities had previously kept violence between the two at bay, by the late 80s these relationships were strained. With the US putting more pressure on the Mexican government to target traffickers, the old arrangements dissolved. Under these new circumstances, violence became common among gangs, writes Sinaloan historian Froyln Enciso, and a way of confronting the government.\nStill, it rarely spilled into public view. So the country was stunned when in May 1993, a Mexican cardinal was killed in a shootout between the Tijuana and Sinaloa cartels at Guadalajara airport. Although it was later discovered that Tijuana sicarios had mistaken the cardinals car for Guzmns  they were retaliating for a Sinaloa attack that killed nine Tijuana members  he was initially blamed. A nationwide manhunt was called, and with Guzmn splashed all over the papers, he became a household name in Mexico.\nIn June 1993, he was captured in Guatemala, extradited to Mexico and later sentenced to 20 years in jail for drug trafficking and murder. But for the next eight years, until he escaped in 2001  allegedly hidden in a laundry cart pushed by a guard  Guzmn, like Flix Gallardo before him, continued to run his business from jail without any difficulties.\nIn the early 2000s, after Guzmns first escape from jail, Sinaloa began to expand. The organisation moved into the markets for meth and fentanyl and, as opioid addiction gained momentum in the US, Guzmn approached it like a shrewd businessman. According to Jack Riley, the former DEA head in Chicago, between 2010 and 2014, the cartel increased the flow of Colombian and Mexican heroin because [Guzmn] saw the prescription drug problem taking over.\nWhile this pattern played out across the US, Sinaloas power and logistical strength were concentrated in Chicago, the main hub from which they distributed drugs around the country. Cartel operations were so well organised, said Riley, that you could hit a house with 50 kilos of heroin in it, and two doors down you could hit a house with $5m in it, and neither of the people running the houses even knew the other existed.\nEven as Sinaloa grew, Mexico was relatively peaceful. From the 1990s until 2006, Mexicos homicide rate fell by nearly half, reaching the lowest levels in its history. Then, in late 2006, everything changed. Just over a week after the conservative Felipe Caldern took office, following a bitterly controversial election that he won by a margin of just 0.6%, he declared an internal war on drugs, sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacn. To his critics, this new war on drugs looked like a bid to divert attention from accusations of election fraud.\nCalderns announcement initiated what would become one of the deadliest periods in Mexican history. With billions in funding from the US, Caldern pursued his own version of the kingpin strategy, deploying the military to fight cartels and targeting their leaders. During his six-year tenure, 25 of Mexicos most wanted  two-thirds of the entire list  were arrested or killed. As cartels pushed back, extortion and kidnappings spiked, and the number of homicides reached an average of 20,000 a year. In this new atmosphere of fear, wrote novelist Juan Villoro in an essay about the era, 10,000 companies offer security services and 3,000 people have had chips inserted under their skin so they can be located if theyre kidnapped.\nDespite this violence, Sinaloa seemed to receive less attention from the authorities than other cartels. An investigation by the US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR) reported that between December 2006 and May 2010, Sinaloa members were arrested at significantly lower rates than those of rival groups. A congressman from Sinaloa also told NPR that the government has been fighting organised crime in many parts of the republic, but has not touched Sinaloa. Explanations for this varied from low-level corruption in the armed forces to more elaborate conspiracies involving the government  accusations that Caldern told reporters were totally unfounded, naming various Sinaloa members that the government had arrested.\nIn the next general election, in 2012, the PRI retook power and Pea Nieto became president. Although his administration retreated from the kingpin strategy, in 2014, more than a decade after he had first escaped from prison, Guzmn was recaptured and sent to the maximum-security Altiplano federal prison. The following year, he escaped once again, before he was recaptured for the final time in 2016. Mission complete, tweeted Pea Nieto.\nAfter a year of negotiations and intense international pressure, Guzmn was extradited to New York in January 2017. If his capture had any effect on the violence in Mexico, it wasnt immediately positive: 2017 was the deadliest year in modern Mexican history, with a total of 23,101 homicides. It is not clear exactly how many of these deaths and disappearances were linked to organised crime, but scholars have noted that a culture of impunity certainly contributed to the violence. Less than 2% of homicide cases in Mexico result in indictments. By the time Pea Nieto left office in 2018, the number of people killed since 2006 had risen above 250,000, with a further 31,000 declared missing. Targeting leaders had fractured the cartel landscape, and new gangs were rushing in to fill the gaps.\nDrug trafficking and cartel violence affect both the US and Mexico, but when it comes to addressing them, the US government has typically strongarmed Mexico into following its lead. Long before the overt bullying of the Trump administration, American officials were known to pay little heed to Mexican sovereignty. Yet even when US violations of that sovereignty pertained to the trial, they were rarely discussed in court.\nOne notable example was the Fast and Furious scandal, which the judge in Guzmns trial explicitly barred from mention on the grounds that it would confuse the jury. In this staggeringly ill-advised scheme, US law enforcement agents encouraged gun dealers in Arizona to sell to traffickers believed to be connected to the Mexican cartels, in order to track the weapons and see where they ended up. The first part of this plan succeeded. Between 2009 and 2011, more than 2,000 weapons were purchased in the gunwalking operation, and it erupted into the news when a border agent was killed with one. A congressional review later revealed that ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives] leadership knew that Fast and Furious weapons were heading to the Sinaloa cartel, and Attorney General [Eric] Holder was sent several memos in 2010 notifying him that the Sinaloa cartel was buying them. An estimated 150 injuries and homicides resulted from the programme, and one of the weapons, a Barrett .50-calibre rifle, was found in Guzmns hideout after he was last captured.\nEven in less dramatic instances, the business as usual of international law enforcement is fraught. Writing for El Proceso, J Jess Esquivel described the Guzmn trial as having exposed betrayals, corruption, lies and regular violations of Mexican sovereignty by DEA agents. Esquivel also zeroed in on cooperating witness deals that the justice department offered to certain traffickers, including Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of El Mayo and Sinaloas heir apparent. El Vicentillo was one of the trials most anticipated witnesses. He was flown in from Chicago, where he had yet to be sentenced on his own trafficking charges, and took the stand in dark blue prison clothes. In a five-hour testimony that the New York Times described as a spectacular betrayal of his father and birthright, Zambada Niebla gave a detailed insider account of cartel workings, describing how the organisation spent at least $1m a month on bribes to police and politicians, and detailing a failed plot to use a government petrol tanker to transport South American cocaine to Mexico.\nFor taking the stand against his compadre, as he politely referred to Guzmn, the 44-year-old was promised a shorter sentence and a possible path to US citizenship. Others were given similar offers. The Cifuentes brothers, who sent tonnes of drugs to cities all over the US, may serve less than 15 years for their cooperation. Even Chupeta, the Colombian trafficker who confessed to having ordered the killings of 150 people  and to having personally shot one man in the face  may be free in 10-15 years for his testimony.\nIn his plea agreement, Zambada Niebla also agreed to forfeit $1.37bn (yes, billion) to the US government, although it is highly unlikely any money will actually change hands. Since narcos dont purchase property or open bank accounts in their own names, it can be difficult to locate assets, and if the money is in Mexico, US authorities rarely bother to track it down. Of course, there is no public information about how many narcos are in witness protection, or whether those living under assumed identities have managed to recoup some of their former fortunes. But it is not far-fetched to assume this could happen: on 30 May, a federal judge in Chicago sentenced Vicentillo to 15 years in prison. With time served, this leaves him with five years to go, which may be further reduced for good behaviour.\nOutside the courtroom, away from the trial, the US-Mexico relationship is also defined by a kind of mutual obliviousness on the part of each countrys citizens. David Brooks, the Jornada reporter, told me there is still mass ignorance about whats happening next door. In Mexico, he observed, Trump coming to power reinforced every stereotype of America for the past hundred years. At the same time, while there are 36 million Mexican Americans in the US, Americans are generally ignorant of whats happening below the border. One thing that has gone notably unnoticed, according to Brooks, is the victory of left populist Lpez Obrador. Since he took office in December 2018, Mexico has entered a moment of potential transformation, which, if the new president follows through on his promises, could reshape the way Mexico deals with drug trafficking.\nA month after the verdict, I met journalist Ioan Grillo in the middle-class area of Roma in Mexico City, several blocks from the house where Alfonso Cuarn had shot his Oscar-winning film, and next to a Sinaloan seafood restaurant. Grillo had recently written an opinion piece rejecting the idea that Guzmns conviction was a victory in the war on drugs. To bring a real sense of justice, youd need something like a war crimes tribunal, he observed. Grillo was building on a point that had been made repeatedly by members of the Mexican press at the trial  the case did not seem not to acknowledge how the war on drugs led to thousands of deaths and profoundly altered Mexican society.\nThere were mixed feelings in Mexico, Grillo added  not about whether Guzmn should go to jail, but about what justice should look like, what closure his conviction could offer and what the whole trial ultimately meant. This was the biggest trial in a drug war that has lasted more than a decade, and it didnt even take place in Mexico. No actionable evidence against any officials had emerged, and Grillo said most Mexicans were not particularly surprised to hear any of the corruption allegations that the case brought to the surface.\nEl Chapos capture did not have any impact on drug trafficking or consumption, and there is no reason to think his sentence will, either. In 2018, a DEA report found that drug overdoses in the US had hit record highs, and that cocaine and heroin use was on the rise. In Mexico, where drug use has historically been very low, the numbers are steadily climbing: in 2016, 9.9% of the population said they had tried illegal drugs, up from 4.1% in 2002. Moreover, under the leadership of El Mayo and Guzmns sons, Ivn and Alfredo, Sinaloa has continued to operate. Just as the trial was ending, Arizona officials announced the largest fentanyl seizure in history from a truck coming from Sinaloa territory; and, in mid-April, a presidential candidate in Guatemala was arrested for accepting a bribe from the Sinaloa cartel in exchange for appointing their people to high-ranking government positions.\nWhat is changing in Mexico is the nature of violence. Kate Linthicum, the Mexico City bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times, says that in the past several years she has watched violence become more localised in small gangs and contract criminals with shifting affiliations. This has corresponded with a rise in narcomenudeo, small-scale street trafficking and other forms of crime, including petrol theft. Because Mexicos petrol industry is nationalised, the robberies cost the government more than $3bn a year. Since Lpez Obrador made it one of his signature issues, petrol theft has become a front-page staple. The thieves are usually associated with local gangs or cartels, and are often assisted by Mexican Petroleum employees. At the beginning of January, Lpez Obrador shut off Mexican Petroleum pipelines to stop smuggling, causing a national shortage that lasted for days. This enraged petrol cartels, but burnished his popularity: a national poll found that more than 80% of Mexicans approved of the move.\nIt is clear the public wants reform, but the question is whether Lpez Obrador will be able to do anything about the corruption that has for so long hobbled the state, including parts of his own administration. Three days after Guzmns sentencing, Lpez Obrador visited Badiraguato, the kingpins hometown. Guzmn is by no means a popular figure in Mexico, but in Sinaloa, one of the countrys most dangerous regions, T-shirts with his face on them are sold in markets and he is widely regarded as a local hero. In a state where the federal government is largely absent, El Chapo is credited (without any evidence) with building roads and providing social services. After he was apprehended for the second time in 2014, hundreds of people turned out to demand his release.\nDuring his visit, Lpez Obrador promised jobs to the towns young people and vowed to make sure that they would not be obliged to take antisocial paths. That was four months ago. The jobs havent yet materialised, but it was the first time residents could recall a president visiting the region.\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

        "content": "Claim:\nOn Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration's desire to be on good terms with the European Union.\nApproximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.\nOne conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform's captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said.\nTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation  whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason  we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden's speech.\nConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:\n\"Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.\"\nWhile saying \"I'm eager to hear,\" Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant \"mmmm\" in the word \"I'm\" blended with the next word, \"eager,\" to make a \"mnnm-eager\" sound. That was the source of the social media posts' allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker's reason for saying it.\nA more plausible reason for the president's phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.\nOn several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound), according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.\nIn other words, the claim is false  Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.",

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.\nIn February 2021, a few weeks after Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, a few social media users appeared to be in denial of reality as they held on to the idea that former President Donald Trump was somehow still the commander in chief. When a photo of Biden in the Oval Office started circulating online, they claimed that the photo was not taken at the White House but actually showed a movie set:\nThis photograph was taken on Feb. 5, 2021, as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a meeting in the actual Oval Office to discuss their COVID-19 relief package. ABC News reported:\nIn an Oval Office meeting with House Democrats on Friday, Biden recounted how as vice president, then-President Barack Obama had tasked him with pushing through legislation on Capitol Hill to address the recession.\n\"It was hard as hell to get the votes for it to begin with, and then it was hard as hell to get even the number we got,\" Biden said at the start of the gathering. \"But one thing we learned is, you know, we can't do too much here; we can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.\"\nThe claim that this photograph was taken on a movie set is based entirely on what appears, at first glance, to be a crack in the wall behind Biden. This crack, however, simply shows a partially opened door.\nThe Oval Office has four doors, two of which were designed to blend in with the walls. Here's a photograph of Trump that shows the same \"crack\" that can be seen in the viral image of Biden. In the Trump photo, it's clear that this \"crack\" is just a door:\nWhile these \"hidden\" doors may conjure up thoughts of secret passages or escape pathways, there isn't anything secret about these doors. They are just normal doors that open up to rooms adjacent to the Oval Office. The decision to blend them into the walls appears to have been a purely aesthetic choice.\nHere's another video from the Oval Office that showcases these doors. In 2010, former President Barack Obama met with some students featured in the documentary \"Waiting for Superman.\" At one point, one of the kids asks Obama about these strange looking doors:",

However, if you doled out $500 million equally among 327 million people, they would not each receive $1 million.

He could have given each American $1 million and still have money left over. I feel like a $1 million check would be life-changing for most people. Yet he wasted it all on ads and STILL LOST.\"\nWilliams read from the tweet after it was introduced by Mara Gay, a member of the New York Times editorial board, who said that \"somebody tweeted recently that actually, with the money (Bloomberg) spent, he couldve given every American a million dollars.\"\n\"Its an incredible way of putting it,\" Williams said after displaying the tweet on screen.\nIf that sounds too good to be true, its because it is. A quick use of a calculator shows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person.\nThats enough to buy a pack of gum or a Kit Kat bar at CVS, but its not breaking the bank.\nWilliams quickly corrected the error on air, and the Twitter account for his TV show issued a correction and apology in a tweet posted hours after the show finished.\n\"Turns out Mara and I got the same grades at math,\" Williams said after a commercial break. \"Im speaking of the tweet we both misinterpreted. He could give each American a dollar.\"\n\"The tweet is wrong,\" he said.\nGay also tweeted about the incident, saying she was \"buying a calculator, brb.\"\nAs for the author of the original tweet, she switched her Twitter account settings to private but wrote in her bio, \"I know, Im bad at math.\"\nBloomberg did spend in the ballpark of $500 million on ads and other campaign-related finances, according to reports. And the census estimates that the U.S. population is a little more than 327 million people.\nBut even at roughly $500 million, the billionaire didnt spend nearly the amount of money he would've needed to give every American $1 million. Thats bad math.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!",

On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall? Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isnt playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials emphatic insistence that theyll never cough up the dough.\nBecause nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that, the billionaire businessman added. We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. Thats how I know theyre bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, Im going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when Im done building it, Im going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteens Born In The USA to them, just for the hell of it. You just dont mess with the U.S., and thats that ... Let me tell you, weve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think thats a pretty definitive message, and thats the hard way. Now, Ive said before that political correctness is whats killing this country, and Im standing by it. However, since Ive never been a warmonger, Im trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, well have no problem. If they dont and they start acting up, well, well just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.\nComments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from an MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:\nOn MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\nTrust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn't playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday.\nOne of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials' emphatic insistence that they'll never cough up the dough.\nMexican President Pea Nieto blasted Trump in two separate interviews this week, slamming the billionaire's strident expressions to a Mexico City newspaper and warning that the kind of rhetoric he uses has led to very fateful scenes in the history of humanity.\nThat's the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived, Pea Nieto said. Trump's comments, he told El Universal, have \"hurt the relationship we have sought with the United States.\"\nThe first portion of the article may have led readers to think that the subsequent claims were real, but everything beyond its first paragraph was fabricated. Content published by the self-styled \"hybrid\" news sites Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo built upon controversial current events with related embellishments. Politicalo and related sites featured a button enabling readers to \"Show Facts\" or \"Hide Facts\":\nHowever, every Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo item opened in \"Hide Facts\" mode by default, making the embellishments difficult for readers to identify. In addition to its \"Show Facts/Hide Facts\" feature, Politicalo's disclaimer explained:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nPrevious Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo articles that caused social media confusion included claims that Marco Rubio said women should be taken into custody if they were considering an abortion (and that Zika was a punishment from God), Pat Robertson said gay people should wear colors by which heterosexual people could identify them in public, Pastor John Piper said bikini waxes were a sin in the eyes of God, David Bowie was alive but held hostage by Satanic entities, Ted Cruz said God would not have allowed Antonin Scalia to die at a time that was not politically expedient, a Republican lawmaker proposed saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for food stamp recipients, and Bristol Palin said that more black actors weren't nominated for Oscars because they all looked alike.",

During Winfrey's bombshell interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, on March 7, 2021, some took to social media to report they believed they saw evidence that Winfrey was wearing one. Here's an example of one such post, with the user's name cropped out for privacy:\nAs we have previously reported, QAnon followers generally believe that various Democratic legislators and A-list celebrities are part of a satanic, cannibalistic pedophile ring:\nIn general, QAnon believes [former U.S. President Donald] Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a deep state, satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions pizza, and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light on the president. Proponents of this theory believe that one day soon the storm will come and Trump, with the help of an anonymous high-ranking military official known as Q, will round up members of the deep state, arrest them, and possibly have them executed.\nThe latter part of the above paragraph explains why QAnon followers believe so many famous people wear ankle monitors. The belief system prompts them to look for signs that those famous people are on the brink of mass arrest, as they wait, and wait, for the so-called \"storm\" of arrests and prosecutions to come.\nBut Winfrey wasn't wearing an ankle monitor, nor is she being GPS-tracked by a fictional \"Q\" character and a former president. She was wearing long, brown leather boots, and the bump that people saw was simply a crease in the material when she sat with her legs crossed.",

It was set up by demonstrators amid protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose in-custody death while pinned under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020 went viral after being captured on video.\nDuring the resulting weeks of sustained protests against racism and police brutality, Seattle activists set up the police-free zone, which has become a target for criticism by President Donald Trump and his supporters. But disparaging comments linking the performer to the CHOP are misleading, as the image has nothing to do with the protests.\nHere is the version of the photograph that is being shared, along with commentary such as, \"Antifa Seattle today  this is the group that the Democrats want to rule America  no further comment necessary?!\"\nBut the picture wasn't taken in Seattle, and it wasn't taken during the protests that swept the nation in the spring of 2020 in the wake of Floyd's killing.\nThe original photograph was taken by photographer Peretz Partensky on Sept. 25, 2011, at the Folsom Street Fair, which is a leather and BDSM festival that takes place every fall in San Francisco, California. And the singer in the black netting is a member of the Italian disco band Hard Ton, which is based in Venice, Italy, according to its Facebook profile. The antifa flag in the upper left corner was edited into the picture after the fact.\nWe contacted Hard Ton for comment about the picture being misappropriated, but did not hear back in time for publication.\nBecause the original photograph was taken long before the CHOP was set up in Seattle, and the events took place in a different location altogether, we rate this claim \"Miscaptioned.\"",

These dangerous foreign walk-overs who look more and more like real every-day normal Americans, lured with gift baskets and teddy bears, often blend into the very footholds of our societal norms after establishing dangerous toeholds.\nPalin, known as a vocal and athletic supporter of Donald Trump, said that she is now a double-barreled, locked and loaded supporter of both Trumps and Ted Cruzs proposed guidelines for stricter immigration laws, border protections and neighborhood scrutinies.\n-An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Mrs. Palins call for the removal of Aerobics from physical education courses. The author regrets the error.\nThere is no truth to this story, which came from a well-known (and prolific) hoax and satire news site. The joke in this case is that \"Arabic numerals\" (also known as Hindu-Arabic numerals) are the numbers most familiar to much of the world, and originated in India during the 6th or 7th century. They were introduced to Europe by mathematicians from what is now the Middle East (shown here as they appeared in the Codex Vigilianus around the 10th century):\nPalin has thrown her political backing behind Trump, and has been active on traditional and social media expressing that support. However, she has made no mention of banning numbers, whether of Hindu-Arabic or Roman origin.",

But claims on social media that she broke up his marriage misrepresent the facts. Brown had separated from his wife years before he and Harris had dated.\nFull Story\nFalse and misleading claims targeting Vice President Kamala Harris intensified as she drew closer to formally becoming the Democratic nominee for president on Aug. 5.\nWeve written about the false narrative that Harris only recently began identifying as Black.\nAnother viral claim circulating on social media rehashes old rumors about Harris relationship with the influential California Democrat Willie Brown in the 1990s while Harris was working as an assistant district attorney. These posts misleadingly claimed that Harris started her career by sleeping with a married man or that she stole a black womans husband.\nHere is what we know about Harris relationship with Brown.\nHarris was 29 in March 1994 when a San Francisco Chronicle columnist described her as Browns new steady, going on to say that she was something new in Willies love life. Shes a woman, not a girl. At the time, Brown, who was then 60 years old and speaker of the California State Assembly, had been estranged from his wife for more than a decade.\nAs speaker, Brown appointed Harris to the California Medical Assistance Commission later that year, which provides the basis for claims that Brown helped Harris career that sometimes accompany the claims suggesting that she broke up his marriage. (Brown left the Assembly in 1995, and became mayor of San Francisco until 2004.)\nBrown had married Blanche Vitero in 1957 and the couple had three children. But by the early 1970s, Brown was frequently seen around town with young women and his marriage collapsed, according to a 1996 biography written by James Richardson, a senior writer at the Sacramento Bee. It was at this time that Brown got the first of a series of apartments of his own, while his relationship with his wife settled into a mutually beneficial friendship, Richardson wrote.\nA 1984 profile published in the New York Times described Brown as an escort for attractive women and good friend of his former wife, from whom it says he separated amicably two years earlier.\nI dont know whether the marriage failed and the relationship survived or vice versa, but something very valuable lasted, Brown wrote in his own 2008 autobiography, explaining that he and his wife had celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2007, although they hadnt lived together in 25 years.\nAlthough Blanche and I led very different lives, there was never a breakup, he wrote. The two of us kept the family circle going. Weve always been in each others lives. Were friends.\nIndeed, as we said, Brown had developed a reputation for dating around and, in 2001, he welcomed a fourth child, a daughter, with his then-girlfriend Carolyn Carpeneti.\nHarris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship by the end of 1995 or the beginning of 1996. But it has come up repeatedly since Harris first sought public office as San Francisco district attorney, which she won in 2003. During that campaign, Harris was trying to distance herself from Brown, telling SF Weekly, His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing. She called him an albatross hanging around my neck.\nBut, 20 years later, claims about that relationship continue to shadow Harris as she seeks higher office.\nClarification, Aug. 8: We updated this story to better reflect the time frame for when Harris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nVice presidential nominee Kamala Harris had an extramarital affair with former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who gave her two political appointments that launched her political career.\nRating:\nMixture\nAbout this rating\nWhat's True\nHarris did date former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown for a period of time between 1994 to 1995. In his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed her to two political posts  first to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and then to the Medical Assistance Commission.\nWhat's False\nAlthough Brown was technically still married during the time period that he dated Harris, he had been estranged from his wife Blanche Brown for more than a decade. Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened well after the relationship ended, and Harris sought to distance herself from Brown.\nOn Aug. 11, 2020, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, selected U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate. Harris, who is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, made history as the first woman of color nominated as vice president on a major party ticket.\nPredictably, the internet lit up with rumors about Harris, who has been married to her husband, attorney Douglas Emhoff, since 2014. Snopes readers asked about articles and memes circulating on social media stating that years prior, Harris had an \"extramarital\" affair with former San Francisco Mayor and California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, with some claiming that Harris' political success was achieved by being Brown's so-called mistress.\nA tawdry headline from Teaparty.org story read, \"Flashback: Kamala Harris Launched Her Political Career In Bedroom As Mistress Of Married Mayor Willie Brown.\"\nHere's an example of a meme circulating on Facebook, which appears to have been generated during Harris' run in the presidential primaries:\nThese narratives are misleading by way of exaggeration. Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, but Brown had been estranged from his wife since 1981. Brown did appoint Harris to two political posts in 1994 while he served as Speaker of the California Assembly, but that was years before Harris won her first election in 2003. She was already working as an assistant district attorney in Alameda County when she took on the appointments.\nIt's never been a secret Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, although it may not be well known outside political circles in California. Brown addressed their past relationship in a terse piece published by the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 26, 2019, a day before Harris officially launched her presidential campaign:\nYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker.\nAnd I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.\nThe history of the relationship and political appointments Brown gave Harris have also been reported in California-based news outlets for years. Los Angeles Magazine reported in 2019:\nWillie Brown was a fixture in California politics for years, serving as speaker of the state assembly for 15 years, and known as something of an unofficial deal-maker and influencer. He first met Harris in 1994, when she was an assistant district attorney in Alameda County. He was 60 years old at the time, and had been estranged from his wife, Blanche Brown, since 1981.\nIn his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed Harris to two political positions. The first was a six-month appointment to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board; the second was a role on the Medical Assistance Commission, a body tasked with negotiating contracts to control Medi-Cal costs. At the time, Brown had a reputation for filling many openings with his personal associates and inner circle; when Harris vacated the Appeals Board gig, he replaced her with his longtime buddy Philip S. Ryan.\nHarris ended the relationshipwhich was conducted in the open and frequently reported on at the timein late 1995, shortly before Brown was sworn in for his first of two terms as mayor of San Francisco.\nHarris didn't run for political office until well after her relationship with Brown ended. In 2003, she made a successful bid for the office of San Francisco district attorney, a position she held until she was elected to serve as the attorney general of California, taking office in 2011. She held that post until she was elected in 2016 to serve in the United States Senate representing the state of California.\nHarris has been beset by allegations that Brown influenced her career for years. At the time of her first run for office for San Francisco district attorney, SF Weekly quoted Harris distancing herself from Brown:\nI refuse to design my campaign around criticizing Willie Brown for the sake of appearing to be independent when I have no doubt that I am independent of him  and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\nHis career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\nIn regards to the political appointments, Harris went on to state:\nThese jobs were created before I was born. Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work. I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital [in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood] open. I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs. I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no\nIt's true that Harris dated Brown between 1994 and 1995. During that time, when he was serving as speaker of the California assembly, Brown gave Harris two political appointments. Although it's true that Brown was married at that time, the relationship was no secret, since Brown had long been separated from his wife. All of Harris' electoral victories occurred years after her relationship with Brown ended. We rate this claim \"Mixture,\" because while there are elements of objective fact  Brown and Harris dated, Brown appointed Harris to two posts  other elements are sensationalized and misleading.",

As the state assembly speaker, Brown appointed her to two political posts: the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and later the Medical Assistance Commission.\nWhat's False\nWhile Brown was still married when he and Harris started to date, he and his wife, Blanche Brown, had been separated 13 years by then. Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened eight years after the relationship ended. Since then, Harris and Brown have taken several opportunities to distance themselves from each other.\nAfter U.S. President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, ended his 2024 campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in July 2024, old rumors that she had \"slept her way to the top\" returned:\nThe claim spread quickly on X, Facebook and TikTok.\nSeveral people, including former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, insisted that Harris' affair to former San Francisco Mayor and Speaker of the California Assembly Willie Brown was relevant to her White House bid as proof of her \"ruthlessness\" and \"ambition.\" Indeed, they said, Brown gave her visibility by appointing her to two political posts in the mid-1990s, when they were reportedly \"dating.\"\nThe claim first appeared in 2020, after Biden nominated Harris as his running mate. At the time, a headline from Teaparty.org story read, \"Flashback: Kamala Harris Launched Her Political Career In Bedroom As Mistress Of Married Mayor Willie Brown.\"\nMemes generated during the 2020 Democratic primaries also shared the claim:\nThe rumors were misleading as they exaggerated both the adulterous aspect of the relationship and the importance of Brown's influence on Harris' career.\nThen 29, Harris dated Brown in 1994 and 1995, but Brown, who was 60 when their relationship began, had been separated from his wife, Blanche Brown, since 1981. Harris was assistant district attorney in Alameda County when they met. Brown then appointed Harris to two political posts while he was speaker of the California Assembly, but that was in 1994  years before Harris was elected district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. She would remain in that post until 2011, when she won the office of California district attorney. In 2016, she ran for U.S. Senate and was elected.\nNeither Brown nor Harris ever tried to conceal the fact they had been a couple . Brown addressed accusations of favoritism in the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 26, 2019 :\nYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker.\nAnd I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.\nHarris announced she was running in the 2020 presidential election the next day.\nThe story was also well-known in California media. In 2019, Los Angeles Magazine published:\nWillie Brown was a fixture in California politics for years, serving as speaker of the state assembly for 15 years, and known as something of an unofficial deal-maker and influencer. He first met Harris in 1994, when she was an assistant district attorney in Alameda County.\n\nIn his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed Harris to two political positions. The first was a six-month appointment to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board; the second was a role on the Medical Assistance Commission, a body tasked with negotiating contracts to control Medi-Cal costs. At the time, Brown had a reputation for filling many openings with his personal associates and inner circle; when Harris vacated the Appeals Board gig, he replaced her with his longtime buddy Philip S. Ryan.\nHarris ended the relationship  which was conducted in the open and frequently reported on at the time  in late 1995, shortly before Brown was sworn in for his first of two terms as mayor of San Francisco.\nFor years, Harris fought allegations that Brown had boosted her political career. When she was a candidate to San Francisco district attorney, she told SF Weekly she had long stopped needing Brown's support:\nI refuse to design my campaign around criticizing Willie Brown for the sake of appearing to be independent when I have no doubt that I am independent of him  and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\nHis career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\nShe added, regarding the positions Brown had appointed her to:\nThese jobs were created before I was born. Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work. I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital [in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood] open. I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs. I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no?\nWe deemed this rumor a \"Mixture,\" because while it included some truth  Brown and Harris dated, Brown appointed Harris to two posts  the relationship was not actually adulterous and Brown's influence on Harris' career was exaggerated.\nWe addressed this claim when it first made the rounds in 2020.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA San Francisco mural portrait of Greta Thunberg used 700 gallons of spray paint.\nIn November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about widely shared social media posts claiming irony or hypocrisy at work in the production of a massive San Francisco mural in honor of the young climate activist Greta Thunberg.\nOn Nov. 8, the right-leaning social media activist Brandon Straka tweeted a link to a KPIX-TV article about the mural, adding his own view that, \"The leftist geniuses in San Francisco have decided to send a message about climate change by creating a 6 story [sic] mural of Greta Thunberg using 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\"\nThe text of Straka's tweet, and screenshots of it, were further promulgated by multiple users on Facebook. The KPIX-TV article to which he linked did not contain any reference to the paint used by Argentinian artist Andrs Pereoselli (known as \"Cobre\") in creating the Thunberg mural. As such, it did not provide any evidence to support Straka's key claim, that the portrait of the climate activist required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\nIt's not clear where that figure came from, but it might have originated in an article on the right-leaning website The Blaze, which wrote:\n\"While it is unclear how many spray cans [Cobre] has used, the mural spans four stories and at least one smaller project utilized 500 cans of the paint scientists say can generate asthma-inducing smog.\"\nThe Daily Wire, another right-leaning website, subsequently extrapolated that \"the Thunberg mural will likely take closer to 700 cans to finish.\"\nAnalysis\nIn response to concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint, One Atmosphere, a California environmental non-profit group that collaborated with Cobre on the mural, posted the following explanation to Instagram on Nov. 11:\nSome folks have been asking about the environmental impacts of the Greta mural. Read on for some details. The vast majority of the paint is water-based acrylic exterior paint that was rolled onto the building by hand. The finishing details can only be done with spray paint, but we are using spray cans without CFCs. (CFCs are tremendously damaging to the environment). We are using low pressure cans with a minimal footprint. The cans and the boxes will also be recycled, although many of the cans will first have a second life as part of a separate art project.\nThe cans have been picked up and delivered in an electric vehicle, and the artist and organizers have been travelling almost exclusively by way of electric car, electric scooter or on foot to the project site. The lift being used is also electric, not diesel. We are doing our best to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in that order!\nAfter the completion of the project, One Atmosphere's Executive Director Paul Scott provided further details to Snopes in an email. He firmly rejected the claim that the project required 700 gallons, or even 700 cans, of spray paint.\nIn reality, Scott said he counted a total of 117 used 400-ml cans of spray paint, almost all of them from the MTN 94 brand. That's just over 12 gallons in total. However, only some of that 400-ml capacity is taken up by the hydrocarbon propellant that escapes into the atmosphere (as opposed to the liquid paint, which ends up on the side of the building).\nAll aerosol spray paints use a propellant to help disperse the paint from the can and onto its intended surface. In the past, manufacturers used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals that were widely banned from the late 1980s onwards due to the fact that they deplete the ozone layers in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.\nIn the United States in 2019, spray paint manufacturers use hydrocarbons such as propane and butane as propellants. Unlike CFCs, hydrocarbons don't have a deleterious effect on ozone, but they do have a small effect on global warming. However, it's worth putting the scale of that effect into some context, using a measure known as Global Warming Potential.\nAs the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains on its website:\n\"The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period.\"\nThe CFCs used as propellants in aerosol paint in the past have a GWP of between 5,000 and 14,000. Propane, a hydrocarbon commonly used now as a propellant in spray paint, has a GWP of 4. In his email to Snopes, Scott added that, \"The amount of the propellant is also less because the cans are lower pressure, and obviously only a portion of each can is propellant, so the ultimate GWP impact of the cans we used is very limited.\"",

        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people have marched through the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to protest against President Nicolas Maduro.\nOpposition supporters, staging their largest rally for two years, called for Mr Maduro's removal.\nThey blame him for Venezuela's economic crisis and accuse the electoral commission of delaying a referendum that could shorten his stay in power.\nMr Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers.\nHe accuses the opposition of trying to stage a coup.\nThe opposition said close to a million people turned out for their march, dubbed the \"Takeover of Caracas\", but the government disputed the figures.\n\"We have shown to the world the importance of Venezuela and how much it wants change,\" said opposition politician Jesus Torrealba.\nDressed predominantly in white, they chanted \"we are going to bring down Maduro\".\nProtesters said they had enough of the policies of the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela.\n\"We are going to defeat hunger, crime, inflation and corruption. They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,\" Naty Gutierrez told Reuters news agency.\nA small group of protesters clashed with riot police as the peaceful rally ended.\n\"The nation has triumphed. They wanted to intimidate the people but the people are here,\" said Mr Maduro at a rally in central Caracas he said was attended by 30,000 people.\n\"We have defeated an attempted coup that tried to fill Venezuela and Caracas with violence, death,\" he said.\nThe opposition hopes the march will pressure the electoral authorities into allowing them to launch the second petition needed to trigger the recall referendum as soon as possible.\nTiming is key as the date when the referendum is held will determine what happens next.\nIf a referendum should go against the president before 10 January, new elections will be held, which the opposition hopes to win.\nBut if it is held after that date and Mr Maduro is recalled, his loyal vice-president will serve out the end of his term until 2019.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

        "title": "US officials: Pilot error caused Kobe Bryant chopper crash",
        "date": "2021-02-09T23:20:51",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP)  The pilot who crashed the helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant, killing all nine aboard, made a series of poor decisions that led him to fly blindly into a wall of clouds where he became so disoriented he thought he was climbing when the craft was plunging toward a Southern California hillside, federal safety officials said Tuesday.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board primarily blamed pilot Ara Zobayan in the Jan. 26, 2020 crash that killed him along with Bryant, the basketball stars daughter and six other passengers heading to a girls basketball tournament.\nZobayan, an experienced pilot, ignored his training, violated flight rules by flying into conditions where he couldnt see and failed to take alternate measures, such as slowing down and landing or switching to auto-pilot, that would have averted the tragedy.\nThe NTSB said it was likely Zobayan felt pressure to deliver his star client to his daughters game at Bryants Mamba Sports Academy. Officials believe Zobayan may have also felt continuation bias, an unconscious tendency among pilots to stick with the original plan despite changing conditions.\nThe closer you get to the destination the more you think just maybe you can pull this off, NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said Tuesday.\nThe agency announced the long-awaited findings during a four-hour hearing pinpointing probable causes of what went awry in the 40-minute flight. The crash led to widespread public mourning for the retired basketball star and several lawsuits, and prompted state and federal legislation.\nThe agency also faulted Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, for inadequate review and oversight of safety matters.\nWhen Zobayan decided to climb above the clouds, he entered a trap that has doomed many flights. Once a pilot loses visual cues by flying into fog or darkness, the inner ear can send erroneous signals to the brain that causes spatial disorientation. Its sometimes known as the leans, causing pilots to believe they are flying aircraft straight and level when they are banking.\nZobayan radioed air traffic controllers that he was climbing when, in fact, he was banking and descending rapidly toward the steep hills near Calabasas, NTSB investigators concluded.\nFlying under visual flight rules, Zobayan was required to be able to see where he was going. Flying into the cloud was a violation of that standard and probably led to his disorientation, NTSB said.\nThere were 184 aircraft crashes between 2010-2019 involving spatial disorientation, including 20 fatal helicopter crashes, the NTSB said.\nWhat part of cloud, when youre on a visual flight rules program, do pilots not understand? Landsberg said.\nNTSB member Michael Graham said Zobayan ignored his training and added that that as long as helicopter pilots continue flying into clouds without relying on instruments, which requires a high level of training, a certain percentage arent going to come out alive.\nZobayan had been certified to fly using only instruments, but was no longer proficient, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.\nThe Sikorsky S-76B helicopter was flying at about 184 mph (296 kph) and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) per minute when it slammed into the hillside and ignited, scattering debris over an area the size of a football field. The victims died immediately.\nBryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and six others who left Orange County that morning were headed to his Mamba Sports Academy in Ventura County. The group had flown to the same destination the previous day and Zobayan had flown Bryant along that route at least 10 times in 2019.\nThe aircraft itself had been flown on largely direct routes between the airports in Orange and Ventura counties about two dozen times since late 2018, data shows, but the pilot took the chopper further north because of low visibility that day.\nThere was no sign of mechanical failure and the pilot was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, investigators said.\nThe helicopter did not have so-called black box recording devices, which were not required, that would have given investigators a better understanding of what happened.\nThe NTSB report reiterated a previous recommendation to require flight data and cockpit voice recorders on choppers, but the agency only investigates transportation-related crashes. It has no enforcement powers and must submit suggestions to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration or the Coast Guard, which have repeatedly rejected some board safety recommendations after other transportation disasters.\nOver the past year, experts speculated that the crash could lead to a recommendation for requiring helicopters to have Terrain Awareness and Warning System devices, which signal when aircraft are in danger of crashing.\nBut NTSB investigator-in-charge Bill English said the system, which was not on the helicopter, would probably not have prevented the crash.\nThe hilly terrain, combined with the disorientation, would have made the warning system a confusing factor, English said.\nThe pilot doesnt know which way is up, English said.\nFederal lawmakers have sponsored the Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant Helicopter Safety Act to mandate the warning systems on all helicopters carrying six or more passengers.\nThe NTSB report is likely to factor into litigation in the case, whether its admissible in court or not, said Dallas lawyer Michael Lyons.\nThe crash generated lawsuits and countersuits, with Bryants widow suing Island Express and the pilot for wrongful death on the day a massive public memorial was held almost a year ago at Staples Center, where the Lakers all-star played most his career.\nVanessa Bryant said Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, and its owner, Island Express Holding Corp., did not properly train or supervise Zobayan. She said the pilot was careless and negligent to fly in fog and should have aborted the flight.\nZobayans brother, Berge Zobayan, has said Kobe Bryant knew the risks of flying in a helicopter and that his survivors arent entitled to damages from the pilots estate. Island Express Helicopters Inc. denied responsibility and said the crash was an act of God that it could not control.\nLawyers for Berge Zobayan and Island Express said they had no comment on the NTSB findings.\nFamilies of other victims sued the helicopter companies but not the pilot.\nThe others killed in the crash were Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughters basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton. Alyssa and Payton were Giannas teammates.\nThe companies have countersued two FAA air traffic controllers, saying the crash was caused by their series of erroneous acts and/or omissions.\nWhile air traffic controllers failed to report the loss of radar contact and radar communication with the flight, which was inconsistent with their procedures, it did not contribute to the crash, the NTSB said.",

        "content": "Claim:\nHillary Clinton was \"'on trial' for Benghazi\" in June 2020, but the news of it was obscured by other events.\nIn June 2020, as protests ignited by the police-custody death of George Floyd swept across the U.S., a widely shared social media meme asserted that former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been \"'on trial' for Benghazi,\" but the news of that occurrence had been obscured by news media coverage of the Floyd protests:\nBut in fact, no legal activity -- either in the court system or in Congress -- involving Clinton and the 2012 attack against two United States government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, was taking place in June 2020.\nThis meme likely confusingly referenced a court hearing that took place on June 2 to determine whether Clinton should be compelled to submit to a deposition in a lawsuit. However, that lawsuit was about a records request and compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) related to Clinton's use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state -- it had nothing to do with the 2012 attack in Benghazi, was not a \"trial,\" and did not involve any appearance by Clinton herself in court.\nA House Select Committee extensively investigated the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead in Libya and issued a lengthy report that found no wrongdoing on the part of Clinton in connection with that event:\nEnding one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead.\nThe 800-page report delivered a broad rebuke of the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department  and the officials who led them  for failing to grasp the acute security risks in Benghazi, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect.\nPrevious investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation. But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun.",

        "content": "Claim:\nChinese officials are seeking approval to start the mass killing of 20,000 people in order to stop the spread of new coronavirus.\nOn Feb. 5, 2020, the website AB-TC (aka City News) published an article that claimed Chinese officials were seeking approval from the Supreme Peoples Court to start the mass killing of 20,000 people infected with the new coronavirus in an attempt to contain the disease:\nChina seek for courts approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus\nThe highest level of court in Chhina [sic], Supreme Peoples Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.\nThe State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.\nThis is not a genuine news report. While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet's reporting.\nFor starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \"BREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\" But Shurmur didn't die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.\nThe website has also published hoax articles about \"cannibal restaurants\" (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\nThis website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:\nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News' website\nOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called City News published an article titled BREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\nAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\nNone of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person's byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called \"local correspondents.\"\nIn other words, this website doesn't exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting.\nIn addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC's article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \"document\" or a \"press conference,\" they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \"the state\" or \"the court\" or an \"official\" made a statement, but doesn't provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\nLastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China \"ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.\" That report, of course, made no mention of \"mass killings.\"\nThere is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China website.\nAB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we've concluded that this report is indeed false.",

At 81, he's the oldest president in U.S. history.\nBut some things apparently never get old, notably the strange tradition of presidential turkey pardons, which is happening again Monday as well.\n\"This is the 76th anniversary of this event, and I want you to know, I wasn't there for the first one,\" Biden said with a chuckle right before he spared \"Liberty\" and \"Bell,\" this year's turkeys from a flock in Minnesota.\nThe tradition of giving presidents turkeys to eat did, in fact, start in 1947, but of pardoning them, that's a more complicated tale.\nThis has come to be a tradition that ironically features an American president sanctioning an event sponsored by a lobbying group, which advocates the opposite of what actually takes place at said event.\nThe president makes a few jokes and lets a turkey go free in what only became a formalized occurrence at the White House in the 1980s. But the turkey lobby's actual goal, as most likely know, is to get people to eat more turkey.\nA long, strange history\nThis dance between the turkey lobby and presidents started in the 1940s, but back then, it was  a more honest  gifting of a bird for the president and his family to eat at Thanksgiving.\nBut death is a hard sell.\nMost Americans probably don't know or think about how their food gets to their tables. They really care, as surveys have found, about how it tastes and how cheap it is.\nPoliticians know this.\nRealizing the awkwardness of the whole situation  of publicly accepting a live turkey that was destined for his dinner table  John F. Kennedy broke the tradition in 1963.\n\"I think we'll just let this one grow,\" Kennedy said of the gobbling fowl with a sign around its neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"\nHe and succeeding presidents would realize, it's better to be seen as a turkey liberator rather than the one to publicly send ol' Giblet to the executioner.\nThere was a close call, though, during the George W. Bush administration when Barney, the president's plucky Scottish Terrier, almost silenced the gobble of that year's bird.\nIt took Bush hustling out of a national security meeting to call him off. And remember, this is the same dog that bit a reporter.\nGood thing Biden's German Shepherds were kept far away from the event or there might have been a real ... fowl up.\nAn expanding tradition ... for some reason\nThe birds get their royal treatment, their own hotel room and, of course, punny jokes. And despite the irony, pointed out by your author year after year, this event shows no signs of slowing down.\nIn fact, it only seems to be expanding.\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer brought the tradition to Michigan in 2022, pardoning \"Mitch E. Gander\" (get it!?). And it's slated to happen again this year.\nAlabama has apparently been doing this for decades. Oddly, the birds also, according to the Alabama Daily News, used to use the same names for the turkey every year for some reason  \"Clyde\" and \"Henrietta.\"\nThat changed this year after an online poll of Alabamians picked Giblet and Puddin'.\n\"Today, by the powers vested in me as governor of the state of Alabama,\" Gov. Kay Ivey said at this year's event, \"I hereby am granting a full pardon to Giblet and Puddin', so that they can spend their turkey day enjoying a meal of their own.\"\nLet's just hope that meal isn't what everyone else eats for Thanksgiving.\nIt's become so embedded in the culture that a town in East Texas this year decided to join in on the strange tradition and let live a turkey by the name of ... Dolly Pardon.\n\"The turkey is named Dolly because she's a strong female role model,\" Lisa Mays-Gonzalez, Van Community Library director. \"And it's a tribute to our Southern roots. And she is a very strong literacy advocate.\"\nNo word on whether the turkey can read.\nDolly is set to live out her days at the \"Believe in Vegan\" ranch.",

Individual farms had been gifting presidents birds since the 19th century.\nHis government launched a campaign in 1947 to encourage people to forego eating poultry and eggs on Thursdays, in order to conserve supplies to send to post-war Europe. But Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day fell on Thursdays that year causing outrage.\nPoultry growers sent crates of live chickens to the White House as part of a \"Hens for Harry\" protest campaign.\nOther presidents before Mr Bush Snr did spare birds lives, including President John F Kennedy - who gave an unofficial pardoning days before his assassination in 1963. The light-hearted event with media presence would set the tone for today's presentations.\nPresidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan were also reported to have spared some gifted turkey's lives by sending them to live on farms.\nUnder President Barack Obama, the event became an opportunity for his daughters to make rare public appearances. There has been speculation as to whether 11-year-old Barron Trump will appear at Tuesday's event.\nMr Obama became known for his \"dad jokes\" at the pardonings, in 2016 invoking questionable turkey puns like \"Yes we cran!\".\nThis year's birds, Wishbone and Drumstick, are currently staying at the Willard Intercontinental hotel, where all White House birds have stayed since 2004.\nVideos of them messing up their beds with sawdust were posted by the White House social media team.\nTheir luxury hotel stay is financed by the National Turkey Association, which continues to donate birds each year. This year's birds were raised in Alexandria, Minnesota, by the group's chairman.\nTurkey is the favourite US food for the Thanksgiving holiday, with an estimated 46 million consumed on the day annually.\nTop-Trump turkey stats\nThe Trump administration released statistic cards for both birds online alongside a poll to see which the public thought should be officially pardoned.\nThe poll spurned some users on social media to make jokes about whether he should use his pardoning on members of his administration, because of the ongoing Russian collusion investigation.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

        "content": "A lame-duck president \"pardoned\" a turkey Monday.\n\"They tell me there's 2,500 people here today looking for a pardon,\" President Biden joked at a White House ceremony on the South Lawn. After one of the turkeys, Peach, let out a few gobbles, Biden said, \"What did you say, Peach? Peach is making a last-minute plea here.\"\nHe implored the turkeys to \"keep calm and gobble on,\" then pardoned them. \"Based on your temperament and your commitment to being productive members of society,\" the president said, \"I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom.\"\nBiden noted that the birds would live out their days at the Farmamerica Agricultural Interpretive Center in Minnesota, the top-producing turkey state.\nHe hinted to this strange event's history and did so accurately, unlike many past presidents.\nNot to be snood-y about it, but this fowl tradition has a long and oft-confused history. So let's dispel the myths that get stuck in our beaks that too many have clawed onto and get to the truth of the matter.\nEven presidents have gotten it wrong\nWhich president was the first to pardon a turkey? This might be a shaggy turkey story, but bear with us.\nTo paraphrase a former president, this depends on what the definition of \"pardon\" is.\n\"This is a tradition that dates back to the presidency of Harry Truman,\" then-President George W. Bush said in 2008.\nEh. Sort of, but not when it comes to pardoning turkeys.\n\"So continuing a tradition begun 50 years ago by President Truman, I am going to keep at least -- excuse me -- one turkey off of the Thanksgiving dinner table by giving a pardon to a turkey from Ohio,\" said former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\nThat's definitely not true. And he repeated it the next year.\n\"President Truman was the first president to pardon a turkey,\" he said.\nStill not true. It got so bad that the Truman Library had to weigh in.\n\"The Library's staff has found no documents, speeches, newspaper clippings, photographs, or other contemporary records in our holdings which refer to Truman pardoning a turkey that he received as a gift in 1947, or at any other time during his Presidency,\" it said in a statement in 2003. \"Truman sometimes indicated to reporters that the turkeys he received were destined for the family dinner table.\"\nTruman was the first to be given a turkey by the National Turkey Federation, but not the first to pardon one\nThis is where the confusion comes in. The turkey lobby has been presenting presidents with turkeys since 1947, when Truman was president.\nBut, as the Truman Library notes, the post-Depression, post-World War II-era president ate his turkeys.\nAnd that was the original intent  a gift for the presidential holiday table and for Big Turkey to get attention and remind people to eat turkey for Thanksgiving, of course.\nThere's a story that suggests Abraham Lincoln was the first to let a turkey go because his son took a liking to it, but the White House Historical Association says that story is \"likely apocryphal.\"\nSo maybe it was Lincoln, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was Kennedy?\nThe first documented reprieve of a turkey during a turkey presentation from the Turkey Federation was in 1963.\nA sign hung around a turkey's neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"\nSo clearly the intent was for the president to eat it. But Kennedy, for whatever reason, said, \"We'll just let this one grow.\"\nThe L.A. Times headlined that 1963 event as a \"presidential pardon.\"\nBut it certainly wasn't official.\nWhen was the word \"pardon\" first used by a president in relation to a turkey?\nFollowing Kennedy, Nixon and Carter sent their turkeys to petting zoos. But the word \"pardon\" wasn't used until Reagan in 1987, when he presented that year's White House turkey, \"Charlie.\"\nIt was during the Iran-Contra crisis, and ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson yelled a question about whether Reagan would pardon Oliver North and John Poindexter, who were involved in the arms swap. Reagan deflected, saying, \"If they'd given me a different answer on Charlie and his future, I would have pardoned him.\"\nThe turkey pardon became an officially sanctioned White House event by George H.W. Bush\nThe elder former President Bush, Reagan's vice president, formalized the event in 1989.\n\"[L]et me assure you and this fine tom turkey,\" he said, \"that he will not end up on anyone's dinner table, not this guy  he's presented a presidential pardon as of right nowand allow him to live out his days on a children's farm not far from here.\"",

        "content": "It was not his first presidential pardon and, the way things are going, it wont be his last.\nWatched by wife Melania, son Barron and daughters Ivanka and Tiffany, Donald Trump used his powers of leniency on Tuesday to spare a pair of turkeys from the Thanksgiving roaster.\nWow, big bird! Trump said as he approached a turkey named Drumstick in the White House rose garden. How heavy is that bird? Wow, 36 pounds. That is a big bird.\nNot always cautious about asking before grabbing, the president queried if he was allowed to touch the birds feathers and, told yes, proceeded to stroke its feathers. I feel so good about myself doing this, he said, mysteriously. Are you ready, Drumstick? OK? Drumstick, you are hereby pardoned!\nBut twice a young reporter rose from his seat at the back of the audience and shouted: Are you going to pardon any people?! Trump ignored what was presumably a reference to special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into contacts between his campaign  including son Donald Jr, son-in-law Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn  with Russia during last years presidential election.\nIndeed, the president has already shown he will not hesitate to use his powers of intervention. In August he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the hardline Arizona former sheriff convicted of contempt of court in July for defying a judges order to stop racially profiling Latinos.\nSuch knowledge gave an uneasy undercurrent to Tuesdays event, usually a predictably gentle moment of levity in the presidential year. Each Thanksgiving the occupant of the White House is expected to be a convivial host and throw out a few jokes in a display of soft power. Barack Obamas puns (Yes, we cran) used to make his young daughters look like they wanted the ground to swallow them up. On this occasion, 11-year-old Barron looked on with a wry smile.\nHardly famous for his Wildean wit, Trump eschewed puns and acquitted himself better than his opponents might expect, though he could not resist some political comedy when considering Tater and Tot, two turkeys pardoned by Obama a year ago. In these polarised times, half of America is unlikely to see the funny side.\nAs many of you know, I have been very active in overturning a number of executive actions by my predecessor, he said, wearing a candy-cane pink tie. However, I have been informed by the White House counsels office that Tater and Tots pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked. So were not going to revoke them. So, Tater and Tot, you can rest easy.\nOn a more serious note, a man described as the most divisive president of modern times added: This Thursday, as we give thanks for our cherished loved ones, let us also renew our bonds of trust, loyalty, and affection between our fellow citizens as members of a proud national family of Americans.\nOnce the short ceremony was done Ivanka, her daughter Arabella, and Tiffany smiled as they touched the turkey. Ivankas husband Kushner was also present.\nJohn Kelly, the White House chief of staff, joked to reporters that he had advised Trump against the pardons, which mean that Drumstick and 36lb Wishbone, who was not present, will live at a Virginia Tech facility known as Gobblers Rest.\nSeventy years ago the National Turkey Federation first presented a Thanksgiving turkey to Harry Truman, who did not grant the pardon, Trump noted, adding: He was a tough cookie. George HW Bush established the annual pardon tradition in 1989 when he spared an unnamed 50lb turkey.\nTrump is due to head to Mar-a-Lago, his winter White House in Florida, later on Tuesday for Thanksgiving.",

We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors.

        "content": "Claim:\nDuring World War II, George Soros was a member of the SS (a Nazi paramilitary organization) or a Nazi collaborator who helped confiscate property from Jews.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs a prominent political activist and supporter of left-wing causes, Hungarian-born billionaire financier George Soros has frequently been the target of smear campaigns, and none more odious than the persistent  and false  claim that Soros, a Jew, was a Nazi sympathizer, collaborator, and/or paramilitary officer during World War II.\nThat Soros was only nine years old (born in 1930) when the war broke out and all of 14 when Nazi Germany surrendered in May 1945 hasn't dampened his detractors' enthusiasm for spreading these rumors, including the absurd claim, which first surfaced in November 2016, that Soros literally served as an officer of the paramilitary Schutzstaffel (SS) in Germany.\nHere are two examples via Twitter:\nThis allegation continues to make the social media rounds in the form of a black-and-white photograph of a young man  supposedly Soros  wearing an SS uniform (see above), accompanied by some version of this caption:\n.. I give you George Soros. A SS in the National Socialist German workers party. Nazi party. He served under Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler. He said it was the best time of his life. The destruction and agony around him was euphoric to him. This man was making policy with Hillary Clinton. And some of you think Trump is dangerous. Wow!\nWow, indeed. But given his age, Soros couldn't have joined the SS (whose minimum age requirement was 17) even if he had wanted to. Moreover, as a Hungarian Jew he couldn't have met the SS requirement for pure \"Aryan\" heritage. Quite to the contrary, Soros and his entire family were obliged to hide their identities and pose as Christians to avoid being forcibly housed in ghettos, interned in concentration camps, deported, or killed during the 10-month Nazi occupation of Hungary beginning in 1944.\nThe miscaptioned photo is easily debunked using a reverse image search. The young man in the Waffen-SS uniform is actually Oskar Groening, a Nazi who served at the Auschwitz concentration camp from 1942 through the end of the war. More than 70 years after this photograph was taken, Groening was found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews.\nWas Soros a Nazi Collaborator?\nIt is also claimed that Soros survived the German occupation of Budapest by becoming a Nazi \"collaborator.\" Fox News pundit Glenn Beck alleged in November 2010, for example, that the 14-year-old Soros \"help[ed] the government confiscate the lands of his fellow Jewish friends and neighbors,\" and, worse (in Beck's view), was unrepentant about it:\nSo when George Soros was 14, his father basically bribed a government official to take his son in and let him pretend to be a Christian. His father was just trying to keep him alive. He even had to go around confiscating property of Jewish people.\nNow, imagine you are Jewish and you have to go and confiscate the property of your fellow Jews. And you are pretending to not be a Jew and if anybody finds out, you're dead. He actually had to endure watching people sent off to their eventual murders, watching people gathering their stuff, sending them off knowing that they were going to go to their death.\n\"I don't want to question the 14-year-old,\" Beck disingenuously stated during a series of broadcasts devoted to painting Soros as an evil \"puppet-master\" of the left. \"I would have, however, liked to question the 80-year-old man who has never once said he regretted it,\" he added.\nCentral to Beck's case were quotes and clips from a 1998 60 Minutes interview (which can be viewed in its entirety here), an excerpt from which was also used as the centerpiece in a commentary on the conspiracist web site InfoWars.com in which host Alex Jones claimed that the teenaged Soros \"helped round up thousands of people\" and \"stole hundreds of millions of dollars\" from Hungarian Jews on behalf of the Nazi occupiers.\nConservative author Dinesh D'Souza (who has gone so far as to compare the 14-year-old George Soros to Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele) revived the \"Nazi collaborator\" claim in his 2017 book The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left, doubling down on it in a social media campaign to promote book sales:\nOther conservative and alt-right media figures followed suit:\nYet the simple truth is that George Soros neither said nor did anything resembling what he has been accused of. In no sense was Soros, who turned 14 years old not long after the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944, a \"Nazi collaborator.\" At no time did he confiscate (or help confiscate) the property of Jews, \"identify Jews to the Nazis,\" or help \"round up\" people targeted for deportation or extermination by the Germans (to answer just a few of the accusations leveled against him). And although Soros did attest during the infamous 60 Minutes interview that he regrets nothing about the time of German occupation, he also said it is precisely because he didn't do any of the things attributed to him that his conscience is clear.\nThe 60 Minutes Interview\nThe 60 Minutes interview is problematic in many regards, not least because Soros's testimony comes across as confused and contradictory. After assenting to Kroft's (inaccurate) statement that he \"helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews,\" a minute later Soros says he was only a spectator and played no role in that confiscation:\nKroft: \"My understanding is that you went ... went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.\"\nSoros: \"Yes, that's right. Yes.\"\nKroft: \"I mean, that's  that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?\"\nSoros: \"Not, not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don't ... you don't see the connection. But it was  it created no  no problem at all.\"\nKroft: \"No feeling of guilt?\"\nSoros: \"No.\"\nKroft: \"For example, that, 'I'm Jewish, and here I am, watching these people go. I could just as easily be these, I should be there.' None of that?\"\nSoros: \"Well, of course, ... I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away. But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there, because that was  well, actually, in a funny way, it's just like in the markets  that if I weren't there  of course, I wasn't doing it, but somebody else would  would  would be taking it away anyhow. And it was the  whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the  I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.\"\nSoros's biographer, Michael T. Kaufman, described Soros as \"visibly dumbfounded\" by Kroft's \"prosecutorial\" line of questioning during the interview. Kaufman addressed the claim that Soros was involved in confiscating Jewish property in his book, Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire (Knopf, 2002).\nWhile it's true, Kaufman wrote, that one of the jobs delegated to young George's temporary protector (a Hungarian bureaucrat named Baumbach) was taking inventory of Jewish properties already confiscated by the Nazis, the extent of Soros's participation was accompanying Baumbach on one of those assignments:\nShortly after George went to live with Baumbach, the man was assigned to take inventory on the vast estate of Mor Kornfeld, an extremely wealthy aristocrat of Jewish origin. The Kornfeld family had the wealth, wisdom, and connections to be able to leave some of its belongings behind in exchange for permission to make their way to Lisbon. Baumbach was ordered to go to the Kornfeld estate and inventory the artworks, furnishings, and other property. Rather than leave his \"godson\" behind in Budapest for three days, he took the boy with him. As Baumbach itemized the material, George walked around the grounds and spent time with Kornfeld's staff. It was his first visit to such a mansion, and the first time he rode a horse. He collaborated with no one and he paid attention to what he understood to be his primary responsibility: making sure that no one doubted that he was Sandor Kiss [Soros's assumed identity]. Among his practical concerns was to make sure that no one saw him pee.\nGeorge's father, Tivadar Soros, provided a similar account of the incident in his 1965 autobiography, Masquerade: Dancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary (note: Tivadar Soros gave the name of the ministry official as \"Baufluss,\" but Soros confirmed to us that the correct name is Baumbach):\nBaufluss was charged by the ministry with inventorying confiscated Jewish estates. He was home only at weekends; the rest of his time he spent taking inventory in the provinces. During the week George passed his time alone in Baufluss' s apartment. Lacking anything else to do, he caught the attention of some of his schoolmates, who lived in the building across the way. Communicating by hand signals, they seemed surprised to see him holed up in somebody else's house. The following week the kind-hearted Baufluss, in an effort to cheer the unhappy lad up, took him off with him to the provinces. At the time he was working in Transdanubia, west of Budapest, on the model estate of a Jewish aristocrat, Baron Moric Kornfeld. There they were wined and dined by what was left of the staff. George also met several other ministry officials, who immediately took a liking to the young man, the alleged godson of Mr Baufluss. He even helped with the inventory. Surrounded by good company, he quickly regained his spirits. On Saturday he returned to Budapest.\n\"He even helped with the inventory,\" Tivadar Soros wrote. It's a detail one doesn't find in Kaufman's book. Some may rush to cite this as proof that Soros was indeed a \"collaborator,\" but given that it occurred on only one occasion, and that Soros was under an imperative to play the part of Baumbach's godson while in the company of actual Nazi collaborators, it demands stretching the meaning of \"collaborator\" beyond all reasonable limits.\nMoreover, these biographical passages demonstrate that Steve Kroft's claim on 60 Minutes that Soros \"accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews\" is flat-out false. Tivadar Soros wrote that most of young George's time under Baumbach's care was spent alone in the latter's apartment. Both Tivadar and Kaufman report that George only resided with Baumbach for a short time  a matter of weeks  before Tivadar, concerned that his son's real identity was in danger of exposure, shipped him off to spend the summer of 1944 with his mother (who herself was living under an assumed name at a lakeside resort some distance from Budapest). George Soros spent no further time with Baumbach.\nDid Soros Serve Jews with Death or Deportation Notices?\nAnother \"Nazi collaborator\" trope holds that young George Soros helped send fellow Jews to their deaths by delivering deportation notices on behalf of Budapest's Jewish Council (Judenrat in German), an organization tasked by the Nazis with helping enforce Nazi policies on the Hungarian Jewish population:\nHowever, as in the case of the \"confiscation\" rumors already discussed, here we find innocuous facts about George Soros's adolescence twisted and exaggerated into a grotesque lie. According to Soros's father, school-age Jewish children were required to run errands for the council. Among those errands (he came to find out) was delivering deportation notices to prominent Jews. But although George did, in fact, spend all of two days as a Jewish Council errand boy, he didn't perform his assigned tasks exactly as ordered, taking it upon himself to warn the recipients of the notices that they ought not to comply:\nAs Jews couldn't go to school any more and their teachers couldn't teach, they were ordered to report to council headquarters. The children were enlisted as couriers under the command of their teachers. My younger son, George, also became a courier. On the second day he returned home at seven in the evening.\n'What did you do all day?'\n'Mostly nothing. But this afternoon I was given some notices to deliver to various addresses.'\n'Did you read what they said?'\n'I even brought one home.'\nHe handed me a small slip of paper, with a typewritten message:\nSUMMONS\nYou are requested to report tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock at the Rabbinical Seminary in Rokk Szildrd Street. Please bring with you a blanket, and food for two days.\nTHE JEWISH COUNCIL\n'Do you know what this means?' I asked him.\n'I can guess,' he replied with great seriousness. 'They'll be interned.'\nChildren are often good guessers. I wondered whether he knew what being interned meant. Did this child of mine realize that these people would be deported to Germany and very possibly murdered? I felt too ashamed of the world I had brought him into to enlighten him.\n'The Jewish Council has no right to give people orders like that,' I told him. 'You are not to work there any more.'\n'I tried to tell the people I called on not to obey,' he said, clearly disappointed that I wouldn't let him work any more. He was beginning to enjoy his career as a courier: it was all a big adventure.\nDid Soros Say Helping the Nazis was the Happiest Time of His Life?\nIn a foreword George Soros wrote for a 2001 reprint of Masquerade, he described the ten months of the Nazi occupation as \"the happiest times of my life\":\nI was fourteen years old. We were in great peril, but my father was seemingly in command of the situation. I was aware of the dangers because my father spent a lot of time explaining them to me but I did not believe in my heart of hearts that I could get hurt. We were pursued by evil forces and we were clearly on the side of the angels because we were unjustly persecuted; moreover, we were trying not only to save ourselves but also to save others. The odds were against us but we seemed to have the upper hand. What more could a fourteen-year-old want? I adored and admired my father. We led an adventurous life and we had fun together.\nPredictably, this statement has been repurposed by Soros's political enemies, usually in tandem with the false claim that he was a Nazi collaborator, as an admission of moral bankruptcy:\nBut at no time did Soros say \"helping Nazis\" was the happiest time of his life. As he has reiterated on numerous occasions, what he was referring to was the exhilaration of surviving the most perilous situation he and his family would ever face, under the guidance and tutelage of his father, whom George Soros saw as a heroic figure. \"It was his finest hour,\" Soros said of his father in his 2007 book, The Age of Fallibility:\n1944 became the formative experience of my life. I was fourteen and I had boundless admiration for my father. I absorbed and adopted his view of the world wholesale. As I have often said, the year of German occupation was a strangely positive experience for me. We were confronted by mortal danger and people perished all around us, but we managed not only to survive but to emerge victorious because we were able to help so many others. We were on the side of the angels and we triumphed against overwhelming odds. What more can a fourteen-year-old ask for?\nAnti-Defamation League Statement\nOne of the ironies of these attacks on Soros based on his survival of the Nazi occupation is that they use his own (and his father's) candid remembrances of the experience to vilify him. As Holocaust survivor and Anti-Defamation League Director Abraham Foxman stated in response to Glenn Beck's attempted takedown of Soros in 2010, regardless of how one feels about the adult George Soros and his politics, the attacks are morally repugnant and unacceptable:\nGlenn Beck's description of George Soros' actions during the Holocaust is completely inappropriate, offensive and over the top. For a political commentator or entertainer to have the audacity to say  inaccurately  that there's a Jewish boy sending Jews to death camps, as part of a broader assault on Mr. Soros, that's horrific.\nWhile I, too, may disagree with many of Soros' views and analysis on the issues, to bring in this kind of innuendo about his past is unacceptable. To hold a young boy responsible for what was going on around him during the Holocaust as part of a larger effort to denigrate the man is repugnant.\nThe Holocaust was a horrific time, and many people had to make excruciating choices to ensure their survival. George Soros has been forthright about his childhood experiences and his family's history, and there the matter should rest.",

Adam Schiff, a Democrat who represents Californias 28th Congressional District and recently took over as chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\nA March 21 Facebook post displays a picture of Schiff with wide eyes and says: \"Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to reach sexual harassment settlement with a 19 year old male. Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence that Schiff paid off anyone over sexual harassment allegations, let alone used taxpayer funds to do it.\nWe found the rumor posted all over Twitter, and one December 9, 2018 tweet in particular from a QAnon conspiracy theory account, which simply claimed the information came from \"congressional sources,\" was picked up and retweeted tens of thousands of times. The rumor seems have emerged as Congress worked toward the bipartisan passage of a bill that requires members to pay their own sex misconduct settlements.\nThe rumor stretched so far that it was found in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Times on Dec. 13, 2018. That account also failed to list any sources to back up the allegation.\nA spokesperson for Schiff told PolitiFact the conspiracy theory is completely false: \"This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account. It is obviously and categorically untrue.\"\nGoing back a bit further, we discovered a story about a supposed \"gay lover\" of Schiffs on the junk news website TheNetSpies from February 2018. The site is filled with questionable content, and its \"About Us\" page states its content comes in \"the form of sizzling OP-ED, hard nosed investigative journalism, and a bit of satire for laughs.\"\nThe story claimed to have had an exclusive interview with former Los Angeles Times assistant managing editor Christina Bellantoni (which they misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). In a supposed Skype interview, Bellantoni allegedly told the site a man named \"Will Bottom\" claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff. The NetSpies posted a picture of the abused man, but the photo is actually of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013.\nBellantoni got wind of the story months later (around the time the rumor was spreading across Twitter) and called it out as fake in a tweet.\n\"Thanks for flagging. This is some very seriously fake news,\" Bellantoni wrote. \"Clue No. 1: A website youve never heard of citing an LAT story that doesnt exist.\"\nOur ruling\nViral social media posts claim that Schiff used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment allegation with a \"a 19-year-old male.\"\nDespite the rapid spreading of the rumor, not a single credible news source picked up the story. The account could only be found in sporadic, unsourced social media posts and partially in a junk news website that used a fabricated interview and a phony photo.\nThis conspiracy theory is full-on Pants on Fire!",

Rowling has been known to reveal some shocking secrets from inside the Potter universe. Whether its a characters hidden past, a plot point we may have missed, or a look inside what our favorite witches and wizards are doing today, Rowling has proven time and time again that theres still plenty we dont know about the magical world of Hogwarts. But the authors latest bombshell really takes the cake: J.K. Rowling just announced that Daniel Radcliffe is Chinese.\nWhoa. Mind = blown!\nAs proof, the web site included a series of fake tweets by Rowling, allegedly made on 6 January 2017:\nThe tweets don't appear on the author's authentic Twitter timeline, and according to available biographical information, Radcliffe was born in London, and neither of his parents is of Chinese descent.\nClickHole, like its sister site The Onion, is an openly satirical web site.

The attendance numbers were disappointing for the Trump campaign, to say the least, as they had boasted in the days leading up to the event that they had received more than a million RSVPs for the event.\nAs Trump's defenders attempted to explain away the rally's poor attendance, some social media users attempted to flat out deny that the event was poorly attended by claiming that the media was lying about attendance figures, and by circulating photographs that they claimed showed how the arena was actually packed during the event.\nBelow is one such posting:\nThis appears to be a genuine photograph from a Trump rally  but it wasn't taken at the Tulsa rally in June 2020. This image appears to have been taken at a November 2019 Trump rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.\nThe BOK Center has the capacity for 19,000 people. According to the Tulsa Fire Department, the arena was less than half full during Trump's rally, with an attendance of 6,200 people.\nWhile the above-displayed post claims that the viral images of empty seats at Trump's Tulsa rally were taken before the event started, there are plenty of images showing these empty seats while Trump was on stage:\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump reelection campaign, disputed the fire department's count, arguing that there were closer to 12,000 people at the rally. Regardless, the above-displayed image was not taken at the BOK Center in Tulsa in June 2020.\nThe image in the viral Facebook post appears to show the scene at President Trump's rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida in November 2019. While it's difficult to read, the words \"Florida Welcomes\" seem to be written at the top of the jumbotron. Photographs and videos from this rally appear to show the same blue banner wrapped around the arena, the same division and color of seats, the same jumbotron, and the same setup for the stage as seen in the viral image.",

        "content": "This weekend in Tulsa, the president held his first campaign rally since March, after the coronavirus pandemic suspended the campaign trail. So we begin, Oklahoma we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma! It was also the weekend of Juneteenth. For many black Americans, Juneteenth is a celebration of the end of slavery in this country. This was a moment that resulted in scenes like this. You are a sellout! Black people die [inaudible] [shouting] The timing of the presidents rally, on the weekend of Juneteenth, also comes at a time where there have been weeks of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. Hands up! Dont shoot! It is particularly poignant in the South, and in Tulsa, because of the history of racial oppression here. Rather than a president that showed deference to the racial history of this city or to try to further the efforts of racial reconciliation, we saw him upend them. About the first grade, we came to Tulsa. We moved to Tulsa. So, I kind of grew up on Greenwood. When I entered college and took black history, and my professor, he said, Do you all know about the race massacre? And we were all like, No. We had a riot here? You know. And he was just like, OK, so everybody sit down and listen to this story. In the early 1900s, the Greenwood area of Tulsa was a thriving black neighborhood. African-Americans, two generations out of slavery, pursued and exhibited black excellence. We had our own banks and hospitals and theaters and restaurants. But that success didnt sit well with the white community. And in 1921, after a black man was accused of disrespecting a white woman, things escalated. A white mob burned and looted Black Wall Street. The violence lasted roughly 16 hours. They shot. They looted. They bombed. They threw bodies in the river. They threw them in mass graves. When the dust settled, some 100 to 300 people were killed. At least 1,250 homes were destroyed in the black community. Schools, churches and business were destroyed as well. Total devastation, like a war zone. What happened here was a momentous tragic event. That was the worst horrific story that I ever heard in my life. This church, we were building in 1921, our sanctuary  they destroyed that. And our basement miraculously survived. The damage on this pillar comes from when concrete burned. In this room, also we have soil collections from the different sites where people were killed. After years of ignoring the massacre, many in Tulsa want to make it front and center of the communitys conversation. They set up this bipartisan commission to do a number of initiatives to bring forward the issue of racial reconciliation and commemorate the centennial anniversary of the massacre. And some institutions have apologized. Im sorry that the police department did not protect its citizens during the tragic days of 1921. The hard part has been what to do next. We demand reparations in honor of all those Americans that were killed! We demand reparations now! Saying Im sorry is not repentance. You know, saying Im sorry just recognizes what you did is wrong. Repentance is turning away from what you did that makes you sorry. Before you can even get to atonement, we have to have a society that admits that white supremacy is wrong. Weve got to have a society that admits that black lives matter. The president has tried to present himself as a unifying figure, as someone who can bring the country together, particularly in times of these dual crises: the coronavirus pandemic and the national unrest around race and racial inequality. But this weekend shows his challenges on that front and the inability of this administration to, frankly, get out of its own way. Juneteenth is, for many black Americans, a celebration of the emancipation of slavery. The president initially announced a rally on Juneteenth. When you talk to people, they say there was a moment of disbelief that the president was coming to Tulsa. My first reaction was, How disrespectful. I felt like it was a slap in the face. And after pleas, even from Republican senators in the state, he moved the rally to the next day. Beep beep. Beep beep. Its important to me because its history, its freedom. Girl, youre looking good. Its good to see you, long time. Its education. You want to make America great again? You have to make Black Wall Street great again. And its important this year because people get to see that, hey, theyre still fighting for a cause, but theyre celebrating our freedom. To come on the weekend of Juneteenth shows that he has still not that much respect for our sacred day. Ultimately, the presidents rally wasnt as big as his campaign had hoped. But the significance of this weekend is seen in scenes like this. I see you back there shaking your head. Yes, sir, black lives matter. And one of the takeaways around this moment, around race in this country, has been the shifting public opinion about questions of systemic racism and persistent inequality. No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace! That lack of acknowledgement puts him at odds with even some members of his own party. The presidents strategy on race and on other issues has just narrowed his path to re-election. He has not shown a willingness to try to expand his base, leaving him fairly reliant on a similar group of voters that got him elected in 2016 to do so again in 2020.",

This is absolutely false.\nA look at the family lineages of each of these public figures provides further confirmation.\nGeorge Soros only brother, Paul Soros, died in 2013.

His two other children, Linda and Steven, both died as young children, according to The New York Times.\nWedding announcements published in The New York Times show Jeffrey Soros married Catherine Cosover in 1995 and Peter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997.\nSince George Soros has only two surviving nephews, Peter and Jeffrey, and neither married Gretchen Whitmer, its not possible Whitmer is George Soros niece.\nOn Whitmers side, she is the daughter of the late Sharon Whitmer, a former lawyer, and Richard Whitmer, also a lawyer and the former head of the health insurance association Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.\nWhitmer is married to Marc Mallory, a Michigan dentist.

        "content": "Claim:\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is the niece of billionaire George Soros.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn June 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was the niece of billionaire George Soros:\nThe variations of this rumor that we encountered on social media were not accompanied by any evidence to prove this familial connection. In fact, these postings weren't typically accompanied by any information about how this alleged discovery was made, nor did they include any arguments (logical or otherwise) in support of this claim. These postings merely consisted of an unverified statement that was seemingly pulled out of thin air.\nThis rumor, of course, is a familiar one. Billionaire George Soros frequently plays the part of the \"boogeyman\" in far-right conspiracy theories (he has been falsely accused of owning a lab in Wuhan, China, of funding refugees to storm the border of the United States, and paying people to stage protests). In some circles, Soros' name has become so synonymous with nefarious activity that purveyors of misinformation can simply suggest that a person or organization has connections to Soros in order to stir up controversy.\nDuring the impeachment investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018, for example, a false rumor was circulated on social media claiming that Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was related to Soros through his sister's husband. This is not true. In 2016, as former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was running for president, a false rumor was circulated claiming that her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was married to Soros' nephew. This, again, is not true.\nAs we've noted in previous articles, Soros had one brother, Paul, who died in 2013 and is survived by two sons, Peter and Jeffrey Soros. Paul Soros had two other children, but they both died in infancy. George Soros has no nieces, which makes this claim about Whitmer false on its face.\nOut of an abundance of caution, however, we reached out to Whitmer for comment. A spokesperson simply told us: \"The governor is not George Soros' niece.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nActor-comedian Bill Murray died at age 81 in February 2019, expressing a wish to see Americans united under Trump.\nOn 9 February 2019, the Conservative Tears website published an article reporting that actor-comedian Bill Murray had died at the age of 81, expressing that he \"wanted to see America unite under President Trump\":\nBill Murray Dead at 81  Wanted To See Americans United Under Trump\nWilliam Billington Bill Murray is dead this evening in his home in Winnetka, Wisconsin. Murray, who left public life a few years ago to pursue a more conservative lifestyle, found out he was dying about three months ago but decided not to make a big deal out of it.\nAccording to his spokesman and lawyer, Art Tubolls, Murray left very simple instructions for his passing:\nBill wanted to see America unite under President Trump and come together to fight against all the things hes fought against his entire career. When he wrote the movie Ghostbusters he used Slimer as an example of how feeding something causes dependence. Stripes was to teach the average American that anyone can be a hero if the timing is right.\nNone of this was true: at the time this report was published, Bill Murray was still very much alive and only 68 years old. The report of his death was another fabrication by Conservative Tears, a site which is part of the America's Last Line of Defense network of websites and Facebook pages that pump out a steady stream of inflammatory and politically divisive misinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"",

Adam Schiff (D-California) \"used taxpayer money\" to cover up a sexual-harassment accusation:\nIt's unclear where the rumor started, but on Twitter it was sometimes shared in association with a clearly bogus article from the junk news site TheNetSpies.com. That site is filled with obviously false information, and its \"About\" page states that \"If you like our reporting, kick up your feet, partake of your favorite intoxicant(s) and stay a while. If not, go ask your mommy to come down to the basement and nurse her 33 year old wuss.\"\nOn 11 February 2018, TheNetSpies.com published an article for which they alleged to have interviewed Los Angeles Times former Assistant Managing Editor Christina Bellantoni (which TheNetSpies misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). Bellantoni, they asserted, told the tale of a hapless (but non-existent) man named Will Bottom, who claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff, his \"gay lover.\" To illustrate this supposedly abusive relationship, the article repurposed an image of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn, New York, man who suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked and beaten in 2013.\nThe real Christina Bellantoni never spoke to anyone from TheNetSpies and took to Twitter to make it clear the story was falsified:\nThis isn't the only unfounded rumor to dog Schiff, who became chair of the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",

Adam Schiff, a Democrat who represents Californias 28th Congressional District and recently took over as chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\nA March 21 Facebook post displays a picture of Schiff with wide eyes and says: \"Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to reach sexual harassment settlement with a 19 year old male. Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence that Schiff paid off anyone over sexual harassment allegations, let alone used taxpayer funds to do it.\nWe found the rumor posted all over Twitter, and one December 9, 2018 tweet in particular from a QAnon conspiracy theory account, which simply claimed the information came from \"congressional sources,\" was picked up and retweeted tens of thousands of times. The rumor seems have emerged as Congress worked toward the bipartisan passage of a bill that requires members to pay their own sex misconduct settlements.\nThe rumor stretched so far that it was found in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Times on Dec. 13, 2018. That account also failed to list any sources to back up the allegation.\nA spokesperson for Schiff told PolitiFact the conspiracy theory is completely false: \"This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account. It is obviously and categorically untrue.\"\nGoing back a bit further, we discovered a story about a supposed \"gay lover\" of Schiffs on the junk news website TheNetSpies from February 2018. The site is filled with questionable content, and its \"About Us\" page states its content comes in \"the form of sizzling OP-ED, hard nosed investigative journalism, and a bit of satire for laughs.\"\nThe story claimed to have had an exclusive interview with former Los Angeles Times assistant managing editor Christina Bellantoni (which they misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). In a supposed Skype interview, Bellantoni allegedly told the site a man named \"Will Bottom\" claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff. The NetSpies posted a picture of the abused man, but the photo is actually of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013.\nBellantoni got wind of the story months later (around the time the rumor was spreading across Twitter) and called it out as fake in a tweet.\n\"Thanks for flagging. This is some very seriously fake news,\" Bellantoni wrote. \"Clue No. 1: A website youve never heard of citing an LAT story that doesnt exist.\"\nOur ruling\nViral social media posts claim that Schiff used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment allegation with a \"a 19-year-old male.\"\nDespite the rapid spreading of the rumor, not a single credible news source picked up the story. The account could only be found in sporadic, unsourced social media posts and partially in a junk news website that used a fabricated interview and a phony photo.\nThis conspiracy theory is full-on Pants on Fire!",

        "content": "Claim:\nEggs shouldn't be refrigerated in the United States.\nIn March 2021, a colorful advertisement appeared on websites that displayed ads from the Taboola advertising network. The text of the ad read: \"35 Foods That Should Never Be Placed in the Refrigerator.\" It showed a picture of eggs in a refrigerator overlaid with a large, red \"X.\" This seemed to imply that eggs shouldn't be refrigerated.\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a 35-page slideshow article. It mentioned 35 products that supposedly shouldn't be refrigerated.\nHowever, eggs never showed up in the story. The ad was nothing but clickbait.\nThe Dr. Health Magazine website did not list any medical professionals on its staff. The copyright date in the footer of the story was last updated in 2017. It did not appear to be a trustworthy source of information regarding health and well-being.\nShould Eggs Be Refrigerated?\nIn 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a rule to egg handlers. The announcement read as follows on the FDA website:\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a regulation expected to prevent each year approximately 79,000 cases of foodborne illness and 30 deaths caused by consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella Enteritidis.\nThe regulation requires preventive measures during the production of eggs in poultry houses and requires subsequent refrigeration during storage and transportation.\nEgg-associated illness caused by Salmonella is a serious public health problem. Infected individuals may suffer mild to severe gastrointestinal illness, short-term or chronic arthritis, or even death. Implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of Salmonella Enteritidis infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent.\nThe rule requires that measures designed to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis be adopted by virtually all egg producers with 3,000 or more laying hens whose shell eggs are not processed with a treatment, such as pasteurization, to ensure their safety.\nThe FDA also advised that eggs should be stored \"promptly in a clean refrigerator at a temperature of 40 F or below.\"\nAccording to The New York Times, the reason some other countries don't advise citizens to refrigerate eggs comes down to one thing: In the U.S., many eggs are washed at egg-production facilities to ward off salmonella concerns:\nWashing the eggs also cleans off a thin, protective cuticle devised by nature to protect bacteria from getting inside the egg in the first place. (The cuticle also helps keep moisture in the egg.)\nWith the cuticle gone, it is essential  and, in the United States, the law  that eggs stay chilled from the moment they are washed until you are ready to cook them. Japan also standardized a system of egg washing and refrigeration after a serious salmonella outbreak in the 1990s.\nIn sum, Dr. Health Magazine appeared to mislead readers by using a picture of eggs in its advertisement. The FDA has strongly advised that people living in the United States should keep their eggs refrigerated.",

        "content": "Go in search of eggs in most foreign countries and you might encounter a strange scene: eggs on a shelf or out in the open air, nowhere near a refrigerator.\nShock and confusion may ensue. What are they doing there? And are they safe to eat?\nWe Americans, along with the Japanese, Australians and Scandinavians, tend to be squeamish about our chicken eggs, so we bathe them and then have to refrigerate them.\nBut we're oddballs. Most other countries don't mind letting unwashed eggs sit next to bread or onions.\nThe difference boils down to two key things: how to go after bacteria that could contaminate them, and how much energy we're willing to use in the name of safe eggs.\nTo understand when the rift happened, let's rewind. About a hundred years ago, many people around the world washed their eggs. But there are a lot of ways to do it wrong, so the method got a bad reputation in certain parts of the world. A batch of rotten eggs, which had been washed in Australia, left a bad impression on its British importers.\nBy 1970, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had perfected the art of the wash with the help of fancy machines, and it required all egg producers to do it. Meanwhile, many European countries were prohibiting washing, and Asian countries never got on board with it. The exception was Japan, which joined the egg-washers after a bad spate of salmonella in the 1990s.\nSo what's the deal with washing and refrigeration? Soon after eggs pop out of the chicken, American producers put them straight to a machine that shampoos them with soap and hot water. The steamy shower leaves the shells squeaky clean. But it also compromises them, by washing away a barely visible sheen that naturally envelops each egg.\n\"The egg is a marvel in terms of protecting itself, and one of the protections is this coating, which prevents them from being porous,\" says food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of Egg: A Culinary Exploration of the World's Most Versatile Ingredient.\nThe coating is like a little safety vest for the egg, keeping water and oxygen in and bad bacteria out. Washing can damage that layer and \"increase the chances for bacterial invasion\" into pores or hairline cracks in the shell, according to Yi Chen, a food scientist at Purdue University. So we spray eggs with oil to prevent bacteria from getting in, and refrigerate them to keep microorganisms at bay.\nWhy go to the trouble of washing eggs? A lot of it has to do with fear of salmonella.\n\"It just sort of seeped into our culture that chickens are dirty, or crawling with bacteria,\" says Ruhlman. (The Salt stumbled into this when our post started a #chickens*$!storm.)\nSalmonella enteritidis can infect a chicken's ovaries, contaminating a yolk before the shell firms up around it. Cooking usually kills the bacteria before they can harm you; still, eggs contaminated with salmonella are responsible for about 142,000 illnesses a year in the U.S., according to the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn some European countries, egg-laying hens are vaccinated against salmonella. In the U.S., vaccination is not required, but eggs must be washed and refrigerated from farm to store, and producers must follow a host of other safety measures.\n\"They're different approaches to basically achieve the same result,\" says Vincent Guyonnet, a poultry veterinarian and scientific adviser to the International Egg Commission. \"We don't have massive [food safety] issues on either side of the Atlantic. Both methods seem to work.\"\nThe important thing, he says, is to be consistent.\n\"Once you start refrigeration, you have to have it through the whole value chain, from farm to store. Because if you stop  if the eggs are cold and you put them in a warm environment  they're going to start sweating,\" says Guyonnet.\nNo one wants sweaty eggs. They can get moldy. Another perk of consistent refrigeration is shelf life: It jumps from about 21 days to almost 50 days.\nIn a lot of countries, constant refrigeration just isn't possible because it's simply too costly.\n\"Some of the countries cannot afford cold storage during the whole supply chain,\" says Chen.\nAnd as for why the U.S. and Europe developed such different attitudes about washing, it's also hard to tease apart how much is about safety versus egg aesthetics.\n\"In North America, we like to have everything superclean. So they probably initiated the washing of the egg very early on,\" leading down the refrigeration path, says Guyonnet.\nBut in a lot of places, \"a dirty egg with poop on it is no big deal. You brush it off when you get home,\" says Guyonnet, who was raised in France and now lives in Canada.",

The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

        "content": "Claim:\nSamuel Pepys wrote about taverns being full of gadabouts during a plague in 1665.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn July 2020, a quote ostensibly written in 1665 by Samuel Pepys, dubbed the world's greatest diarist by some, started to circulate on social media. The passage lamented how \"gadabouts\" (defined by Cambridge Dictionary as \"a person who goes out a lot and does not worry about other things they should be doing\") were still frequenting taverns despite the risk of contracting the plague:\nThere are two slightly differing versions of the passage, one describing the taverns as \"full of gadabouts\" (as in the above meme), and the other describing them as \"fair full of gadabouts,\" as in the example below:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nSamuel Pepys, Great Plague 1665 MP and Diarist\n1633-1703\nThis is not a genuine quote from Pepys. This is a modern piece of writing that originated with a social media account parodying Pepys.\nPepys was a naval administrator and member of English Parliament. He was most famous, however, for recording a daily diary for nearly 10 years starting in 1660. Pepys wrote about several significant historical events during this time period, such as the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Great Fire of London, and the Great Plague of London in 1665. The above-displayed passage, however, was not written by him.\nThis quote originated with the Twitter account @Pepys_Diaries, a sort of parody account that reimagines Pepys as if he were a modern-day writer. This account provides a pretty big clue that these are not real quotes, as it uses the handle \"FakeyPepys.\" Also, it is noted in the account's bio that quotes from the real Pepys can be found on the Twitter account @SamuelPepys.\nOn March 20, 2020, the parody account posted the now-viral quote:\nOddly enough, this is not the only entity posting fake diary entries from Pepys as if they were written during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. On March 9, for instance, The Fence magazine published the \"Coronavirus Diaries of Samuel Pepys.\"\nPepysdiary.com, a website dedicated to Pepys' actual writings, addressed this misquote in a March 2020 article. The website noted that another quote from the parody account had also gone viral:\nTheres been a parody Samuel Pepys twitter account running for a while at @Pepys_Diaries. Its a modern-day take on Pepys, imagining him writing in the modern world. Unfortunately one of the accounts recent tweets, drawing parallels between the Plague and 2020s coronavirus, has been quoted out of context and spread around as if its a real excerpt from the diary. The tweet:\n\"On hearing ill rumour that Londoners may soon be urged into their lodgings by Her Majestys men, I looked upon the street to see a gaggle of striplings making fair merry, and no doubt spreading the plague well about. Not a care had these rogues for the health of their elders!\"\n(Update: Theres at least one more quote thats being passed around as if its genuine, but is also from the fake diary account:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nEnd update.)\nScreenshots of this, attributed to Samuel Pepys in 1664, get passed around Twitter and Facebook as if its a prescient example of Pepyss diarising. There are obvious things that point to why its not a real quote (as outlined in this Londonist article), and misuses of language that are apparent to those of us who read the real diary, but that doesnt stop those who arent too familiar with the period.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

They go through a lot just to bring forth new life.\nToday I cried bitterly because I lost a woman, we don't pray for things like this to happen but sometimes God may have other plans. Why is this woman's case so painful? She has been barren for 14 years! We have tried IVF & so many method known to man, the woman went through a lot.\nFinally God blessed her, it was way beyond science and human knowledge.

We lost a live just to deliver a new life today.\nPlease respect women because they pass through the valley of death to bring life. Respect your wife! Carrying your baby for 9 months is no jokes and labouring for hours to give birth to your children is a huge sacrifice.\nI pray to God to please protect everyone reading this, especially pregnant women, please put them in your prayers.

It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

Did he say the language of the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values?\nFULL ANSWER\nThe rumor that President Barack Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools originated from a satirical article posted last month by a fake news website under the headline Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. The site is designed to look like ABC News, but uses the URL abcnews.com.co, the first tip-off that this isnt a legitimate news site.\nThe made-up story begins: Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. It goes on to say the order makes it illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty, which also applies to public schools. Those who violate the order, the bogus story says, can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.\nThe satire becomes abundantly clear for those who read on. The story includes quotes from Sock it Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks and Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.\nAnd then theres this description of abcnews.com.co at the bottom:\nabcnews.com.co: Thanks to ABC News President & CEO, Dr. Paul Horner for making ABC News the greatest website in the universe.

Paul Horner is an internet satirist who has created many fake news websites, articles and hoaxes. He takes responsibility for the pledge article on another one of his websites. The phone number listed for the complaint department, as well as at the bottom of the article as an Obama administration hotline, is the number of the Westboro Baptist Church, which is best known for its anti-gay views and protests.\nAn executive order with the number 13738 does exist, but it deals with labor laws and the federal governments use of private contractors. It has nothing to do with the Pledge of Allegiance. Obama signed it on Aug. 23, and the text is available from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. The National Archives also publishes an official list of all executive orders issued by Obama.\nThere have been legal challenges, dating back decades, to school boards and other organizations that require the pledge to be recited, concerning the under God phrase or religious beliefs. The Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette in 1943 that it is unconstitutional to force children to recite the pledge in public schools. The court ruled that it violates their rights under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. But this does not make it illegal to display or recite the pledge, or to encourage it.\nSources\nObama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. abcnews.com.co. 31 Aug 2016.\nExecutive Order 13738 of August 23, 201.

        "content": "A federal appeals court here declared today that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional because the phrase ''one nation under God'' violates the separation of church and state.\nIn a decision that drew protest across the political spectrum, a three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the pledge, as it exists in federal law, could not be recited in schools because it violates the First Amendment's prohibition against a state endorsement of religion.\nIn addition, the ruling, which will certainly be appealed, turned on the phrase ''under God'' which Congress added in 1954 to one of the most hallowed patriotic traditions in the nation.\nFrom a constitutional standpoint, those two words, Judge Alfred T. Goodwin wrote in the 2-to-1 decision, were just as objectionable as a statement that ''we are a nation 'under Jesus,' a nation 'under Vishnu,' a nation 'under Zeus,' or a nation 'under no god,' because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion.'' [Excerpts, Page A20.]\nIf it stands, the decision by the nation's most liberal appellate court would take effect in several months, banning the pledge from being recited in schools in the nine Western states under the court's jurisdiction: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.\nThe panel's decision prompted an immediate reaction in Washington, where senators unanimously passed a resolution condemning the ruling and where dozens of House members gathered on the Capitol steps to recite the pledge and sing ''God Bless America.''

A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police (GMP) said: Officers responding to reports of a collapsed house in Ramsbottom have sadly found the body of a woman.\nFive properties were evacuated as a precaution and a small scene remains in place. Inquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident.\nAlthough formal identification of the body found has not taken place yet, police say they believe they know who the woman is, and her family are being supported. An earlier police report mistakingly said the woman was 79.\nOne local resident told the Manchester Evening News they believed the collapse was the result of an explosion, and assisted emergency services in evacuating residents.\nThey said: It was a loud bang. I got as far as the water pump and emergency services were already on scene. I thought there was going to be another explosion and thats why we needed to evacuate.\nI was allowed through and started to clear every building up to the football pitch to get them down to the garden centre. We then got residents back to their own property once it was safe.\nGreater Manchester fire and rescue service said it had dispatched three fire engines and a number of support units to the scene.\nA joint investigation is under way between Greater Manchester police, Greater Manchester fire rescue service and Bury local authority partners to establish the circumstances of the incident.\nSteve Wilcock, the incident commander at the scene on behalf of Greater Manchester fire and rescue service (GMFRS), said: I want to first pass on my condolences to the family and friends of the woman who tragically lost her life at this incident  our thoughts are with them at what must be an incredibly sad and difficult time.\nGiven the nature of this scene, I must also praise the professionalism and dedication of the firefighters who have worked here all night in the driving rain, as well as throughout the morning. An investigation is now under way so it would not be appropriate to speculate at this time on a probable cause.\nIts also important to place on record our appreciation for the help and cooperation of local people. Summerseat is a close-knit community and there has been an outpouring of support, with many neighbours offering their homes to those evacuated from roughly 20 houses last night. I am proud to serve this community and GMFRS, GMP, Bury council and other partner agencies will continue to work really hard today to do the best by local people without compromising the scene.\nA spokesperson for GMFRS said it was too early to determine the cause of the explosion.",

Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one  or more!  of CJ Trinidads shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

        "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994  and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork  depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries  was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\nThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994, the posts read. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airports public art available on the airports website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is not from DENs art collection. The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. Its called Children of the World Dream of Peace, but it doesnt include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting  posted by Trinidad days earlier  on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece Maskcommunication.\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, United Against Corona- Express through Art, by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the [d]ate of submission as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February  though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name NEHA appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting  and well update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994  and its false to say that its a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nBill Gates is being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations.\nDuring the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020, a popular social media meme asserted that philanthropist Bill Gates was partnered with business magnate George Soros in owning a lab in Wuhan, China (the presumed location where the COVID-19 outbreak originated), and was being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations:\nIt is true that the Microsoft co-founder, through his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has expended billions of dollars funding research and childhood-immunization programs in developing countries. Gates, who has long warned that we are inadequately prepared to deal with global pandemics, has also pledged to make billions of dollars available for funding the manufacture of vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a member of the Leadership Council for the Gates Foundation's Decade of Vaccines Collaboration effort launched in 2010.\nHowever, the meme jumps the rails at suggesting anything more than that Gates is interested in improving lives through medical research and vaccinations.\nGates does not own a lab in Wuhan, China, in partnership with Soros; that claim is a combination of two separate and false rumors that we have already debunked at length: that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was deliberately engineered as a bioweapon, and that Soros owns the laboratory in Wuhan where the alleged development of the virus supposedly took place.\nThe rumor that \"India is suing Bill Gates because he vaccinated 77,000 third world girls between the ages of 9 & 15 and many of them died\" is also a false one that we have explored at length. This claim is not directly connected to Gates or the Gates Foundation, but rather to the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), which conducted a study beginning in 2009 to see if it could reduce the number of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. (The Gates Foundation was one of PATH's global partners and reportedly provided funding for its HPV study.) The study caused controversy in India when seven of the girls involved in the trial in that country died after receiving their vaccines, but state investigations found those deaths were unrelated to the vaccinations:\nState investigations absolved the trial's managers  PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi  of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was \"very unlikely\" to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as \"unlikely.\" ICMR's director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: \"Based on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,\" he insists.",

(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

And in June 2019, we came to believe that she had most likely been killed, police said.\nWe now believe there was no abduction and there was never any genuine negotiations. In other words there was a clear and well-planned attempt at misleading the police, the statement added.\nThe Norwegian legal system allows police to hold an individual on suspicion of a crime before formal charges are brought.\nHagens attorney, Svein Holden, said his client denies the accusations.\nHe strongly maintains that he has nothing to do with this, he told a group of reporters, according to Reuters.\nHagen will appear in court on Wednesday, the news agency reports.\nPolice asked the court to remand Hagen in custody for four weeks, with a ban on visits and outside communication, according to the statement.\nThey initially kept Anne-Elisabeths disappearance a secret in a bid to protect her but then made the case public in January 2019.\nWe can confirm that there is a ransom, and that serious threats have been issued, ystein Stavdal Paulsen, senior adviser of Norways East Police District, told CNN at the time.\nRegarding the ransom, we do not want to confirm what amount or in what form, he added.\nNRK reported at the time that multiple messages were found inside the Hagens home and that a ransom had been demanded in the cryptocurrency Monero.\nHagen, a real estate investor and power facilities owner, is one of Norways richest men, with a net worth of around $200 million, according to Norwegian financial magazine Kapital.\nAnne-Elisabeth Hagen was a board member of her husbands holding company until September, according to NRK.\nThe couple lived in Fjellhamar, a village about 12 miles northeast of Oslo, according to Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. The couple married in 1979 and have three adult children, it said.",

Police said they had no suspects at this stage.\nAccording to the daily newspaper Verdens Gang, the ransom demand was for 9m (8m) in the cryptocurrency Monero.\nInvestigators refused to confirm the amount but said they advised the family not to pay the purported kidnappers.\nSuch events are extremely rare in the Scandinavian country, which enjoys a generally low crime rate.\nPolice have been investigating the case discreetly for several weeks but decided to make it public in the hope someone would come forward with information, Brske said.\nBrske said investigators had had very limited contacts with the purported kidnappers online, but refused to disclose the date of the most recent contact.\nThe missing womans husband, Tom Hagen, also 68, is Norways 172nd richest man, according to the magazine Kapital, with an estimated fortune of 1.7bn kroner (156m).\nThe real estate investor owns 70% of the electricity company Elkraft, which he co-founded in 1992, Norwegian media reported.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" that covers over 8% of the Pacific Ocean.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nOn 26 July 2015, the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" Facebook page shared a photograph purportedly showing the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\":\nALthough the claim associated with the photograph  that a massive garbage patch covers 8.1% of the Pacific Ocean  has been advanced by some scientists, this image does not specifically depict that particular collection of ocean-borne trash. The photograph seen here shows debris resulting from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake (and resulting tsunami) that struck northern Japan in 2011:\nAn aerial view of damage to Wakuya, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area in northern Japan. Ships and aircraft from the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group are conducting search and rescue operations and re-supply missions as directed in support of Operation Tomodachi throughout northern Japan.\nFurthermore, National Geographic reported that while the name \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" may conjure up an image of a floating island of debris, the actual garbage patch itself was actually difficult to see:\nFor many people, the idea of a garbage patch conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics cant always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesnt show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes. The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nThe claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers \"8.1 percent of the Pacific Ocean\" is also a matter of debate. The number appeared to come from a 2008 quote from Marcus Eriksen, the research director at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation:\n\"Charles Moore, an American oceanographer who discovered the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" or \"trash vortex\", believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region. Marcus Eriksen, a research director of the US-based Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which Mr Moore founded, said: \"The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on. It is not quite like that. It is almost like a plastic soup. It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States.\"\nA 2011 study from Oregon State University, however, asserted that the real size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was hundreds of times smaller than commonly claimed:\nThere is a lot of plastic trash floating in the Pacific Ocean, but claims that the \"Great Garbage Patch\" between California and Japan is twice the size of Texas are grossly exaggerated, according to an analysis by an Oregon State University scientist.\nFurther claims that the oceans are filled with more plastic than plankton, and that the patch has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950s are equally misleading, pointed out Angelicque \"Angel\" White, an assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State.\n\"There is no doubt that the amount of plastic in the world's oceans is troubling, but this kind of exaggeration undermines the credibility of scientists,\" White said. \"We have data that allow us to make reasonable estimates; we dont need the hyperbole. Given the observed concentration of plastic in the North Pacific, it is simply inaccurate to state that plastic outweighs plankton, or that we have observed an exponential increase in plastic.\"\nThe studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically \"cohesive\" plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.\n\"The amount of plastic out there isn't trivial,\" White said. \"But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.\"\nBut a study published in 2018 stated the opposite of many of these assertions -- that the Pacific Ocean trash pile was much larger than previously reported and rapidly growing, that most of its bulk was larger objects rather than microplastics, and that about one-fifth of its volume came from the 2011 Japan earthquake referenced above:\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n\"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\nWhy the discrepancy? A variety of factors made it difficult to posit an accurate estimate of the debris field's true scope in earlier surveys:\nNo one knows for how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortexs area nearly impossible to measure.",

I had the great privilege of being a friend of Chris and invited to be a member of his family. Then, accompanied by Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson on guitar, he sang Hallelujah. Bennington had become famous in the early 2000s as the powerhouse voice of one of rocks biggest bands, expressing himself through an angst-ridden scream, but that day his singing was different: plaintive, somber, fragile.

(Linkin Park had a photo shoot scheduled for the morning of the 20th.) TMZ reported that police had found a partially empty bottle of alcohol in the bedroom where he had died.\nBennington had always been open about his struggles with addiction and depression, but those close to him were shocked by his suicide. The day after Cornells memorial, Bennington tweeted that he was feeling very creative and had written six new songs. Around the same time, he told a friend, Rene Mata, We have to stick together, and we have so much to live for.\nEditors picks\nBennington had reason to be happy: Linkin Parks new album, One More Light, had topped the charts when it was released in May, and a single, Heavy, was doing well on rock radio. In addition to the Linkin Park tour, he was planning a reunion with his pre-fame grunge band, Grey Daze, for September. He was on top of the world, says Sean Dowdell, drummer for Grey Daze and a friend of Benningtons since their teens, who last talked to him two days before his death.\nSteve Stevens, who plays guitar with Billy Idol, remembers Bennington holding a new puppy while greeting everyone who came backstage at an event last October for Rock to Recovery, an organization for sober musicians. He was making sure that everybody got to meet the dog at the door, he says. It was so endearing and so Chester.\nHe was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, its horrifying  longtime friend Ryan Shuck\nOn Linkin Parks European tour in June and July, Bennington seemed to be in top form. We saw the most alive and present Chester of my 15-and-a-half-year history with the band, says Jim Digby, the groups director of touring. He was arguably in the best physical condition of his life.\nA few days before his death, Bennington had been texting with Robert DeLeo, his bandmate in Stone Temple Pilots (Bennington fronted the band from 2013 to 2015 after Scott Weiland left the group). His messages were loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things, DeLeo recalls. And the day before he died, Bennington e-mailed former Guns N Roses drummer Matt Sorum, saying hed like to perform again with their all-star covers band, Kings of Chaos.\nBut some of Benningtons friends now feel they overlooked signs that the singers dark side  which he called his dark passenger, a reference to the force that motivated the serial-killer protagonist on TVs Dexter  had been creeping back into his life. Bennington had gone to rehab around 2006 and appeared to be sober in the years after. But friends say he suffered a three-day relapse last August, during which he blacked out from alcohol, and had been drinking as recently as October.\nA month before his death, Bennington told longtime friend Ryan Shuck, who played guitar in Benningtons side project Dead by Sunrise, that he was six months sober. But Bennington also sent Shuck, who had his own struggles with alcoholism, some text messages that seemed portentous in hindsight: He was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, its horrifying. He was telling me, down to the detail, what he would do in the first hour he wanted to drink: I basically just take it hour-by-hour every day. \nBennington talked about his issues in an interview in February with Music Choice. I have a hard time with life, he said while describing the meaning behind the hit Heavy. Even when its good, I just am uncomfortable all the time. . . . The opening line, I dont like my mind right now  like, that is me 24 hours a day. And if I get stuck in here, like, I just find life really hard. It doesnt have to be.\nRelated\nShuck believes Bennington had a couple of drinks just before his death. We dont know how much, but it doesnt take much when youre that advanced an alcoholic and an addict and youre battling to the extent he described to me. You dont need much to lose your mind for a minute.\nShuck and Dowdell downplay speculation that Cornells death inspired Benningtons. While there are similarities  both artists hanged themselves, and Bennington did so on what would have been Cornells 53rd birthday  they believe it was mostly a coincidence. It could be a part of it, but its a small part of it, Shuck says. I think that its just another horrible event that gets put in your subconscious. Its kindling, but the fire was already burning.\nBenningtons troubles go back to a nightmarish childhood. He was born on March 20th, 1976, in Phoenix, the youngest of four children. His mother, Susan, was a nurse; his father, Lee, was a police detective who investigated child-sex crimes. They divorced when Chester was 11, and, feeling abandoned by his mother, he lived with his dad, whom he later said was not emotionally stable at the time.\nFrom the time Chester was seven or eight until he was 13, he was sexually abused by an older male friend. I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didnt want to do, he once said. It destroyed my self-confidence.\nThe experience led Bennington to explore drugs and alcohol. By his teens, he had used opium, amphetamines, marijuana and cocaine. Id drink so much that Id shit my pants, he once said. Bennington claimed to have kicked substance abuse the first time in 1992, when a local gang burst into a place where he was getting high with his friends and beat and robbed them.\nBennington poured his experiences into Linkin Parks songs, which mixed his soul-baring screams with Mike Shinodas rapping and the bands lumbering riffs for a sound that dominated the pop charts for much of the 2000s. He had a distinct voice, at once delicate and ferocious, says actor and 30 Seconds to Mars frontman Jared Leto, who met Bennington on the festival circuit in the 2000s (30 Seconds to Mars also toured with Linkin Park in 2014). Its the angel and the demon, sitting on both shoulders. You could feel the tension between the two when he sang, and I think the reason so many people connected to his music was because of that balance he achieved between the two.\nBenningtons songs, many co-written with Shinoda, became anthems for young people struggling with some of the same emotional issues.  Crawling, for example, is probably the most literal song lyrically Id ever written for Linkin Park, Bennington said of the single, off the bands megaselling 2000 debut, Hybrid Theory. Thats about feeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol.\nThose who knew him say Bennington didnt let his struggles define his personality. He could be funny in a juvenile way one minute (he was a fan of scatological humor) and deeply sensitive the next: Shuck recalls Bennington kicking himself endlessly after making a joke about lung cancer onstage.\nHis messages were loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things, Robert DeLeo recalls.\nBennington would sometimes tell bands that opened for Linkin Park, Next time we might be opening for you guys. Sorum remembers how hed asked the Kings of Chaos band members to do a gig shortly before Christmas. Bennington and DeLeo were laid over for 12 hours in Chicago, and the drummer felt horrible for keeping them from home during the holiday season. I e-mailed those guys and said, I apologize. Im so sorry. Thank you so much for going the distance,  Sorum says. And typical Chester style, he e-mailed back: Anytime, bro. There was no drama. Nothing.\nAt home, Bennington found solace in his six kids. Hed become a father for the first time at age 20, and first got married in 1996. That relationship ended in a tumultuous divorce, marked by a relapse where I drank myself to the point where I couldnt leave the house and I couldnt function, he recalled. I wanted to kill myself. He married Talinda in 2005, and the couple had a son and twin daughters. Leto remembers going to Benningtons house for dinner one night. I walk in and its just jam-packed with the biggest family youve ever seen, he says. I just couldnt believe that he had such a beautiful and thriving family life, especially for someone so young. I hadnt seen so much of that [in him], spending time on the road.\nHe always had enjoyable tales of his six kids, which he always referred to with a beaming smile, no matter what kind of parental woe might have had him do a double take, says ZZ Tops Billy Gibbons, who toured with Bennington in Kings of Chaos within the past year. His tattoo-parlor business was another highlight; he had me designing silver jewelry for the Las Vegas shop where we whiled away the hours talking shop. He was really an engaging soul.\nIn late July, Shuck paid tribute to Bennington at a private service in Los Angeles, where he read a eulogy alongside Linkin Parks Joe Hahn and Shinoda. (The members of Linkin Park, as well as Talinda Bennington, declined to be interviewed for this story.)\nBenningtons death is still resonating among his fans, who experienced a shock wave when the news reached the public. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline says it received a 14 percent spike in calls on the day after the news broke.\nTen days after Benningtons death, the singers home was encircled with a temporary six-foot fence. A police cruiser sat outside as fans left flowers, drawings, signs, guitar picks and crosses on its perimeter. When I found out, I was at a museum, and I just bawled my eyes out, said 19-year-old Briana Yah-Diaz. It was like a piece of my childhood went away. The little-girl part of me needs to come up and pay my respects. . . . I could always count on them.\nOutside his home, one note read, Fly free now! With love all the way from Texas. Another said, Dear Chester Bennington, It hurts all of us to know that you saved so many lives, yet we couldnt save you. . . .\nAdditional reporting by Steve Appleford\nAll donations to Music For Relief will now be directed to the One More Light Fund in honor of Bennington",

        "content": "Claim:\nA line from George Orwell's novel 1984 predicts the power of smartphones.\nIn June 2017, a quote, purportedly taken from George Orwell's novel 1984, spread widely online, forming the basis for several memes that presented it as a remarkable prediction of the power and ubiquitousness of smartphones.\nReviewing Robert Icke and Duncan MacMillan's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2017, the Australian news web site News.com called it a \"quote from the production\" and added:\nThe line is from one of the characters that works for the Government, otherwise known as Big Brother. He says: The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice whats happening.\nAnd in its review of the play, which came to New York's Broadway in July 2017, the Spectrum News NY1 TV channel also highlighted the quotation:\nPerhaps most terrifying of all is hearing O'Brien seeming to predict our current state of apathy, saying, \"The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what's happening.\" In 2017, \"1984\" resonates louder than ever.\nWhat neither of these reviews make clear, and what the many memes get wrong, is that these words weren't written by George Orwell in 1949, and do not appear in the novel 1984.\nDespite a thorough search of the 2016 Enrich Spot e-book edition of 1984, we were unable to find these lines in the original novel. However, they resemble a speech from the book, made by O'Brien, a member of \"the Party\" who works at the Ministry of Truth:\nThe proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.\nAt another point in the original novel, the protagonist Winston notes: \"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.\"\nThe earliest iteration of the quotation on Twitter dates to July 2014, during the play's second run at the Playhouse Theatre in London. (It was first staged in 2013). During the same run, a second tweet attributes the lines to the stage adaptation. However, soon afterwards, the quote began to be falsely attributed to the 1949 novel, rather than the 2014 theater adaptation.\nThe revival of the play in Australia and then New York during the summer of 2017 has led to a resurgence in social media posts and memes falsely attributing the line to George Orwell's 68-year-old novel.",

The pictures are all in black and white, but the prostheses will be featured in vivid color images. The initiative is a way to show that physical limitations can not take away a woman's most valuable asset: pride.\nBanker Jaqueline Felizberto opened up in the photographs.

        "content": "Claim:\nA man in Ireland earned the nickname \"Shawshank Husband\" after he dug a tunnel from his bedroom to a local pub over the span of 15 years.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nInternet legend has it that an Irish plumber spent 15 years digging a tunnel from his house to a local pub so that he could enjoy a drink at his leisure without his wife's permission. This story has appeared on several web sites over the years, and despite its rather ludicrous premise it has repeatedly taken in some gullible social media users.\nThis rumor started with a September 2014 post on the web site \"Tyrone Tribulations\" entitled \"Omaghs Shawshank Husband Dug Tunnel from Bedroom to Pub Over 15 Years\":\nAn Omagh plumber tunnelled a hole from under his bed to the local pub 800 feet from his house over the course of 15 years, a court heard today.\nPatsy Kerr had been summonsed to Omagh County Court after it emerged he had been the cause of a collapsed sewage pipe from a neighbouring house. Kerr told the court about his secret tunnel and the reasons behind it:\nThe wife has a bad snore on her and after watching the Shawshank Redemption on RTE one night in 1994, I decided to do something about it so I waited til she was in a deep sleep and then set about digging a hole under the bed in the direction of the pub. I used all manner of tools from spoons to a heavy duty tunnel boring machine I managed to sneak down there when she was at the shops. It wasnt until 2009 that I hit the jackpot and came up through the womens toilet mop and bucket room.\nThe story was picked up by viral web sites such as Boing Boing and BuzzFeed (both of which later admitted that they had been fooled) before it spread to less reputable sites such as 8shit.net. As of October 2018, web sites such as mens-corner.net were still presenting this story as if it were a genuine piece of news.\nThis tale, however, is just a humorous bit of fiction.\nTyrone Tribulations did not specifically mark this story as satire, but it was replete with sufficient ridiculous details to clearly indicate that it was a work of fiction. The most telling aspect is likely found in the closing paragraph, which depicts a wife who simply shrugged off the fact that her husband routinely smelled of sewage:\nThe tunnel was finally discovered after the DOE performed a survey on a sewage problem which turned out to be caused by a pipe Kerr had hit accidentally, causing sewage to leak into his tunnel over five years. The judge questioned Kerrs wife as to why she never smelt the sewage odours from her husband. Mrs Kerr simply shrugged.\n\"Gombeen,\" the author of the article, also provided some humorous explanations when readers questioned the authenticity of his reporting. When asked how this Irish plumber could have seen the Shawshank Redemption in 1994 when the film wasn't released in Ireland until 1995, Gombeen remarked that years work strangely in the Emerald Isle. And when queried why this man would bother digging a tunnel when he could have just walked out of the front door given that his wife was such a sound sleeper (she apparently wasn't bothered by the noise of his power tools), Gombeen averred that the floorboards in Omagh are extra squeaky:\nTyrone Tribulations frequently publishes humorous material that pokes fun at life in Ireland. Although the site does not carry a disclaimer explicitly labeling its content as satire, they do state that the accuracy of their stories \"cannot be guaranteed.\"\nWe reached out to the site to confirm that this was a bit of fiction and asked the proprietor, \"Paudge McGaudge,\" what it was like to unwittingly fool thousands of people:\nI completely made the story up -- that's what my website does ... short local fictional stories. I've written 1000s now since 2012 but that was by far the most successful. I just thought about it driving home from work and wrote it up on my kitchen table in about 20-30 mins in Sept 2014. Within days it took off. I think the big pulls were: it being read out on BBC Radio 2 during the day as a funny real story; John Cusack tweeting about it; and Buzzfeed running with it before they realised it was fake. I don't mean to catch people out and take no pleasure in doing that -- I just like writing stories to make people laugh.",

        "content": "Claim:\nSarah Palin wants to ban \"Arabic numerals\" from American schools.\nIn April 2016, a story popped up on a hoax news web site reporting that former Alaska governor (and John McCain's running mate in the 2008 Presidential race) Sarah Palin took to Facebook to demand a ban on \"Arabic numerals\" in U.S. schools:\nIn keeping with the Republican partys platform of proposed safeguards, Palin also called for advanced screening for all teachers:\nIf foreign elements can swimmingly cross over the river and through the woods, they can just as easily infiltrate the teaching profession in ways we must not encourage. These dangerous foreign walk-overs who look more and more like real every-day normal Americans, lured with gift baskets and teddy bears, often blend into the very footholds of our societal norms after establishing dangerous toeholds.\nPalin, known as a vocal and athletic supporter of Donald Trump, said that she is now a double-barreled, locked and loaded supporter of both Trumps and Ted Cruzs proposed guidelines for stricter immigration laws, border protections and neighborhood scrutinies.\n-An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Mrs. Palins call for the removal of Aerobics from physical education courses. The author regrets the error.\nThere is no truth to this story, which came from a well-known (and prolific) hoax and satire news site. The joke in this case is that \"Arabic numerals\" (also known as Hindu-Arabic numerals) are the numbers most familiar to much of the world, and originated in India during the 6th or 7th century. They were introduced to Europe by mathematicians from what is now the Middle East (shown here as they appeared in the Codex Vigilianus around the 10th century):\nPalin has thrown her political backing behind Trump, and has been active on traditional and social media expressing that support. However, she has made no mention of banning numbers, whether of Hindu-Arabic or Roman origin.",

Visitor numbers are limited to 30% of the parks 80,000 usual capacity.\nOnly visitors with a green rating on Chinas health QR code app will be allowed through the gates, further embedding the use of the digital passport-like documents that have allowed some Chinese citizens to move relatively freely, but which have restricted others.\nSome facilities such as childrens play areas and theatre shows remain closed. No parades or night shows will run either.\nClose interaction and close-up photos with characters will be suspended during the initial phase of reopening, Shanghai Disney Resort said in a statement.\nDisney closed the Shanghai park on 24 January, before closing other theme parks across the world in March. However, the US entertainment company is eager to reopen facilities and try to make back lost revenues.\nThe Walt Disney Companys net income fell by 91% in the first three months of the year compared with 2019, as the company revealed a $1.4bn (1.1bn) cost from the pandemic.\nThe company was heavily exposed to the virus, which forced the cancellation of cruises and the closure of the cinemas playing its blockbuster films  although the timely launch of its new streaming service, Disney+, has cushioned some of the blow.\nThe group also scrapped its dividend, but it drew criticism from Bernie Sanders, the former US Democratic presidential candidate, and Abigail Disney, an heir to the Disney fortune, after it furloughed more than 100,000 employees to save money on salaries, despite retaining large rewards for its leaders.",

Although the Tumblr page stated that their material consisted of \"100% sourced and verified quotes,\" we investigated several of the entries shared by that page and found all of them to be false.\nThe Tumblr page made its agenda clear in its description, \"Get to know the psychopath known as Hillary Clinton a little better.\"\nWe attempted to unearth this quote in the pages of Clinton's 1996 book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, but (unsurprisingly) came up empty-handed.\nThe only credible publication to connect this quote to Hillary Clinton was the Tallahassee Democrat. That connection, however, was posted on 26 October 2015 (a day after the putative quote appeared on the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr page) and appeared in the web site's \"Zing\" section, which features opinions and \"snappy one-liners\" from anonymous users.\nWhile it's true that Hillary Clinton published a book in 1996 called It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, it does not include the statement in question, and Clinton (a parent herself) has not said at any point that she believes children should be raised primarily by the state, with their parents taking a secondary role.",

        "content": "Claim:\nImages shared widely in September 2019 showed people easily climbing the same fence, or same type of fence, that U.S. President Donald Trump said \"can't be climbed.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn September 2019, some online observers attempted to ridicule U.S. President Donald Trump's boasts about the impenetrability of his southern border wall by juxtaposing his claims that the wall could not be climbed with video footage of what was presented as people climbing the wall.\nIn a widely shared tweet on Sept. 21, one user wrote:\n\"Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed. But Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\"\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump's September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \"Trump's fancy border fence...\" while another user joined in, adding \"But ... he said that you could 'fry an egg.'\"\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \"This wall can't be climbed,\" next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump's claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump's election as president.\nAnalysis\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure's resistance, the administration had invited 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \"This was the one that was hardest to climb,\" Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they're unbelievable climbers. This wall can't be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it's also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it's designed to absorb heat. So it's extremely hot. The wall is -- you won't be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot. So if they're going to climb it, they're going to have to bring hoses and water and we don't know where they're going to hook it up because there's not a lot of water out here. So it's a very, very hard thing to climb.\"\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump's claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it's clear that Trump's Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president's claim that \"this wall can't be climbed\" were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump's long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. ... This wall can't be climbed.\" So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump's claims.\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does)  a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \"can't be climbed,\" in September 2019:\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president's assertions, \"Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\"\nHowever, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \"very, very hard thing to climb.\" Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump's boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

Although he shot a video directly after the purported conversation, he apparently didn't capture evidence that it happened as described (or at all).\nGas stations are frequently targeted for rumors of insufficient patriotism and various versions of the \"Shunned Serviceman\" urban legend. Modern (mostly invented) repetitions of the such rumors have circulated in Illinois, on Long Island, and in Holly, Michigan.\nIn some e-mailed variations of this rumor which we received, readers asked if Pilot Flying J had announced that they would be removing all American flags, everywhere:\nPilot and Flying J truck stops announced they were taking down the American Flag. They started the American Flag was offensive to the foreign truck drivers. Well screw them I will not stop or use these truck stops or gas stations ever again. I cut up my Pilot rewards gas card.\nAs is often the case with claims about \"offensive\" American flags or unpatriotic gas stations, Moore's story spread quickly, accruing nearly three million views in under a week. One day after it was posted, Pilot Flying J addressed the rumor on social media, stating that the store in question lacked a U.S. flag because a damaged flagpole there was in the process of being repaired:\nIn their Facebook post, Pilot Flying J reported that a \"team member was misinformed,\" but the company did not provide any more detail about the nature of that misinformation.\nA public relations firm representing Flying J sent us a response to our inquiry about the issue which stated that:\nI want to re-iterate that the current policy is that an American flag can only be displayed at our locations if it can be flown according to military protocol. The flag at store #436 in Amarillo, TX was not being flown as the pole is broken and prevents the flag being flown according to protocol.\nWe apologize the store manager did not have this information. We are still investigating all the details behind this miscommunication, but what we can tell you is what the situation at hand truly is, and that we are working to fix the pole at this location and are currently surveying our locations with flag poles to review if they are in proper working condition.",

My son gave me a potted plant for my birthday. I kept it on my kitchen counter until this week when it was warm enough to plant outside.\nI took it out to plant and tried to get it out of the pot with no luck. So I wet it really well, and the plant came out. It was in a decorative glass container with no holes in it and had a plastic pot cut and wedged into the glass pot. After I planted the flower, I tried to get the plastic pot out of the glass one by wedging a knife around the sides. When I did this, something moved. It looked like a snake, so I called my son outside. He took the liner out, and to our surprise, we found not one snake, but two baby copper heads!\nI almost died! I've been upset since then. When we took the plastic pot from the glass one, there was a piece of card board along the side. We think there must have been eggs in the holes of the cardboard at the grower's nursery. They must have hatched later.\nI am sending you pictures. Take my advice, and don't bring plants inside. This could have been really  really bad. This plant was bought at the grocery store. I will not give the name of the store, because I don't want to ruin their business. I'm sure it wasn't anything they knew about. It's the grower that should be more careful in potting these plants. I just want to warn you guys not to bring plants inside. Who knows what could be lurking under those roots? I am only thankful this was not a plant to be kept inside.\nThe lack of any identifying details about when, where, and under what circumstances these e-mailed photographs were taken makes their accompanying back story difficult to verify and leaves open the possibility that (as often happens) they were simply innocuous pictures to which someone else added a sensational (and fabricated) narrative to explain their origins. (Some versions of the message open with the statement \"This happened here, Columbus, MS!!\" but that line appears to be a later addition to the text.)\nEither way, we can make a few general points about what's described here:\nIt isn't unusual for snakes (venomous or otherwise) to occasionally turn up in consumer products and packaging (or in the stores that sell them), particularly at outlets that vend imported produce or gardening and nursery supplies (although sometimes such discoveries are more likely attributable to pranksters than to Mother Nature).\nRoughly speaking, only about 5% of the snake species found in the U.S. are venomous, so the average encounter with a snake is unlikely to result in any harm to humans.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a 6-year-old child working as a coal miner.\nIt's no surprise to students of history that throughout the American Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, and up until the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, many children in the United States were allowed  or compelled  to spend long hours toiling at physically demanding, hazardous, and unhealthful jobs for marginal wages. As one history of The American Era of Child Labor described those circumstances:\nAmerican children worked in large numbers in mines, glass factories, textiles, agriculture, canneries, home industries, and as newsboys, messengers, bootblacks, and peddlers.\nThe lucky ones swept the trash and filth from city streets or stood for hours on street corners hawking newspapers. The less fortunate coughed constantly through 10-hour shifts in dark, damp coal mines or sweated to the point of dehydration while tending fiery glass-factory furnaces ... By and large, these child laborers were the sons and daughters of poor parents or recent immigrants who depended on their childrens meager wages to survive ... By 1911, more than two million American children under the age of 16 were working  many of them 12 hours or more, six days a week. Often they toiled in unhealthful and hazardous conditions; always for minuscule wages.\nYoung girls continued to work in mills, still in danger of slipping and losing a finger or a foot while standing on top of machines to change bobbins; or of being scalped if their hair got caught. And, as ever, after a day of bending over to pick bits of rock from coal, breaker boys were still stiff and in pain. If a breaker boy fell, he could still be smothered, or crushed, by huge piles of coal. And, when he turned 12, he would still be forced to go down into the mines and face the threat of cave-ins and explosions.\nA meme commonly seen on social media attempts to vividly demonstrate the realities of the child labor era by displaying a photograph of a very young child (variously described as being 6 or 8 years old) who was supposedly working as a coal miner in the early 20th century:\nAlthough this photograph might reflect some realities of the child labor era, it does not literally depict a very young coal miner.\nThe child seen here looks too young to have been working in a coal mine at all. But even if he were, boys that young were not put to work actually mining coal, a job too physically demanding for such small children. Rather, they would be assigned other tasks, most commonly serving as \"breaker boys\" who spent their days at the labor-intensive tasks of separating slate and other impurities from coal by hand:\nFor 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into \"clean\" coal bins.\nThe work performed by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only at the end of the working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.\nThe original photograph looks to be merely a posed picture of a young boy dressed up with some props  he's gripping a tool (a pickaxe) far too large for him to wield, sporting a luxury he couldn't afford (a pipe), and standing in what looks far more like a photo studio than anything remotely resembling the environs of a coal mine:\nIndeed, the Western Mining and Railroad Museum in Helper, Utah, where this photograph is displayed, confirmed to us that the picture was taken in a nearby studio and does not depict a child coal miner:\nAccording to what we have, [this picture] was taken in a studio in Castle Gate, just outside of Helper, Utah. This is our most commented-on photograph in the museum, [and] it is interesting to see the wide range of reactions [it elicits], from amused to horrified. When visitors ask, I tell them this boy was not actually working in the mines, that [the photograph was] made in a studio. I tell them children did not work [as miners], although there is some reality to it, as the kids did go to work with their fathers [at the mines] at a young -- although not that young -- age. We have a display about what children did at the mines and child labor laws that I direct [visitors] to.\nIn sum, children did account for much of the labor force in mines in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with boys as young as 8 put to work in the countrys many coal mines under grueling and dangerous conditions. But although the photograph seen above is from that era and reflective of its characteristics in a broad sense, it's merely a \"cute\" staged picture of a little boy dressed up with props and not a genuine snapshot of a child coal miner.",

The conservative radio personality died after battling lung cancer.\nThe ad in question featured a photograph of Limbaugh and read: \"[Photos] Rush Limbaugh's Final Net Worth Left His Family In Tears.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a slideshow article with 254 pages. Each page featured a celebrity and his or her purported net worth.\nWe clicked through the entire story. It wasn't surprising to us that Limbaugh never showed up on any of the 254 pages. The article didn't mention his name even once. The ad was nothing more than clickbait.\nAside from the ad, the article seemed less than trustworthy. For example, Parker Schnabel of the \"Gold Rush\" reality TV series was featured on three different pages. Two pages claimed he was worth $8 million, while a third page said the figure was $10 million.\nAccording to the story, former TV news personality Megyn Kelly was purportedly worth both $30 million and $55 million at the same time, an incredible feat.\nNear the end of the story, actress Milana Vayntrub was featured on page 250. She is best known in her role as Lily Adams on AT&T television commercials and has been featured in the past in misleading advertisements.\nThe final page featured Monica Lewinsky, who previously was the target of a similar ad.\nAside from lengthy articles like this one, some readers might often find net worth dollar figures that appear above Google searches. While these might be interesting for discussion, there's perhaps little data behind those numbers to support their accuracy.\nAs for Limbaugh's actual net worth, the real figure was not made public. A number of websites have mentioned an amount of around $600 million. However, several of those websites all cited the same source for the figure. That single source only publishes estimates.\nIn sum, Limbaugh's net worth did not leave his family in tears. We've seen the same \"net worth left his family in tears\" trope for former \"Jeopardy\" host Alex Trebek and a number of other celebrities. All of those stories have been rated \"False.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

Here is an excerpt:\nTrumps older sister is not happy about the behavior of her little brother, the President of the United States.\nMaryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trumps older sister and a United States Circuit Judge, told reporters over the weekend, Donnies not acting right. \nThe 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.\nI dont recognize the Donnie whos in the White House right now, added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.\nDonnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him Donnie Dimwit. But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and thats not good for the country.\nAlthough Trump does have two older sisters, one of whom is inactive Senior Circuit Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, apart from reportedly likening him to P.T. Barnum on a past occasion she has not been known to criticize her brother Donald in public  and certainly has said nothing on the order of the disparaging statements attributed to her in this article.\nThe spoof was apparently inspired by the release of the Michael Wolff expos Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which asserts that some of President Trump's own aides question the 71-year-old's mental stability and competence. The provenance and accuracy of some of Wolff's claims have been questioned by other journalists.\nHis fitness for office has been defended by White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who called him an \"incredibly strong and good leader,\" and by Trump himself, who issued a tweet saying he qualifies as a genius, \"and a very stable genius at that!\"\nWhite House physician Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson conducted a cognitive assessment of Trump during the presidents's annual medical exam and said he did \"exceedingly well,\" scoring 30 out of 30 on a test designed to detect mild cognitive impairment. \"I find no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process,\" Jackson said during a 16 January White House press conference.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Donald Trumps inaugural committee spent more than $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the nations capital as part of a scheme to grossly overpay for party space and enrich the presidents own family in the process, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\nThe District of Columbias attorney general, Karl Racine, said the committee misused nonprofit funds and coordinated with the hotels management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. He said one of the events planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, the presidents daughter Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates, a top campaign official at the time.\nDistrict law requires nonprofits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies, Racine said. In this case, we are seeking to recover the nonprofit funds that were improperly funneled directly to the Trump family business.\nIt was the latest allegation that Trump and his family have used public and nonprofit funds spent at Trump-owned properties to enrich themselves  part of the peril of Trump not fully withdrawing from his businesses while he is president. Trump has maintained ownership but turned the reins over to his adult sons, who have bristled at the charge that they are profiting off their fathers presidency.\nThe committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trumps inauguration in January 2017. But the committees spending has drawn mounting scrutiny.\nThe inaugural committee said Wednesday that it cooperated with the investigation and that Racines office hadnt contacted its lawyers to interview any employees. A spokesman for the committee also said the group had not been contacted by the attorney generals office since last summer and suggested the timing of the suit was politically motivated, as the Senate impeachment trial of the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress was underway.\nThe facts will show that the PIC operated in compliance with the law and this suit is without merit. In fact, it reads more like a partisan press release than a legal filing, according to a committee statement.\nProsecutors found that Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who flipped on the president during the special counsels Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms. In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was a bit worried about the optics of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said.\nStephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump who played a leading role organizing the inaugural parties, had also told Trump, when he was president-elect, and Ivanka Trump that she was uneasy with the offer, Racine said. Winston Wolkoff later followed up with an email to Gates and Ivanka Trump warning that the hotels proposal was at least twice the market rate, Racine said.\nBut Gates went through with it anyway, at a cost of $1.03 million, the suit says.\nProsecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didnt consider those options.\nGates pleaded guilty to charges tied to his lucrative political consulting work in Ukraine and was sentenced last month to 45 days in prison, a punishment that a judge said reflected the extensive cooperation Gates had provided to the Justice Department. Racines office said investigators did not directly speak with Gates in as they pursued the suit.\nA lawyer who represented Gates for the criminal proceedings didnt immediately return a message seeking comment. The White House didnt immediately return a message nor did the Trump Organization.\nThe suit contends that the hotel went against industry practice and refused to discount the space, and double-booked its largest ballroom with a different organization that was still affiliated with the inauguration, the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast. Both organizations were nonprofits, but the breakfast paid $5,000 for the ballroom. The committee, however, paid $175,000, the suit claims.\nProsecutors say the committee also used nonprofit funds to throw a private party on Jan. 20 2017, the night of the inauguration, for Trumps family  a $300,000 affair. The reception was for three of Trumps children  Donald, Jr., Ivanka and Eric.\nThere will be an after party at the OPO (Trump Hotel) following the inaugural balls on Friday. DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric, Gates wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump, according to the suit. DJT is a reference to Donald J. Trump.\nEvent staff within the inaugural committee recognized this would not be a proper use of committee funds and had tried to cancel this event, according to the suit, but Gates and the Trump family went ahead anyway.\nRacine said his office focused on the inaugural committee and the companies that profited because investigators believe thats the best option for them to possibly recover the funds.\nRacine had been sending subpoenas for months related to the investigation. The inaugural committee was also being investigated by New York and state authorities in New Jersey, who are looking into, among other things, whether foreigners illegally contributed to the inaugural events.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the inauguration was held on Jan. 20, 2017.",

The photograph seen here shows debris resulting from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake (and resulting tsunami) that struck northern Japan in 2011:\nAn aerial view of damage to Wakuya, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area in northern Japan. Ships and aircraft from the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group are conducting search and rescue operations and re-supply missions as directed in support of Operation Tomodachi throughout northern Japan.\nFurthermore, National Geographic reported that while the name \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" may conjure up an image of a floating island of debris, the actual garbage patch itself was actually difficult to see:\nFor many people, the idea of a garbage patch conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics cant always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesnt show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes. The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nThe claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers \"8.1 percent of the Pacific Ocean\" is also a matter of debate. The number appeared to come from a 2008 quote from Marcus Eriksen, the research director at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation:\n\"Charles Moore, an American oceanographer who discovered the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" or \"trash vortex\", believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region. Marcus Eriksen, a research director of the US-based Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which Mr Moore founded, said: \"The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on. It is not quite like that. It is almost like a plastic soup. It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States.\"\nA 2011 study from Oregon State University, however, asserted that the real size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was hundreds of times smaller than commonly claimed:\nThere is a lot of plastic trash floating in the Pacific Ocean, but claims that the \"Great Garbage Patch\" between California and Japan is twice the size of Texas are grossly exaggerated, according to an analysis by an Oregon State University scientist.\nFurther claims that the oceans are filled with more plastic than plankton, and that the patch has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950s are equally misleading, pointed out Angelicque \"Angel\" White, an assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State.\n\"There is no doubt that the amount of plastic in the world's oceans is troubling, but this kind of exaggeration undermines the credibility of scientists,\" White said. \"We have data that allow us to make reasonable estimates; we dont need the hyperbole. Given the observed concentration of plastic in the North Pacific, it is simply inaccurate to state that plastic outweighs plankton, or that we have observed an exponential increase in plastic.\"\nThe studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically \"cohesive\" plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.\n\"The amount of plastic out there isn't trivial,\" White said. \"But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.\"\nBut a study published in 2018 stated the opposite of many of these assertions -- that the Pacific Ocean trash pile was much larger than previously reported and rapidly growing, that most of its bulk was larger objects rather than microplastics, and that about one-fifth of its volume came from the 2011 Japan earthquake referenced above:\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n\"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\nWhy the discrepancy? A variety of factors made it difficult to posit an accurate estimate of the debris field's true scope in earlier surveys:\nNo one knows for how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortexs area nearly impossible to measure.",

It was originally presented as a reproduction of a newspaper editorial harshly critical of those who had voted for Obama in 2008, one supposedly published in \"the Prague newspaper, Prager Zeitungon.\" That mention appeared to be a misspelled reference to Prager Zeitung (\"Prague Newspaper\"), a German-language weekly newspaper from the Czech Republic which is also circulated in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Later versions of this same item attributed that editorial to Vclav Klaus, a Czech politician who served as the first prime minister of an independent Czech Republic from 1993 to 1998 and then as the second President of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013.\nThe attributions of both publication and author were unverifiable, however. The initial version of this item (which was circulated at least as far back as April 2009) provided no contextual information such as a publication date or headline that would facilitate verification of its publication in Prager Zeitung. A search of that newspaper's website at that time pulled up only one article that mentioned Barack Obama, and that article included only an incidental reference about the level of security provided to a U.S. president. No evidence documented that this editorial had been published in either the print or online version of the Prager Zeitung.\nMoreover, not only did no evidence exist showing that Vclav Klaus penned this editorial, it was exceedingly unlikely that he would have written anything like it. Vclav Klaus and Barack Obama appeared to have a reasonably good working relationship while both were in office, and Klaus had not been otherwise been recorded as writing or saying anything (in public or private) nearly so harshly critical of President Obama as the editorial attributed to him here.\nMarcus Hundt, the editor-in-chief of Prager Zeitung, confirmed that the newspaper has never published such an article ... about Joe Biden nor about Barack Obama and that it primarily reports on events in the Czech Republic and Europe and not on domestic affairs in other counties.",

Many of the baseless claims associated with the caravan centered on the idea that the group was violent and posed an immediate threat to American citizens. For example, one image shared on social media purportedly showed members of this caravan dragging a Mexican official through the streets:\nAs usual, this photograph was not connected to the caravan of asylum seekers traveling toward the United States in October 2018 and originated in a different time and place. This picture was actually taken in November 2014 and related to violent protests in Acapulco, Mexico, over the disappearance of 43 students.\nThis photograph was shot by Pedro Pardo and is available via Getty Images, where it is posted with the following caption:\nDemonstrators hold a riot police during clashes following a protest against the suspected massacre of 43 missing students, near the airport in Acapulco, in the Mexican state of Guerrero State, on November 10, 2014. Protesters angry at the suspected massacre threw stones and a firebomb at riot police in the Pacific resort of Acapulco on Monday, injuring 11 officers. Around 300 students, some wearing masks and armed with sticks and machetes, were joined by some parents of the 43 missing young men as they marched toward the city's airport, but police blocked their way. Mexico was confronted with one of the grisliest massacres in years of drug violence after gang suspects confessed to slaughtering 43 missing students and dumping their charcoaled remains in a river.\nA November 2014 news report from The Guardian provides some context to the protests associated with this photograph:\nThe disappearance of the students had already sparked numerous peaceful demonstrations punctuated by the occasional outbreak of violence.\nTension has intensified, however, since the announcement by attorney general Jess Murillo that a large group of young people were massacred in a rubbish tip near Iguala a few hours after the students were arrested. He said that the victims were then burned on a huge pyre for 14 hours, making identification of the remains recovered by the authorities very difficult.\nThe parents have accused the government of trying to close down the case.\nPrior to the announcement of the massacre, the authorities had said they recovered at least 38 bodies from nine mass graves near Iguala. Attorney general Murillo said four of these have now been identified as people who disappeared at checkpoints set up by Guerreros Unidos gang members and the municipal police.",

While a few odd coincidences exist, Simpsons prediction hoaxes may outnumber actual Simpsons predictions.\nFor example, \"The Simpsons\" did not predict that U.S. President Donald Trump would ride down an escalator while announcing his bid for president; Lady Gaga's Superbowl halftime show; the video game Pokemon Go; the fire at Notre Dame cathedral; a mass shooting during a screening of \"Black Panther\"; Trump's touching a glowing orb; or Trump's death.\nIn August 2019, after Trump mulled the idea of buying Greenland and then announced that he was canceling a trip to the area after Denmark's prime minister rejected the idea, another Simpsons \"prediction\" started to circulate on social media.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a message on Twitter about how the animated show had predicted the kerfuffle.\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow made a similar joke on Twitter:\nWhile these tweets were likely posted in jest, some people didn't quite get the joke. At least two threads were started on \"The Simpsons\" section of Reddit asking if the prediction was real, and multiple people chimed in on Twitter about the show's uncanny ability to tell the future. Murphy's tweet was also shared on Fark as proof that \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening had a time machine.\nWe searched Frinkiac, a website named after the Simpsons' bumbling mad-scientist character Professor Frink. The site allows fans to search the show's archives for favorite quotes and jokes. And nothing surfaced for mentions of the words \"Greenland,\" \"Trump,\" and \"Denmark\" together.\nFurthermore, we've previously covered the show's \"predictions\" about Trump's presidency. And as far as we can tell, the first mention of a \"President Trump\" came during the season 11 episode, \"Bart to the Future,\" in 2000. Trump was mentioned in prior seasons, but never as president or a potential buyer of Greenland:",

The Conway clip was gleaned from a 22 January 2017 Meet the Press interview with Chuck Todd. While Todd was taken aback by Conway's comment, his reaction to it was not to succumb to an uncontrollable fit of the giggles:\nCHUCK TODD: (...) answer the question of why the president asked the White House press secretary to come out in front of the podium for the first time and utter a falsehood? Why did he do that? It undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office ...\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: No it doesn't.\nCHUCK TODD: ... on day one.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What ... you're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that. But the point remains ...\nCHUCK TODD: Wait a minute.

        "content": "However grim and difficult life these days is, Id still prefer to be sitting on dry land in lockdown than trying to do a three-point turn on the Suez canal with a 400-metre cargo ship under my control. Wouldnt you? The grounding of the Ever Given container vessel in the Suez canal has provoked both hilarity and genuine concern. Vessels have got stuck before in the canal: at its narrowest, the ditch in the desert, as crew on the container vessel I travelled with in 2010 told me, is only 300 metres wide. Its tight. Thats why ships must wait at either end to be sent through in a slow convoy. But the Ever Given is longer than the canal is wide, and it is stuck sideways. A simple shunt off the banks will not work.\nThe blockage is costly in all sorts of ways, as well as embarrassing for the Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine, the company that operates the ship. The Suez canal was opened in 1869, after the French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps employed forced labour to improve rudimentary pre-existing canals (that had been in existence probably since the time of Pharaoh Senusret III) and created an essential thoroughfare for marine traffic, expending many lives in the process and taking 10 years.\nTransiting the canal saves ships more than a week and many fuel costs compared with the longer route via the Cape of Good Hope. The canal is a huge money-spinner for the Egyptian government, earning it several billion dollars a year. When I went through on Maersk Kendal in 2010, as research for a book I wrote about the shipping industry, the transit cost $300,000. That fee included 14 hours of sedate trundling down what is actually rather a dull canal, once youve had an hour or so of excitement at seeing sand and palm trees, and realise youve got 13 more hours of them to go. It also included an obligatory Suez crew, who joined for the transit and had their own cabin, and a pilot who took control of the ship. This is standard procedure in modern shipping: ships often take on pilots in harbour areas or tricky passages because they have better local knowledge. Technically the pilot took command of the bridge, though the pilot we had was too busy eating his way through the entire menu, and dozing, to be particularly commanding. The second officer had to keep waking him up for instructions.\nAlthough the official reason given so far for the Ever Givens plight is that it was blown sideways by wind, I do wonder. In the vast majority of maritime accidents, human error is at fault. And no wonder: seafarers, working in ever smaller crews on ever larger ships, are knackered. Most on my journey were old enough to remember when they could stop for lunch in port. Now, ships are rarely in port for more than several hours, and those are busy. As we entered the canal, transiting south with our mostly empty boxes to collect made-in-China consumables and essentials such as medicine, the second officer was operating on three nights of three hours sleep, and would have no sleep during the transit. There is, as the Ever Given demonstrates, much to look out for during the passage.\nI think of those tired workers often, when I read about crew who have been stuck on their ships for the entire pandemic, forbidden from setting foot ashore, unable to go home. Even 10 years ago, the Filipino crew I sailed with called their job dollar for homesickness. So among the jokes and references to beached whales, I think of the crews on the 150 ships stuck behind and ahead of the Ever Given.\nOver the years, ships have been getting bigger and bigger, the better to bring us 90% percent of world trade  even if most people probably think that their breakfast cereal and electronics and clothes and fish arrive by air. In fact, modern shipping is so efficient, its cheaper to send Scottish fish to be filleted in China and back again than it would be to do the filleting at home. But that efficiency comes at a price: of ships reliant on this one waterway to get to the bounties of Asia, and of crews who spend months away from home, missing the births and birthdays of their children, to bring us what we need, and what we think we need.",

        "date": "2021-03-29T20:42:20",
        "content": "SUEZ, Egypt (AP)  Salvage teams on Monday finally freed the colossal container ship stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal, ending a crisis that had clogged one of the worlds most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.\nA flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of the skyscraper-sized Ever Given from the canals sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged since March 23.\nThe tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule.\nWe pulled it off! said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired to extract the Ever Given. I am excited to announce that our team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated the Ever Given  thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again.\nNavigation in the canal resumed at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT, noon EDT) said Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal Authority, adding that the first ships that were moving carried livestock. From the city of Suez, ships stacked with containers could be seen exiting the canal into the Red Sea.\nAt least 113 of over 420 vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed are expected to cross the canal by Tuesday morning, Rabei added at a news conference.\nAnalysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end.\nThe Ever Given sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, for inspection, said Evergreen Marine Corp., a Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship.\nBuffeted by a sandstorm, the Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That created a massive traffic jam that held up $9 billion a day in global trade and strained supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic.\nRabei said an investigation would determine why the Ever Given got stuck, and he estimated daily losses to the canal of between $12 million to $15 million.\nThe Suez Canal is not guilty of what happened. We are the ones who suffered damage. he said.\nAt least 367 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, had backed up to wait to traverse the canal. Dozens of others have taken the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africas southern tip  a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.\nThe canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Mondays events after days of silence about the blockage.\nEgyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis, he wrote on Facebook, despite the massive technical complexity.\nIn the village of Amer, which overlooks the canal, residents cheered as the vessel moved along. Many scrambled to get a closer look while others mockingly waved goodbye to the departing ship from their fields of clover\nMission accomplished, villager Abdalla Ramadan said. The whole world is relieved.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Cairo tweeted its congratulations to Egypt.\nThe breakthrough followed days of immense effort with an elite salvage team from the Netherlands. Tugboats pushed and pulled to budge the behemoth from the shore, their work buoyed by high tide at dawn Monday that led to the vessels partial refloating. Specialized dredgers dug out the stern and vacuumed sand and mud from beneath the bow.\nThe operation was extremely delicate. While the Ever Given was stuck, the rising and falling tides put stress on the vessel, which is 400 meters (a quarter mile) long, raising concerns it could crack.\nRabei praised the team, saying they achieved a very difficult mission in record time, without damaging the vessel or its cargo.\nBerdowski told Dutch radio station NPO 1 the company had always believed it would be the two powerful tugboats it sent that would free the ship. Mondays strong tide helped push the ship at the top while we pulled at the bottom and luckily it shot free, he said.\nWe were helped enormously by the strong falling tide we had this afternoon. In effect, you have the forces of nature pushing hard with you and they pushed harder than the two sea tugs could pull, Berdowski added.\nThe crew on the tugs was euphoric, but there also was a tense moment when the huge ship was floating free so then you have to get it under control very quickly with the tugs around it so that it doesnt push itself back into the other side of the canal, he said.\nJubilant workers on a tugboat sailing with the Ever Given chanted, Mashhour, No. 1, referring to the dredger that worked around the vessel. The dredger is named for Mashhour Ahmed Mashhour, assigned to run the canal with others when it was nationalized in 1956 by President Gamal Abdel-Nasser.\nOnce the Ever Given is inspected in Great Bitter Lake, officials will decide whether the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship hauling goods from Asia to Europe would continue to its original destination of Rotterdam or head to another port for repairs.\nThe crisis cast a spotlight on the vital trade route that carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the worlds oil. Over 19,000 ships ferrying Chinese-made consumer goods and millions of barrels of oil and liquified natural gas flow through the artery from the Middle East and Asia to Europe and North America.\nThe unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, has prompted new questions about the shipping industry, an on-demand supplier for a world under pressure from the pandemic.\nWeve gone to this fragile, just-in-time shipping that we saw absolutely break down in the beginning of COVID, said Capt. John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com. We used to have big, fat warehouses in all the countries where the factories pulled supplies.  Now these floating ships are the warehouse.\nInternational trade expert Jeffrey Bergstrand predicted only a minor and transitory effect on prices of U.S. imports.\nSince most of the imports blocked over the last week are heading to Europe, U.S. consumers will likely see little effect on prices of U.S. imports, except to the extent that intermediate products of U.S. final goods are made in Europe, said Bergstrand, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dames Mendoza College of Business.\n__\nDeBre reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

The man shown in the meme was born without arms and is not a veteran. Trump himself amplified the incorrect, debunked claim on Twitter.\nFull Story\nPresident Donald Trump can be seen in a viral image touching the face of a supporter with prosthetic arms  a moment that occurred during a campaign rally in early 2016.\nA purported story attached to that image, however, is incorrect.\nRadio personality Mark Simone, a Trump supporter, tweeted the photo on Sept. 4, claiming, I remember when President Trump met a veteran wounded so badly that he had no arms. The President reached out and touched his face so he would feel the human contact.\nThat story is wrong  and while Simone has shared it since 2017, fact checkers at Snopes debunked it a year ago.\nSimones recent tweet was then retweeted by Trump, who thanked Simone, and has been turned into a meme condemning the media that has been widely viewed on Instagram accounts such as republicansmovement and donaldtrump_2020.\nThe claim is being shared anew in the aftermath of a story in The Atlantic that quoted unnamed sources alleging that Trump made disparaging comments about wounded veterans and fallen soldiers. Other outlets have also reported corroborating parts of The Atlantics story, but Trump has denied the claims.\nSimone in a Facebook post, sharing the photo of Trump greeting the supporter, urged his followers not to fall for the Atlantic Magazine hoax.\nA reverse image search of the photo in question brought us to 2016 stories referring to a Trump campaign video about veterans that used the image.\nIt was actually taken at a rally at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina  and it shows Trump interacting with a supporter, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr.\nThe Chester News & Reporter published photos and an account of the meeting  during which Trump signed one of Stevensons prosthetic arms.\nChester News & Reporter, Jan. 19, 2016: Stevenson said Trump came over to him after his speech, asked how he was doing and how he got injured. He told Trump that he was born without arms.\nTrump signed Stevensons arm, a sign and his hat.\nIt is my first tattoo on my arm, Stevenson joked.\nLocal news reports in 2014 had covered an online fundraising campaign by Stevensons family to collect donations in order to buy a bionic arm. He and his mother relayed then, too, that he was born in 1991 without arms.\nNone of the stories reported on military service.\nWe reached out to Stevenson, but didnt hear back.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Joe Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's atrocities against its Uyghur population as the result of \"different norms.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2021, some news outlets accused U.S. President Joe Biden of making \"horrific excuses\" for China's atrocities against its Uyghur population.\nFor example, a New York Post headline dated Feb. 17, 2021, reported, \"Biden dismisses Uighur genocide as part of Chinas 'different norms.'\" The Post reported:\n\"President Biden is dismissing the genocide against the Uighur population in China, dubbing the mass internment a 'different norm'  despite the State Department this month responding to atrocities in the camps, following reports of systemic rape and torture.\"\nThe Post's editors followed this story up with an editorial claiming Biden had made \"horrific excuses\" for the Chinese government's human rights abuses.\nThis characterization of Biden's comments during the CNN town hall was misleading.\nThe remark in question came during a Feb. 16, 2021, presidential town hall held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. During the town hall, Cooper asked Biden whether he had brought up the Chinese government's human rights abuses, namely against its Uyghur population, in his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nBiden didn't say that cultural differences are a justification for China's atrocities against Uyghurs  instead, his meaning appeared to be the opposite of that. Biden stated that Xi implicitly understood he or any U.S. president would be expected to take a position against human rights abuses by the Chinese government. Here is a transcript of full the exchange between Cooper and Biden, with the key portion bolded:\nMR. COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We must speak up for human rights. Its who we are. We cant  my comment to him was  and I know him well, and he knows me well. Were  a two-hour conversation.\nMR. COOPER: You talked about this to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I talked about this, too. And thats not so much refugee, but I talked about  I said  look, you know, Chinese leaders  if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been  the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they havent been unified at home. So the central  to vastly overstate it  the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.\nI point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea Im not going to speak out against what hes doing in Hong Kong, what hes doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful  I said  and by the  he said he  he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they  their leaders  are expected to follow.\nLater Biden indicated that Xi knew that human rights abuses by the Chinese government would result in consequences:\nMR. COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just  is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What Im doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other  other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.\nWe reached out to the White House asking for clarification on Biden's remark.\nKedenard Raymond, director of communications for the National Security Council, wrote in an emailed statement to Snopes that Biden's comment conveyed the expectation that an American president will speak out against human rights abuses:\nPresident Biden has called the oppression of the Uyghurs a genocide, and he stands against it in the strongest possible terms. In that statement, the President was speaking about the need for U.S. Presidents to speak out on universal values, which are deeply held by Americans, and about human dignity everywhere. If you look at the preceding statement, the President stated: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. As he has said publicly and in the initial rounds of calls he has made to leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China, U.S. Presidents are expected to reflect the American norms and values of advocating for human rights.",

The mega-retailer will double in size and has already begun the liquidation process of Ulta products. To date, 18 of the 950 Ulta stores have already closed. The remaining stores will close by the end of the year.\nSome of you may be sad to see your local Ulta Beauty close down, but the rest of you are probably wondering:\"Will this benefit me in any way?\" The answer to that question is absolutely \"YES!\" On top of the final blowout sales that are going to be held at each of the closing locations, Ulta Beauty cosmetics department is offering FREE SAMPLES of their skin care products..\nThe scam advertisement then claimed that Ulta carries a secret product reserved only for celebrities and other high rollers, but now accessible to all due to the (nonexistent) liquidation of their products thanks to the (nonexistent) buyout:\nUntil recently, Ulta Beauty has always kept an amazing wrinkle secret called Vlamorous Cream reserved for their high paying celebrity clients. They reported that in order to clear the products off the shelves, they needed to give out free samples for everyone to try. As a result, a few weeks ago they shared the simple solution previously only shared with celeb clients to everyone!\nVisitors to the fake People site were greeted by a landing page that resembles the magazine's digital counterpart, complete with invitations to subscribe and a portal to other magazine titles. Clicking the links to other magazines leads to more scam sales pages:\nAttempts to close the page causes a window to pop up with information about a \"free trial\" with dwindling supplies. The page is not published by People, it does not report real news, and it serves only to convert traffic into sales for a skincare product it falsely claims was a long-kept secret at Ulta.",

Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one  or more!  of CJ Trinidads shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

        "content": "I have received a query from you regarding the file called \"Metlholo\" that has been circulated around and causing fears. The file contains photos of a group of people dissected a corspe in an open field. For your perusal, I would like to send herewith the facts regarding the abovementioned photos as follows:\nThe photos were taken on 13 March 2009 at a cemetery in a southwestern province of Thailand (Prachaub Khiri Khan Province). For people who practice Buddhism in Thailand, there are two religious rituals to honour the deceased: the first is to cremate the body, and the second is to bury the body. For Buddhists in Thailand, the burial of the deceased is not as widely-practiced as cremation. Buddhists are normally buried rather than cremated when they have no relatives, or when their relatives cannot afford to pay for the cremation.\nCemeteries in rural provinces in Thailand often run out of space as a result of too many bodies being buried in limited amount of land. So the Buddhists in Thailand practice a religious tradition called \"Lang Pa Cha\" (which means \"the cleaning and tidying of the cemetery\"), where volunteers will dig up bodies that were unclaimed by any relatives and cremate them to honour their spirits in accordance with the Buddhist religious rites. Such a ritual is considered to be a good deed and a merit-making process.\nAt every \"Lang Pa Cha\" religious ritual, a large number of unclaimed bodies is always found. (In the case of the photos taken here, 64 unclaimed bodies were found.) To cremate a whole body takes a long time, so only the bones of the unclaimed bodies are cremated. Thus the reason for the dissection of the flesh from the bodies as you have seen in the photos.\nThe volunteers in this ritual are mostly medical staff or emergency response crews who are the first unit to arrive at accident scenes to save lives (easily identifiable by their blue-and-white uniforms and ID cards). They are used to seeing dead bodies, and that is why they look nonchalant in the photos.\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, the volunteers who participate in this religious ritual must be on a strictly vegetarian diet in order to cleanse their minds both before and after the ritual. The images of the volunteers cooking and having their lunch just show the preparation of a normal vegetarian lunch and have no connection to the deceased body or the dissected flesh.\nThe circulation of the images is thus an ill-intended attempt meant to mislead the public into believing that one race of human will commit genocide or inhuman acts against another and thus create fear and hatred. The deceased body shown in the photos is a Thai male with a dark complexion (which had been even darker after his death), not an African male.\nI hope this email provides you with factual information regarding this ill-intended document and photos.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows members of the National Guard turning their backs on U.S. President Joe Biden's motorcade.\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, there was a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. In the days that followed, as preparations were being made for the inauguration of President Joe Biden on Jan. 20, about 20,000 members of the National Guard were deployed to Washington, D.C., to provide security for the event.\nAs Biden's inauguration was underway, a video started circulating on social media that some, such as the conspiratorial InfoWars, claimed showed members of the National Guard intentionally turning their backs on Biden's motorcade as a sign of disrespect.\nThis video does not show members of the National Guard intentionally turning their backs on Biden's motorcade.\nThe claim that these National Guardsmen were turning their backs on Biden's motorcade is based on the presumption that members of the military should, at all times, stand at attention in the presence of the commander-in-chief. But that's not the case. In this video, for instance, these members of the United States military are on duty to protect the president against potential threats. In order to do so, some are facing away from the street, while others are facing toward the motorcade.\nA spokesperson for the National Guard told us: These National Guardsmen were on duty with a mission to protect the president against potential threats. Some are facing out to ensure the safety of all.\nIn other words, this video does not show any disrespectful behavior. The National Guardsmen in this video were simply performing their duties to ensure the safety of everyone in attendance at Biden's inauguration.\nThe claim that this video shows members of the military turning their backs on the president is based on solely on the thirdhand interpretations of social media users. No members of the National Guard have stated that they turned their backs on the motorcade, no credible news outlets have filed such reports, nor has the National Guard released any statements admonishing members of the military for showcasing disrespect for their commander-in-chief.\nIt should also be noted that Biden's motorcade consisted of dozens of vehicles. While we don't have a precise count, the automotive news site The Drive described the motorcade as \"absolutely massive,\" consisting of seven \"Beasts,\" the nickname for the heavily armored presidential limo, to transport Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George Bush. Several other SUVs, limos, and police and military escort vehicles were also in the motorcade.\nAn absolutely massive motorcade took President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, along with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, among others, around the greater Washington, D.C. area after the inauguration today. At one point, at least seven heavily armored and otherwise custom-built presidential limousines, commonly known as \"Beasts,\" together with an armada of other armored SUV limousines and supporting vehicles, took part in the procession.\nLastly, while the vantage point of this video is still a bit unclear, it certainly did not originate from Biden's vehicle. This video was posted by ABC News reporter Ines de La Cuetara, along with the caption: \"The view from Bidens motorcade as it made its way up to the Capitol.\" La Cuetara, who was presumably in a vehicle near the rear of the motorcade  as she is a reporter, not a politician  made no mention of the National Guard turning their backs on Biden.\nHere's the original video:",

        "content": "Claim:\nThe Missouri state government issued \"[N-word] hunting\" licenses.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2014, photos of a \"[N-word] hunting\" license circulated on social media sites, often accompanied by a message claiming the license had been issued by the state of Missouri:\nThe pictured license was not issued by the state of Missouri, nor did it provide the holder the legal right to hunt and kill African-Americans. It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall? Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isnt playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials emphatic insistence that theyll never cough up the dough.\nBecause nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that, the billionaire businessman added. We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. Thats how I know theyre bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, Im going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when Im done building it, Im going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteens Born In The USA to them, just for the hell of it. You just dont mess with the U.S., and thats that ... Let me tell you, weve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think thats a pretty definitive message, and thats the hard way. Now, Ive said before that political correctness is whats killing this country, and Im standing by it. However, since Ive never been a warmonger, Im trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, well have no problem. If they dont and they start acting up, well, well just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.\nComments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from an MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:\nOn MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\nTrust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn't playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday.\nOne of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials' emphatic insistence that they'll never cough up the dough.\nMexican President Pea Nieto blasted Trump in two separate interviews this week, slamming the billionaire's strident expressions to a Mexico City newspaper and warning that the kind of rhetoric he uses has led to very fateful scenes in the history of humanity.\nThat's the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived, Pea Nieto said. Trump's comments, he told El Universal, have \"hurt the relationship we have sought with the United States.\"\nThe first portion of the article may have led readers to think that the subsequent claims were real, but everything beyond its first paragraph was fabricated. Content published by the self-styled \"hybrid\" news sites Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo built upon controversial current events with related embellishments. Politicalo and related sites featured a button enabling readers to \"Show Facts\" or \"Hide Facts\":\nHowever, every Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo item opened in \"Hide Facts\" mode by default, making the embellishments difficult for readers to identify. In addition to its \"Show Facts/Hide Facts\" feature, Politicalo's disclaimer explained:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nPrevious Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo articles that caused social media confusion included claims that Marco Rubio said women should be taken into custody if they were considering an abortion (and that Zika was a punishment from God), Pat Robertson said gay people should wear colors by which heterosexual people could identify them in public, Pastor John Piper said bikini waxes were a sin in the eyes of God, David Bowie was alive but held hostage by Satanic entities, Ted Cruz said God would not have allowed Antonin Scalia to die at a time that was not politically expedient, a Republican lawmaker proposed saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for food stamp recipients, and Bristol Palin said that more black actors weren't nominated for Oscars because they all looked alike.",

This message was wrong on both accounts.\nThe artwork shown above was created by Friedrich Kunath in 2010 for a solo exhibition at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York, making the work not amateur, not the winner of a contest, and not from the Netherlands. Additionally, Kunath's art (which is called \"Tropical Depression\"), has nothing at all to do with Europe or multiculturalism:\nTropical Depression refers to a kind of internal weather system combining melancholy and a sense of hopefulness. Tropical Depression is a lush depression one wallows in and holds in itself a kind of promise and optimism.\n[...]\nEach of the sculptures are a combination of realistic figuration and the surreal. Life scale and wearing the artist's clothes, the sculptures possess an uncanny presence. Each of the sculptures' titles begin with the phrase \"All my problems are water based . . .\" evoking ongoing themes in Kunath's work of homesickness, melancholia, and addiction. The line between nurturing and excess become blurred with images of a man engorging himself on a giant strawberry or watering a tree connected to a noose.\nWhile viewers are free to interpret artwork any way they choose, the artist's original intent was not to represent multiculturalism in Europe.",

This isnt how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? Its not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didnt have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasnt replaced because a process wasnt codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobarts absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldnt become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but thats for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows police officers attempting to arrest an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\nAs protests erupted across the United States in May 2020 after the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers, the internet was flooded with videos and photographs showing the sometimes chaotic scene.\nWhile much of this media gave genuine glimpses of these protests, a number of miscaptioned pieces of footage also made their way into the mix. The following video, for instance, was viewed millions of times as it circulated along with the claim that it showed two officers in Minnesota attempting to arrest a black man only to find out that he was an FBI agent:\nThis video, however, does not show the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. On the contrary, this video reportedly shows a police \"encounter with [a] black male\" in Rochester, Minnesota, and is unrelated to the protests in 2020.\nThis video was originally posted to Instagram by @thisisnike1 on May 31:\nIts timing coincided with the Floyd protests, but the original post included a caption explaining that this incident had been filmed \"over a year\" ago and that it involved the Rochester Minnesota Police Department. The original caption made no mention of the person in this video being an FBI agent. A version posted to YouTube by this account identified the person simply as a \"black male\":\nSomethin been telling me to hold on to this video over a year now, ok. Some days we make it home or some days we make it 6 feet deep. Imagine getting killed at home, while jogging, playing, minding your own business or just damn breathing #BeingBlackInWhiteAmerica!! This incident happened a year ago. The Minnesota police department been corrupt. Cant even smoke a damn cigarette in peace.\nSoon after this video was posted, it was re-captioned and shared along with the claim that it showed the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. It's unclear where this rumor originated. The above-displayed video makes no mention of this person being an FBI agent and when his wallet is pulled out by the police officer it does not show an FBI badge.\nThis rumor may have started with @thisisnike1, the account that originally posted the video. A screenshot supposedly showing a deleted tweet shows a message from @thisisnike1 reading \"[he is an] FBI agent.\" This appears to have been a joke, however, as this account has retweeted a number of people explaining that this person was not actually an FBI agent:\nIn sum, this video was originally shared with a caption stating that this incident took place over a year earlier (i.e., in 2019, not 2020) and that it featured an encounter between police and an unidentified black male. There's nothing in the video or the original caption indicating that this person was an FBI agent.\nWe reached out to @thisisnike1 and will update this article if more information becomes available.",

By precooking it and blending it in a special way, he was able to make a fully cooked 100% bacon paste that could be squeezed from a tube. Knowing he had discovered something paradigm-shifting, young Vilhelm Lilleflsk quickly went into business. That, dear friends, is when Squeez Bacon was born. And this delicious delectable from Sweden has finally been brought over to the USA - now with American Flavor!\nBoth Squeez Bacon and Vilhelm Lilleflsk are made-up entities created for ThinkGeek's annual April Fools' Day fake product launch. A November 2009 New York Times Magazine piece referencing Squeez Bacon described that tradition, which began in 2001:\nOn April 1 of each year since 2001, ThinkGeek, the online retailer, has devoted its home page to products that dont exist. The names sound unlikely  Squeez Bacon, Surgestix Inhalable Caffeine Stix, p-Teqs USB Pregnancy Test Kit, etc.  but they are presented as any item on the site would be: catalog description and list of features, pictures, maybe a video, price, Buy Now button. Click that and . . . ThinkGeek wishes you a happy April Fools Day.\nAccording to an April 2, 2009, story on the website Bacon Today, this is the image people attempting to procure Squeez Bacon would have seen had they added the product to their cart:\nDespite the fact that ThinkGeek  a website famous for its fake April Fools' Day products  explicitly stated that the product was not real 12 years ago, there remains confusion online as to the feasibility of buying a tube of Squeez Bacon. A Jan. 30, 2021, Reddit post in the \"Thanks I Hate It\" subreddit brought renewed attention to the fake product.\nUnfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your viewpoint) the product remains fictional. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

Alden Ehrenreich stars as Solo, joined by a cast that includes Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Donald Glover, who appears as a young Lando Calrissian.\nThe trailer introduces many of the films major players, as well as Solos long-time partner-in-crime Chewbacca. As one might expect, theres plenty of evidence to back up Solos claim that he will become a pilot ... the best in the galaxy, with several action-heavy scenes of Han at the wheel of his starship the Millennium Falcon.\nLike the previous standalone instalment in the franchise, Rogue One, Solo has been beset by production troubles, with original directing duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller replaced midway through filming by Ron Howard. Despite this, the film is expected to be one of the years biggest box office hits.\nSolo: A Star Wars Story is scheduled to be released globally on 25 May 2018.",

It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

In January 2007, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California was sworn in as the Speaker of the House, the first woman to hold that position in the history of our nation. She is currently the House Minority Leader. We are delighted to have her with us. Nancy Pelosi, welcome to WAIT WAIT...DON'T TELL ME.\n(APPLAUSE)\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Thank you, Peter. Hi, everyone. It's great to be with you.\nLUKE BURBANK: We met once, but I don't expect you to remember it, because I was panhandling.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBURBANK: Let's not get bogged down.\nSAGAL: Let's clarify something right off the bat. How are we to address you? What is the protocol? Speaker Pelosi, in honor of your former position? Leader Pelosi, in honor of your current one?\nPELOSI: Because we're all such good friends here, just say Nancy.\nSAGAL: Just say Nancy. Nancy.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: It sounds good, though, Nancy. So we're delighted to have you with us. We found out, and it should be obvious, given your success in politics, that you grew up in a very political family. You were raised in the business.\nPELOSI: Right.\nSAGAL: Your father was the mayor of Baltimore.\nPELOSI: Yes, he was.\nSAGAL: Right. So what was it like growing up in a political household?\nPELOSI: Well, it was like campaigning, forever campaigns, all the time. There was never a time when we weren't walking precincts or receiving volunteers at the door to pick up their brochures, their buttons, their bumper stickers, their placards that would be called lawn signs these days. And I learned how to count votes.\nSAGAL: Did you really? So, like, other kids were counting blocks, you were like going \"one vote, two votes.\"\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: When you were a baby, were you kissing babies?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: We were reading about your father's career and your involvement with him, and we read that one of the jobs that you had working with your father was that you kept his favor file. Is that correct?\nPELOSI: No, I didn't keep it but I worked on it. That is, to say...\nSAGAL: What is it exactly?\nPELOSI: What it is, is that if somebody - for example, if someone came to the door and said they needed help in some way, if they needed help finding a job or something like that. The idea was, of the favor file was that when that person was on his or her feet then they would extend a helping hand to somebody else. In other words, they passed it on.\nSAGAL: Really?\nPELOSI: So where would you go to look for help for somebody else is someone that you had helped already.\nSAGAL: Right. Or if you needed to have someone killed...\nPELOSI: Again, it was a very...\nSAGAL: ...call upon this person.\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Do I detect an ethnic slur there?\nSAGAL: No, no.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: I wasn't at all thinking about that scene from \"The Godfather.\" I really wasn't.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCHARLIE PIERCE: Leader Pelosi, we have no idea who this guy is doing the interview.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: So, eventually you got married, you moved with your husband to San Francisco and you got involved with politics there. You ran for office yourself. You know, when you went into politics, you did it with a splash.\nOf course, you rose through the ranks of the Democratic Party in the House, and you became the Speaker of the House. You're our first Speaker of the House we've ever had on the show. We have a lot of questions about that. Primarily, what is it like to sit behind the president during the State of the Union address?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Is it hard to maintain a straight face?\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Well, I'm glad you're getting down to the truly important here...\nSAGAL: Yes.\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: ...Speaker of the House.\nSAGAL: No, really, I mean it must - because you know, like the nation is looking at the president and you are looming there over his shoulder. You could wreak havoc with the address if you wanted to, by making faces. Do you have to think about, like...\nPELOSI: Well, one could.\nSAGAL: Yes.\nPELOSI: Well, here's the thing...\nSAGAL: Yeah.\nPELOSI: ...the Speaker of the House has awesome power. And so when the joint session is called and the president of the United States is welcomed in a joint session, House and Senate, it is the Speaker of the House who introduces the president. Not that that's the power part, but it's a manifestation...\nSAGAL: That is power. You could keep him waiting. You could be standing, and he could be waiting outside. And you could be like, \"So guys, what's up?\"\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: See the game last night?\nPELOSI: Well, no, but, you know, but you would want to be respectful now wouldn't you? I mean, under other circumstances you would want to be respectful...\nSAGAL: Yeah.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: I want to ask a little bit about the job. Do you ever talk to the current Speaker, John Boehner? Does he ever call you up and go \"I don't know how I'm going to get this done; these guys are being so obstreperous. What do I do, Nancy?\" Does that ever happen?\nPELOSI: No.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Really, you don't...\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: He doesn't invite you over, back to your old office just for a get together, have a good cry, you and him and talk about problems.\nPELOSI: No.\nSAGAL: No, really, I mean...\nPELOSI: Girls don't cry.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: No. Well done.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFAITH SALIE: Nancy, I can't believe I just called you that. Thank you.\nPELOSI: Thank you, Faith. I'll call you Faith; you call me Nancy.\nSALIE: That's a deal. I earnestly want to ask you about an issue that's dear to my heart and I understand it's dear to yours, which is chocolate.\nPELOSI: Oh, yes.\nSAGAL: We've read this too that this is your great vice, if you will, you're big into chocolate.\nPELOSI: I don't consider it a vice. I consider it...\nSALIE: A blessing from God.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: You consider it...\nPELOSI: Very dark chocolate, very dark chocolate.\nSAGAL: Very dark. So tell us what you can. Tell us what you're willing to admit of your chocolate consumption.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBURBANK: Let's get down to brass tacks. How many pounds of chocolate have you eaten today?\n(LAUGHTER)\nBURBANK: I'll take that as 20.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Well, Nancy, Madam Speaker, we have invited you here to play a game we're calling?\nCARL KASELL: I'm a hero to my sex.\nSAGAL: You made history as the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. But we felt that women have been hogging the spotlight for too long.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: So we wanted to highlight some masculine pioneers. Answer three questions about men who dared to go where no man had gone before, and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, Carl's voice on their voicemail system. Carl, who is Speaker Pelosi playing for?\nKASELL: Nancy is playing for Tom and Libby Deichsel of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\nSAGAL: All right, are you ready to play?\nPELOSI: OK.\nSAGAL: All right, here's your first question. One organization has been the target of repeated legal action by men who want the right to do what? A: be surrogate mothers? B: be a waitress at Hooters? Or C: be Playboy Playmate of the Month?\nPELOSI: Waitress at Hooters.\nSAGAL: You're right, that's what it was.\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Hooters have been sued a number of times by men who claim it's sexist that the company will not hire them to put on skimpy shorts and very tight t-shirts, tied under the bosom and serve...\nPELOSI: Oh please, that's enough. That's enough.\nSAGAL: Oh.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Well, you're offended. You're allowed to do it, we are not.\n(LAUGHTER)\nPIERCE: I don't know if you noticed, Peter, but the big hammer just came down.\nSAGAL: It sure did.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: All right, that's good. That was very good. Here is your second question. Brad Pitt, movie star, recently struck a blow for male equality when he became the first man ever to star in a Chanel #5 TV ad. Usually it's a female movie star.\nIn the ad, he says which of these immortal lines? I'm going to quote Brad Pitt. Is it A: I am like a cave dwelling fish; I have no eyes, merely a nose, open to experiencing, you?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Or is it B: The world turns, and we turn with it. Plans disappear, dreams take over, but wherever I go, there you are? Or is it C: If you wear Chanel #5, a handsome movie star like me might find you attractive. Otherwise, no dice?\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Well I'm sure it's not number three.\nSAGAL: OK.\nPELOSI: I only hope it's not number one, so I have to go with number two.\nSAGAL: You are correct, that is...\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSALIE: Nice.\nSAGAL: ...the particular quote from Mr. Pitt. I have no idea what he means but it apparently has something to do with perfume. All right, last question. Just recently, 24-year-old Rob Wilson broke the glass ceiling or floor, as the case may be, when he became the first man ever to do what? A: Watch The Oprah Network.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: B: Be a demonstration model on \"The Price is Right\"? Or C: Date Donald Trump?\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Oh gosh. I think it's number two.\nSAGAL: You are correct, in fact.\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\nSALIE: Wow.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Auditioned, won an online poll and he became the first male model to appear demonstrating all the nice prizes on \"The Price is Right.\" Carl, how did Minority Leader Pelosi do?\nKASELL: Nancy, you had three correct answers, so you win for Tom and Libby Deichsel. Congratulations.\nSAGAL: Well done, another victory.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: I hope this triumph ranks right up there with the Affordable Care Act in terms of your personal resume.\nPELOSI: Well, I'm happy - Tom and Libby, I hope to meet you sometime. I hope that those were the answers that you would have chosen as well.\nBURBANK: I do, too because they would have lost otherwise.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Ms. Nancy Pelosi is the former Speaker of the House, currently the Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ms. Pelosi, thank you so much for being with us. What a pleasure to speak to you and good luck.\nPELOSI: Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Carl, Charlie, Faith and Luke and all of you. It was great fun to be with you.\nSALIE: Thank you.\nSAGAL: Thank you so much.\nPIERCE: Thank you.\nSAGAL: Bye-bye.\n(APPLAUSE)\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright  2012 NPR. All rights reserved.

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

It was taken from a set of images published on 23 September 2009 in a Daily Mail article titled \"Six Flags over Georgia theme park submerged in Atlanta floods,\" in which the photograph caption and article text reported the picture as showing:\nThe upper part of the Six Flags Over Georgia's main rollercoaster is visible through the flood waters of the Chattahoochee River. The Scream Machine ride, once the tallest rollercoaster in the world, is all that remains visible of the popular tourist attraction after waters from the nearby Chattahoochee River in Atlanta flooded into the park.\nVersions of this photograph circulated in January 2016 (and again in May 2017) hinged on contemporaneous flooding events in several states; among those affected were Georgia, Missouri, and Illinois:\nA rare winter flood that brought record or near-milestone crests along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, claiming at least 25 lives in Missouri and Illinois, has largely subsided in the region. However, the Illinois River continues to rise in some Illinois stretches.\nThe National Weather Service says that's the amount that deluged much of Missouri and portions of Illinois over a three-day period starting Dec. 26. The pounding proved epic in some areas: The 11.43 inches that pummeled Springfield, Missouri, in December broke the city's 1895 record for precipitation for that month. Hydrologists with the weather service say such drenches occur in the U.S. only every 100 to 300 years.\nWhile the regions cited in various versions of the rumor were affected by flooding, Six Flags Over Georgia reported no adverse events on their Twitter feed (but invited followers to visit for holiday events):\nHad the park been underwater, potential visitors likely would have been informed via the same means, but instead Six Flags Over St. Louis repudiated the rumor via their Twitter feed:",

        "content": "Claim:\nAn FBI field agent quietly warned a Missouri sheriff's department that a propane bomb attack is expected around Christmas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late November and early December 2015, rumors in Missouri held that the concurrent thefts of propane tanks and purchases of large quantities of prepaid cell phones indicated that a terrorist attack in the area was imminent.\nThe interlinked rumors began with a 30 November 2015 incident at a Walmart in Lebanon, Missouri, where police were summoned to investigate a report of unusual purchase activity involving electronics. Eleven days later, the local sheriff's office advised residents that the purchases in question were definitively unrelated to terrorism and simply involved the bulk buying and reselling of cell phones.\nAt the same time the cell phone rumor was circulating, many local residents and bloggers speculated that the purchases were somehow linked to the near-concurrent thefts of propane tanks from several nearby retail outlets. Due in part to fears exacerbated by the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, people surmised that an apparent pattern of unusual acquisitions was clear evidence that a similar terror incident was afoot.\nAn earlier article published on this site included a comment made by a retired FBI agent who maintained that propane tank theft was almost certainly unrelated to terrorist activity for many reasons:\nRetired FBI agent Michael Tabman says it is up to law enforcement to investigate and try to connect the dots.\n\"Certainly, we hear something about gas being stolen we worry about a potential bomb. The good news is this is probably not part of terrorist planning for a number of reasons,\" Tabman said.\n\"One is they wouldn't steal these items because they know that would attract law enforcement's attention. Also this would not be a tool of choice,\" he continued.\nConcerns about the cell phone purchases were put to bed by law enforcement on 11 December 2015, but a few days later the above-reproduced screenshot began circulating via Facebook:\nCandace I can't post this, my brother is with the Sheriff's Department and they were unofficially warned by an FBI field agent to advise every body that can to arm themselves and their families carry open if you don't have a CCW and be prepared for these propane tank bombs to be used against dams, bridges, and power distribution centers across the state. Expected target time is Christmas.\nThe warning bore many elements of contemporaneous rumors of similar nature, primarily ones holding that an anonymous individual from a local or federal law enforcement agency had quietly attempted to warn citizens of an upcoming attack by a spreading a rumor (rather than by formally warning residents through credible means). A post-Paris warning regarding New York City held that the city's subway system was similarly at risk but the FBI didn't want to cause panic by warning riders, a rumor localized to San Bernardino claimed that after a mass shooting there local sheriffs anticipated (but did not warn) residents of potential attacks at malls and movie theaters, and another asserted that authorities had suppressed warnings about an impending attack on a mall in Illinois.\nWe contacted the Bates County Sheriff's Department in Bates County, Missouri, to ask whether any warnings (official or unofficial) had been passed on by FBI agents to local law enforcement about the possible use of propane bombs \"across the state.\" The individual to whom we spoke said the claim was unequivocally false and reiterated that law enforcement believed the tank thefts were unrelated to terrorism.\nA common thread of these rumors involved law enforcement both knowing of imminent danger yet refusing to minimize potential casualties by broadcasting alerts.\nRumors of this type serve an important function for both the teller and the listener, which is to provide anxious citizens with a means of regain a sense of control in times of heightened anxiety and uncertainty. We may not be able to do anything for the victims of past attacks, but we can feel like we're proactively doing something about terrorism now by spreading information that may help save other lives.",

        "content": "Claim:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump leaked classified information about a U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia after receiving his first national security intelligence briefing.\nIt's standard operating procedure during a U.S. presidential election year for the duly nominated candidate of each party to receive one or more national security briefings after the close of the Republican and Democratic conventions. On 29 July 2016, the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Philadelphia, the mainstream media reported that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would receive their first such briefings as early as the following week.\nThe briefings aren't as detailed as those a sitting president gets, the Washington Post reported, nor is the information shared in them deeply sensitive, nor, in fact, are the briefings even required, according to historian Michael Beschloss. They began under the Truman administration in 1952 and are provided strictly as a courtesy to the candidates.\nOne respect in which the 2016 campaign differs from others in recent memory is the fact that there have been calls from some in both political parties to deny the other's candidate access to secret intelligence on the grounds that they can't be trusted  Clinton because classified information was found on her private e-mail server and Trump because he publicly called for President Vladimir Putin of Russia  albeit jokingly, Trump later said  to spy on Clinton's e-mail traffic.\nAs if made to order, a flap erupted on 29 July when Trump gave a speech in Colorado Springs in which he reiterated a familiar complaint about NATO member nations not contributing their fair share to pay defense costs, this time expressing displeasure that \"We pay rent for our base in Saudi Arabia.\"\nAs noted by The Guardian and others in reporting on the speech, the U.S. closed its main military base in Saudi Arabia in 2003. (Also, Saudi Arabia is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.)\nTalk of Trump revealing classified information at that moment appears to have originated via Twitter with this exchange initiated by journalist Ben Jacobs:\nA short time later, Jameson Parker posted an article on IfYouOnlyNews.com entitled \"Trump May Have Leaked Classified Info on His First Day Getting Intelligence Briefings.\" Parker wrote:\nIf America does still have a base in Saudi Arabia it was a site not meant to be made public. The consequences of having that exposed could quite have massive consequences for Americas role in the Middle East.\nThere are two possibilities here: Either Donald Trump is so woefully out of touch with American foreign policy that he thinks a base that closed down 13 years ago is still open  or he just leaked a staggering nugget of classified information. Should it come to light that there is indeed a secret base in Saudi Arabia, you can forget about homebrew servers  Trump just committed a massive crime.\nReverb Press followed suit, making essentially the same case. That article was tweeted, retweeted, and ultimately reposted on Daily Kos, Democratic Underground and other left-leaning sites, none of which appeared too concerned (at least initially) that what they were repeating was purely speculative; it was also false.\nConsider this: Nowhere has it been reported that Donald Trump actually had an intelligence briefing before he gave the speech in Colorado Springs. In fact, he gave that speech on the same day the Washington Post reported that candidate briefings could take place \"perhaps as early as next week.\"\nMoreover, Trump's complaint about Saudi Arabia and NATO countries not paying their share of defense costs is a familiar refrain  he mentions it in virtually every speech he makes about foreign policy issues. In point of fact, erroneously on his part or not, Trump has raised the specific issue of the U.S. having to pay rent on bases in Saudi Arabia before. He did it most recently in an interview with the New York Times on 25 March 2016  months before he was nominated and became eligible to receive intelligence briefings:\nFrom China to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance, protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend, when they're sitting with trillions of dollars, I mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, now they're still making a fortune, you know, their oil is very high and very easy to get it, very inexpensive, but they're still making a lot of money, but they were making a billion dollars a day and we were paying leases for bases? We're paying leases, we're paying rent? OK? To have bases over there? The whole thing is preposterous.\nThere is no evidence that Donald Trump received a national security intelligence briefing before his 29 July 2016 speech in Colorado Springs, nor did he say anything he hasn't said before about U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia.",

(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

He told you 9/11 led my country to abandon its ideals, particularly in the Middle East. He told you that the United States and the Muslim world needed 'a new beginning.' The results of these misjudgments have been dire.\"\nPompeo said that the U.S. was \"timid\" about \"asserting ourselves when the times  and our partners  demanded it.\"\nThe secretary did not mention Obama by name but the remarks still struck listeners in the U.S. as unusually partisan.\n\"It's a speech shocking for its use of domestic politics, for kind of attacking a prior president in an international setting and for going to a long-time ally and questioning some of the foundations of the relationship with the ally,\" said Heather Hurlburt, an analyst with the New America, a nonpartisan think tank. \"Those are all things that secretaries of state don't normally do but seem to becoming standard practice with Pompeo.\"\nPompeo's speech came on the third leg of a nine-nation Mideast tour aimed at reassuring America's Arab partners that the Trump administration is not walking away from the region amid confusion and concern over plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria.\nFormer Obama administration officials rejected Pompeo's assertions as petty, political and weak. They said the speech pandered to authoritarian leaders and ignored rights violations that Obama had called out.\n\"That this administration feels the need, nearly a decade later, to take potshots at an effort to identify common ground between the Arab world and the West speaks not only to the Trump administration's pettiness but also to its lack of a strategic vision for America's role in the region and its abdication of America's values,\" National Security Action group, a group of former officials, said in a statement.\nRob Malley, who was Obama's national security council director for the Middle East and is now at the International Crisis Group, said hearing Pompeo's speech was like \"like listening to someone from a parallel universe\" in which the region's shortcomings were ignored.\n\"In that parallel universe, the Arab public probably will receive it enthusiastically,\" he said. \"Back on planet earth, they will see it for what it is: a self-congratulatory, delusional depiction of the Trump administration's Middle East policy.\"\nPompeo blamed the previous administration's approach to the Mideast for the ills that consume it now, particularly the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and Iran's increasing assertiveness, which he said was a direct result of sanctions relief, since rescinded by the Trump administration, granted to it under the 2015 nuclear deal.\nHe said Obama ignored the growth of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon to the detriment of Israel's security and not doing enough to push back on Iran-supported rebels in Yemen.\nSince Trump's election, however, Pompeo claimed this was all changing.\n\"The good news is this: The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering,\" he said. \"Now comes the real 'new beginning.' In just 24 months, actually less than two years, the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region, because we've learned from our mistakes.\"\nIn the speech entitled \"A Force for Good: America's Reinvigorated Role in the Middle East,\" Pompeo extolled the Trump administration's actions across the region cementing ties with traditional, albeit authoritarian, friendly governments, taking on the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and imposing tough new sanctions on Iran.\n\"President Trump has reversed our willful blindness to the danger of the regime and withdrew from the failed nuclear deal, with its false promises,\" Pompeo said.\nSince withdrawing from the nuclear deal last year, the administration has steadily ratcheted up pressure on Tehran and routinely accuses the nation of being the most destabilizing influence in the region. It has vowed to increase the pressure until Iran halts what U.S. officials describe as its \"malign activities\" throughout the Mideast and elsewhere, including support for rebels in Yemen, anti-Israel groups, and Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\"The nations of the Middle East will never enjoy security, achieve economic stability, or advance the dreams of its peoples if Iran's revolutionary regime persists on its current course,\" Pompeo said.",

Many of the baseless claims associated with the caravan centered on the idea that the group was violent and posed an immediate threat to American citizens. For example, one image shared on social media purportedly showed members of this caravan dragging a Mexican official through the streets:\nAs usual, this photograph was not connected to the caravan of asylum seekers traveling toward the United States in October 2018 and originated in a different time and place. This picture was actually taken in November 2014 and related to violent protests in Acapulco, Mexico, over the disappearance of 43 students.\nThis photograph was shot by Pedro Pardo and is available via Getty Images, where it is posted with the following caption:\nDemonstrators hold a riot police during clashes following a protest against the suspected massacre of 43 missing students, near the airport in Acapulco, in the Mexican state of Guerrero State, on November 10, 2014. Protesters angry at the suspected massacre threw stones and a firebomb at riot police in the Pacific resort of Acapulco on Monday, injuring 11 officers. Around 300 students, some wearing masks and armed with sticks and machetes, were joined by some parents of the 43 missing young men as they marched toward the city's airport, but police blocked their way. Mexico was confronted with one of the grisliest massacres in years of drug violence after gang suspects confessed to slaughtering 43 missing students and dumping their charcoaled remains in a river.\nA November 2014 news report from The Guardian provides some context to the protests associated with this photograph:\nThe disappearance of the students had already sparked numerous peaceful demonstrations punctuated by the occasional outbreak of violence.\nTension has intensified, however, since the announcement by attorney general Jess Murillo that a large group of young people were massacred in a rubbish tip near Iguala a few hours after the students were arrested. He said that the victims were then burned on a huge pyre for 14 hours, making identification of the remains recovered by the authorities very difficult.\nThe parents have accused the government of trying to close down the case.\nPrior to the announcement of the massacre, the authorities had said they recovered at least 38 bodies from nine mass graves near Iguala. Attorney general Murillo said four of these have now been identified as people who disappeared at checkpoints set up by Guerreros Unidos gang members and the municipal police.",

Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nThe National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a quiet admission that marijuana kills cancer:\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe report in question is the NCIs Physician Data Query (PDQ) on Cannabis and Cannabinoids. The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as marijuana kills cancer.\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the overview section:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells  including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet admission of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added quietly in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ prove that cannabis kills cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not prove anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be cured by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has no currently accepted medical use, which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Governments official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal governments center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI admitted that cannabis kills cancer uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way prove that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

        "content": "Claim:\nCountry star Willie Nelson has died.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nThe legendary country singer Willie Nelson is a frequent target of celebrity death hoaxes, the most recent iteration occurring in August 2015. One of the more prominent purveyors of this particular celebrity death hoax has been the fake news web site MSMBC.co (deliberately titled so as to cause confusion with the genuine news site MSNBC.com), which on 21 February 2015 published a false report claiming the famous musician had passed away, then updated their hoax article again on 11 April 2015 and started a new round of the fake Willie Nelson death rumor:\nLegendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson's death first circulated early April 11, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson's property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.\n\"There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,\" said Det. Aldeson.\n\"Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,\" said County Coroner Frank Shultz. \"It's just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.\"\nThe shocking news comes just days after a recent \"60 Minutes\" interview where Nelson was quoted as saying \"Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.\"\nThe fake MSMBC.co article unfortunately fooled many readers as it made the rounds of social media again, even though it was completely false and was just a recycled version of the very same prank the site released months earlier. The latter part of the article's statement that the \"story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified,\" is technically correct, as nothing about the story has been \"officially verified\" because none of it is even remotely true.\nNo legitimate news outlet has reported on Nelson's death, which is not surprising since the 84-year-old music star is actually alive and well, still commenting on current political issues and singing about how he's not really dead:\nWillie Nelson may be getting old but he is so done with the death rumors.\nTwo days before the singer turned 84, (Saturday, April 29,) he released a timely new music video for his song \"Still Not Dead,\" from his newest album, \"God's Problem Child.\"\nNelson first sings in the toe tapping tune, \"I woke up still not dead again today. The internet said I had passed away.\"",

        "title": "Bobbie Nelson, Willie Nelson's sister, has died at 91 : NPR",
        "date": "2022-03-11T12:27:23",
        "content": "Country music pioneer Bobbie Lee Nelson  the sister of Willie Nelson, and a vaunted pianist in her own right  died Thursday at age 91. Her death was announced by her family via social media. They did not reveal the cause of her death, but said that she had died \"peacefully and surrounded by family.\"\nNelson was the first member of her younger brother's band, performing as a pianist and singer. Like her brother, she grew up in Abbott, Texas, where they were raised by their gospel music-loving grandparents. Their parents, Myrle and Ira, divorced early; Myrle left when Willie was six months old, and Ira departed soon after, handing the children to the care of their paternal grandparents.\nBorn Jan. 1, 1931, Bobbie Nelson learned to play the piano by reading four-part shape-note harmonies in hymn books. And she fell in love with boogie-woogie, which she played for her school classmates.\nIn his 2015 autobiography, It's a Long Story: My Life, Willie Nelson wrote: \"Bobbie became accomplished at an early age. I lagged behind  and remain so to this day. Bobbie is a musician in the true sense of being able to play with great facility in any style. She learned to read beautifully and was known far and around Hill County as a genuine piano prodigy.\"\nBy age 16, Nelson had fallen in love with and quickly married a man named Bud Fletcher, who recognized the siblings' talent. Despite having no musical skills himself, Fletcher built a band called Bud Fletcher and The Texans featuring the siblings, with the Nelsons' father playing rhythm guitar. And because she was with her family, Bobbie Nelson was able to slip into bars to play  a scandalous situation for a young woman.\nThe marriage began to fall apart, though, and The Texans disbanded in 1955 when Fletcher and Nelson divorced. But because of the shame of Bobbie's work in honky-tonks, initial custody of their three young sons was given to Fletcher's parents  and Nelson couldn't continue to play in bars.\nIn a 2008 feature on All Things Considered, Nelson reflected on this difficult time in her life. \"I thought, 'How can I earn enough money to support my children and to show the world that I can support my children? I want my babies,'\" she remembered. \"And that was the hardest part of my life. And I couldn't play with Willie at that time, because I wasn't supposed to even enter into a club. They would not have agreed to let me have my children back.\"\nThe answer Nelson hit upon was to attend business college, and then get a job with the Hammond Organ Company in its Fort Worth location, where she demonstrated instruments.\nBut once her brother, who had already written hits within the Nashville country machine for artists like Ray Price and Patsy Cline, went to New York in 1973 to record himself, she heeded the call for \"Sister Bobbie\" to come record with him on the project that became Shotgun Willie. By then, her children were grown.\nBobbie Nelson went on to tour and record with her brother Willie for decades, appearing on many of his albums, spanning Red Headed Stranger in 1975 to The Willie Nelson Family just last year.\nNelson did not release a solo album of her own until 2008, shortly before she turned 77. It was called Audiobiography  and it was the only one she ever released. Co-billed with Willie, however, she released several albums: in 1986, I'd Rather Have Jesus; 1996's How Great Thou Art; in 1997, Hill Country Christmas; and 2014's December Day: Willie's Stash, Vol.1.\nIn 2020, Willie and Bobbie Nelson co-authored a memoir called Me and Sister Bobbie: True Tales of the Family Band. In it, Willie wrote: \"I've written a few books before, but there's one that passed me by. Probably passed me by 'cause the heroine is too humble to demand attention. The heroine is my sister, Bobbie. Bobbie's got the best story in our whole family. ... Without my sister, I'd never be where I am today. I've always needed her.\"",

        "date": "2017-01-19T23:39:00",
        "content": "Televangelist Paula White has a few things in common with the president-elect.\nThe preacher made a name for herself on television  much like Donald Trump  and both have used controversial, nontraditional business practices that have been the subject of government inquires. White, like Trump, is on her third marriage, this time to Journey rocker Jonathan Cain, and both are boosted by wealth and celebrity.\nSo its perhaps no surprise that White is Trump's spiritual adviser  and has been for more than a decade. She'll take the stage with Trump to pray at Friday's inauguration.\nTheir fifteen-year relationship began when Trump cold-called White.\n\"I pick up the phone and he begins to say to me, 'I've been watching you on television,'\" White recalled in an interview with NBC News that aired on Nightly News on Thursday.\nWhite is one of six religious leaders who will pray over Trump's swearing in on January 20th. In a wide-ranging interview with NBC Nightly News ahead of her prayer, White attested to the sometimes elusive spirituality of the president-elect, while pushing back the vocal critics who say White shouldn't be involved in the inauguration.\nI know that Donald is saved, White told NBC News in a pre-taped interview. He's absolutely  received Jesus Christ as his lord and savior.\nRelated: Whats Behind Evangelical Support for Donald Trump? Less Than You Think\nWhite wont take credit for bringing Trump to Jesus, but she is the most vocal defendants of his faith  something thats complicated by Trump not going to Church regularly and his repeated insistence that hes never asked God for forgiveness, a fundamental part of being born again for evangelical Christians.\nI know that he's asked for forgiveness. I know that he has sought and understands the truth of that, White told NBC News, insisting that his repeated statements that hes never asked for forgiveness had been taken out of context and that his public persona kept him away from public church services. I understand on a much more personal level his walk. It's not something he feels comfortable ... He doesn't know our Christian-ese or language. ... But that doesn't mean he's not a man of faith.\nWhite said she saw his faith on display in 2011, when he asked her to gather pastors together to pray with him in 2011, when he was debating jumping in the 2012 presidential race.\nAnd we prayed over him. We sat with him for about six hours. This wasn't like-- like an hour or ten minutes; it was six hours. It was an all day meeting and we prayed for hours. And we listened, we talked, we conversed and and the next day, I called him or he called me, one ... one or the other. And he said, 'I' -- 'I don't believe it's the timing of God, White recalled.\nWhen White isnt defending Trump, shes defending her own ministry, which was subject to a three year Congressional inquiry lead by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley for shady fundraising principles and criticized by other Christians for what they call the \"prosperity gospel\"  preaching that followers who donate large sums will be made wealthy by God.\nWhite is quick to note that Grassley's investigation into her fundraising was technically an inquiry (\"We fully cooperated,\" she said) and resulted in no findings of wrongdoing or penalties. She disagrees with the characterization of the \"prosperity gospel\" and of course disagrees with critics who call her a charlatan and a heretic.\nShe says donations, even the hefty four figure ones, are to help the ministry and its televised operations pay bills, and the prosperity gospel is misunderstood to be all about money.\nShes also quick to say that in her younger years, she wasnt always her ministrys best messenger.\nSo have I ever said that God would bless you back financially? I'm sure I have. I'm absolutely sure somewhere. But do I principally believe? Like I'm not gonna say, \"I have never said that,\" White said with a laugh. But do I teach fundamentally like, \"Give to give. Give to get. Get to get?\" No. That is not the principle or the basis of who Paula White is.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photo shared to Twitter on Feb. 13, 2021, documented a human-sized lion mane mushroom growing in a swamp.\nA photograph shared on Twitter on Feb. 13, 2021, claimed to depict a large lion mane mushroom growing in a swamp that at the time of this writing had been liked more than 46,000 times on the social media platform.\nhttps://twitter.com/es_aion/status/1360586394574462982?s=21https://twitter.com/es_aion/status/1360586394574462982?s=21\nA reverse-image search revealed that in the days following the above tweet, the photograph accompanied posts on Tumblr and Reddit that also claimed it featured a lions mane shroom. But there was virtually no credibility to the tall tale spun by the Twitter user @es_aion.\nThe lions mane mushroom has several other names, including monkey head, bearded tooth, pom pom, and its scientific designation, Hericium erinaceus. Native to North America, Europe, and Asia, these wispy, white fungi grow in a singly clump with long spines on hardwoods like Beech trees. And though the white fruitbodies of these mushrooms can grow to be football-sized  up to 15 inches in diameter, with its spines just under 2 inches  the edible fungus has rarely been recorded in the wild and never to the size of a human.\nBut as a Twitter user by the handle @transittracer pointed out, the photo in question actually showed an art installation by Susi Brister. Snopes contacted Brister, who confirmed that the tweet inaccurately represented her art installation titled, 613 Silky Straight in Swamp, which was initially made in 2013 and shown at the Lawndale Art Center in Houston, Texas, reported the Houston Press at the time. Austin 360, a Texas-based news outlet published by the Austin American-Statesman, described Bristers work as enigmatic quasi-human figures draped in strange textiles and then situated in the natural landscape.\nThe suit was handmade by me using platinum blonde hair extensions and there is a human inside the suit, Brister told Snopes, adding that the sculpture was part of a larger body of work titled, Fantastic Habitat.\nThe suit itself was tall enough to fit a model who was approximately 6 feet 2  and Brister said the 100 hair extensions still drug on the ground. The artwork is actually the photograph, while the sculptural suit was only created to be worn for the photograph.\n\"The banal details of the extensions themselves are 613 (which corresponds to the color platinum) and Silky Straight (which refers to the texture of the hair), hence the title of the piece,\" said Brister. \"It's meant to be mysterious, but also reveal the reality of the materials it's made from.\"\nBrister's photograph of the swamp-like ghoul was again featured in 2014 by the nonprofit arts organization Women and their Work. In a blog post, Brister described her work as depicting anonymous figures covered in textiles and inserted into a landscape:\nMy current photographic work depicts anonymous figures covered in densely textured or patterned textiles inserted into various landscapes as mysterious organic forms. Lush faux fur and vivid fabrics conceal the still figures, producing a bizarre visual and contextual relationship between the shrouded form and its environment and at times creating a landscape-within-landscape effect. Acrylic neon crystals, camouflaging textiles, twisted piles of brightly colored tape, and layers upon layers of artificial hair extensions shroud forms that integrate with or interrupt the natural environment in a seeming attempt to blend in, but which ultimately emphasize the gap between the natural world and its synthetic imitations.\nThroughout this work I am questioning the nature of sculpture, performance, and portraiture, playing with notions of natural vs. artificial, and challenging traditional photographic renderings of the figure in the landscape. At once both humorous and melancholy, these images resonate with a psychological tension, evoking notions of the sublime and the slippage between real and imaginary\nAs for its newly viral status nearly a decade later, Brister said that she's not sure why the photograph is receiving so much attention.\n\"I'm not sure why someone might choose to share the image now. A few months ago, at the end of 2020, quite a few people were re-posting the image on Instagram (both with and without crediting me)  with a lot of references to the feeling of dragging through the end of the weird year we just had,\" she said.\n\"I'm fascinated that this image seems to resonate for people at this moment in time, and I'm ultimately happy that people are seeing it. Though why anyone would post about it being a mushroom is somewhat baffling to me  I think it's much more interesting as a platinum swamp creature,\" added Brister.\nSo, while art may be in the eye of the beholder, the facts remain the same.",

But what is increasingly important in Detroit and all over this country is to make sure that people have clean drinking water at a rate that they can afford. Water is a basic necessity of life, it doesn't get more basic than that. Food and water. You don't survive without it. And people should not  large corporations should not be making huge profits in terms of ownership of water.

No. It can't happen. I've watched a lighting authority come into my city and pretty much blacken out a whole neighborhood. They didn't deserve to be left behind, because why? Because who wrote the bill? It was the private industry that came in and wrote the bill and basically left some of the most neglected neighborhoods without any lights. So even just a simple quasi-governmental authority bled into profits before the people and I just can't stand by and say, \"yeah let's figure out a middle ground.\" We can't, I've seen it over and over again in my city and the community I grew up in where it just doesn't work that way.

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows members of the NYPD wearing \"I Can Breathe\" shirts mocking the death of George Floyd.\nA photograph of a group of men wearing shirts saying \"I Can Breathe\" spread online between late May and early June 2020 after the death of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd while in custody of Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer. The shirts appear to be in a Comic Sans font, and those wearing them are holding up a sign supporting the New York Police Department, prompting Snopes readers to ask us if they were members of the NYPD.\nThe shirts would appear to be both a dark and flippant play on words stemming from one of the last statements uttered by Floyd before he died on May 25, which was \"I can't breathe.\"\nBut the image actually shows protesters from a demonstration in December 2014, months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of an NYPD officer, and more than five years before the death of George Floyd.\nIn July 2014, Garner died as a result of police officer Daniel Pantaleo placing him in a chokehold. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for protesters calling for an end to police killings of black people. In early December 2014, a grand jury found \"no reasonable cause\" to bring charges against Pantaleo, triggering protests. In July 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered that the case against Pantaleo be dropped, and a month later, Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD.\nAccording to one report from the 2014 demonstration, about 100 people gathered outside New York's City Hall in support of the NYPD on Dec. 19, while other reports said the number was closer to 50. The pro-NYPD gathering, organized by a group called Thank You NYPD, faced off against around 200 counter-protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Organizers from Thank You NYPD told The Village Voice that their group was not made up of police officers, but \"citizens who appreciate the safety that the NYPD provides our great city. Ten million people policed by 35,000 officers is one hell of a task to handle.\"\nAt the demonstration, the pro-NYPD protesters chanted \"Don't resist arrest\" when the anti-police brutality demonstrators chanted \"I can't breathe.\"\nA video from the protest, by ReasonTV, sets the scene:\nA 2014 report from Gawker included some of the shirt-wearer's perspectives. An attendee named Mike Stables had flown in from Colorado for the protest, bringing \"I Can Breathe\" T-shirts with him.\nWhile it is not clear whether many NYPD cops were part of the protests or wearing the shirts, a number of people close to the police were present. Some attendees included a retired NYPD detective and a mother of an NYPD officer. According to CBS, neither Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, nor police unions, endorsed the rally because of concerns about violence. Bratton expected a low turnout. Patrick Lynch, a police union leader, complained about the lack of support from New York City's mayor and his administration:\nPetulant police union leader Pat Lynch recently complained of the lack of support coming from City Hall: \"If they're not going to support us when we need 'em, we'll embarrass them when we can.\"\nIn the above video, a pro-NYPD protester at City Hall responded to a journalist's comment on how the police use force to defend themselves: \"They do it with force -- well, no, we're not allowed to use force.\"\nSteven W. Thrasher, a columnist and faculty member at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, reflected on his coverage of the December 2014 protest for Contexts. By his account, off-duty cops were indeed present:\nHere I was, being 'protected' by the NYPD on duty, surrounded by angry, white, retired and off-duty cops and their supporters. Who hated the press and, it seemed, Black people  and I was in the middle of them.\nAnother report from Gothamist relates an exchange between protesters, indicating more off-duty cops were present:\n\"Where's your badge?\" one woman asked a man on the police side.\n\"It's in my pocket!\" the man replied.\n\"Why don't you take it out?\"\n\"I don't have to, I'm not on duty, bitch!\"\n... \"My boss told me to behave myself tonight,\" said Scott, a police officer who works in Connecticut.\nIt is clear from multiple reports that off-duty cops were indeed present at the pro-police side of the rally, but we are still unable to determine if any of them were wearing the shirts saying \"I Can Breathe.\" We do know that these images are from a 2014 rally supporting the NYPD after the death of Garner, and not in response to the death of Floyd. We thus rate this image as \"Miscaptioned.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a naked child using bedsheets to escape from an upper story of Buckingham Palace.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nContext\nThe video was released on YouTube as a \"stealth promotion\" for the E! comedy series \"The Royals.\" It did not depict an actual event, nor was the naked male seen in the video a child.\nOrigin\nA video posted to the \"Covert Geopolitics\" YouTube channel in November 2019 purported to capture a \"fully naked 'Filipino looking child' escaping from a window of the Buckingham Palace in the middle of the day.\" The clip was accompanied by a voice-over narration that consisted of a long diatribe about \"pedophiles\" and \"Satanists.\" Our partial transcript below gives a general idea of what the narrator tried to convey (minus the profanity):\nThis is how disturbing your world really is. I've been holding on to this footage for way too long. Every time I decide to post it, they take it down.\n[...]\nWhat's up? I mean, the top floor [of] Buckingham Palace ... just a naked-looking Filipino kid, you know, tied a whole bunch of sheets together just ... just for the heck of it. Yeah, that's it. Just for the heck of it. He's willing to try to escape naked, leap out of that floor, while a parade is going by. What has happened to that kid that he's willing to do that? Imagine that.\nThis kid looks like he falls to death here in about 10 seconds. This is what you are deciding to not listen to and not understand, on everything that I've been trying to tell you what's going on in the world. Your world is run by Satanists, and these are their victims, and we seem to think that it's just funny and okay. That's [expletive] sad. The world you live in people, controlled by pedophiles.\n[...]\nHowever, neither the video clip nor the description of it offered by \"Covert Geopolitics\" was real. The \"Covert Geopolitics\" version of the clip was actually a slowed-down, looped, lower-resolution version of a video  purportedly captured by a tourist in London  that prompted a good deal of consternation and speculation when it mysteriously appeared online in February 2015. The Mirror wrote:\nThis extraordinary video clip appears to show a man scaling Buckingham Palace  completely nude.\nThe shocking clip was posted on YouTube earlier today and has so far been watched by more than 500 people.\nIt appears to show a man climbing down from a window before falling spectacularly.\nThe incident was captured by bystanders standing over the road from the royal residence.\nIt is not known whether the man was injured in the apparent fall.\nIt's also not clear whether the clip is a hoax, but we will bring you more details as we get them.\nA spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the video.\nThat clip, in turn, was a stealth promotion created for the upcoming premiere of the E! Entertainment television series \"The Royals,\" a \"drama about a fictional British Royal family who inhabit a world of luxury and regal tradition that also involves intrigue and unexpected twists, revealing the complexities faced by royals trying to maintain high-profile relationships under scrutiny.\" From the E! Online website:\nThe [naked guy] video made headlines when it was uploaded from what seemed to be a tourist's YouTube channel while visiting Buckingham Palace during the changing of the guard.\nIn the video, an almost completely naked man (minus a sock) was seen climbing down a bed sheet, on the side of the palace from a window. Blogs and news agencies from Daily Mail to Cosmopolitan covered the video not knowing whether it was real or fake while users took to the comments to share their opinions.\nBut now, we have answers. With the \"exclusive, never-before-seen extended footage of the scandal\" from D-Throned, an online tabloid covering E!'s fictional modern day royal family from \"The Royals,\" it's clear that this was a clever way for E! to give viewers a glimpse of the drama that will go down on the upcoming premiere season of the new show.\nIn the full tabloid video, viewers see that the naked man was actually escaping from Princess Eleanor's (Alexandra Park) chambers, once again putting her back into the spotlight. \"The renegade royal has been spotted dancing wildly at a late night club and snogging at least one member of the cabinet,\" the narrator explains.\nThe full video can be viewed on Vimeo.\nThe promotional strategy was conceived by the advertising company Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), which also created a short video asserting bragging rights over its worldwide success. Producer SF Hartley did the same.\nWhatever activities the satanists of the world might be up to, producing viral commercials for cable television dramas is probably not among them.\nSources:\ndthronednews.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isnt how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? Its not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didnt have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasnt replaced because a process wasnt codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobarts absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldnt become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but thats for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

Surprisingly, we found an additional photograph of this SnAK-47, which indicates that this is a physical object, not a digitally created one:\nWhile these pictures appear to document a physical object, this \"snake\" is not real. For one, it seems unlikely that a snake's body would wrap so tightly around the angular shape of this gun. If a snake did eat an AK-47, its body would stretch from one protuberance to another, creating a more rounded shape.\nSo if this picture isn't photoshopped, and if this physical object isn't a real snake, what exactly does it show?\nIt shows art work created by Vasily Slonov, a Russian political artist, called \"Python-AK.\" According to Artsy.net, this art is made of rubber and was created in 2019.",

        "content": "On May 27, 1937, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge opened, connecting bustling San Francisco to sleepy Marin County to the north. The Oakland-Bay Bridge had opened six months earlier  but the Golden Gate was an engineering triumph. It straddles the Golden Gate Strait, the passage from the Pacific Ocean into the San Francisco Bay, where rough currents prevail and winds can reach 70 mph.\nThe bridge's opening day was strictly for pedestrians. The day was typical for May in San Francisco: foggy, windy and cold. That didn't stop 200,000 people from crossing the bridge. Many walked. Others ran, tap-danced, roller-skated, unicycled or strode on stilts.\nThe night before the bridge opened, 16-year-old Edgar Stone and two high school friends finished watching a movie in a San Francisco theater. They decided to head to the bridge and be the first in line to cross.\nThey hung out all night, unable to sleep. Come morning, they trotted across the almost 2-mile span. When they got to the other side, the three teens collapsed on a railing to rest.\n\"We thought if we got lucky, we might get our picture in the paper,\" says Stone, who's now 91. And they did get lucky: A photographer from the News-Call Bulletin snapped the three teens leaning into each other, eyes closed.\n\"We were truly tired, although we were putting on a bit of show,\" Stone says. Besides the exhaustion, Stone remembers being above the San Francisco Bay for the first time and how far down the water appeared. \"Kind of a little frightening to look over,\" he recalls.\nNancy Kent Danielson, 85, had the same feeling as she saw the vast ocean on one side of the railing and the bay on the other. She was only 11 when she crossed the bridge on opening day with her parents and twin sister, Martye.\n\"But I was looking at people's waists,\" she says. \"I did notice that the roadway rose under our feet, that we were going uphill, and that took us all the way to the middle of the bridge before it leveled off, and then we could go down a bit.\"\nWhen it opened, the Golden Gate was the longest suspension bridge in the world. And it helped the city grow  but not everyone liked the idea.\n\"My father had a friend who thought the worst crime in the world would be to put a bridge there and spoil the beauty of nature,\" Danielson says.\nThe Marin Garden Club, where Danielson's mother was a member, even wrote letters in protest of the bridge's unusual color. \"They didn't think it should be anything but silver,\" she says.\n\"We suspected the bridge was going up just so it could ruin Marin County,\" she says. Marin residents were bracing for saloons and quick-food stands. And that's just what happened, Danielson says. With a laugh, she adds, \"I love people, but there are too many of us!\"\nLola Silvestri, 90, remembers reading about the building of the bridge practically every day in the newspaper.\n\"They only hired single men because of the danger,\" says Silvestri, who was 16 on opening day. \"We started out on the bridge as strangers,\" she says. \"By the time we got to the other side, we knew everybody.\"\nAt the bridge's last tower, Silvestri met a bridge worker who showed the teenager and her friend where he cemented in a dime. \"I was thinking about that the other day,\" she says. \"It was the end of the Great Depression, and there was the song 'Brother Can You Spare a Dime'  and I was wondering, what could you buy for a dime today?\"\nGeorge Klein, 95, was 20 when the bridge opened. It was cold, and he was wearing shorts. A former high school track star, he hoped to be the first to cross from the north end of the bridge in Marin.\n\"I ran all the way to the other side, but I couldn't find any officials,\" says Klein. So, he just turned around and jogged back.\nWhat Klein or anyone could foresee was that the Golden Gate Bridge was destined to become a global tourist attraction. Back then, it was a symbol of progress even during hard times. And before the bridges, the only way to get around the bay was by ferry.\nBut the ferry had its advantages, Klein says.\n\"I could take a train, then a ferry, and then take another ferry and then a train and make it to downtown Oakland in an hour and five minutes,\" he says. \"And I defy you to do that today with the bridges  that's how things have changed.\"\nThe ferries still run today  they're popular with tourists and some commuters. Their decks provide an open view of the landscape and the Golden Gate Bridge, now 75 years old.\nBack on the bridge's opening day, its chief engineer, Joseph Strauss, read aloud a poem he wrote at nearby Crissy Field:",
        "description": "On May 27, 1937, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge opened, connecting bustling San Francisco to sleepy Marin County to the north. The Oakland-Bay Bridge had opened six months earlier  but the Golden Gate was an engineering triumph. And on its first day, thousands of people walked across it.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows pedestrians swarming the Golden Gate Bridge during its 1937 opening ceremony.\nWhen it opened in 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge that connects the city of San Francisco to Marin County, California, was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world. Although it no longer holds claim to either of those titles (Japan's Akashi Kaiky Bridge exceeds it in both respects), the Golden Gate Bridge remains one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, is one of the most-photographed structures on Earth, and stands as a globally recognized symbol of one American city.\nAs reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, the official opening of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937 was a huge event that spanned nine days of celebrations, with two separate opening days  one for pedestrians and one for cars  drawing hundreds of thousands of bridge-crossers:\nExcitement was so high for the bridge that the Golden Gate Fiesta included nine days of celebrations, and not one opening day but two. The first opening day, May 27, 1937, was limited to pedestrians.\nThe organizing committee estimated that 100,000 people would take advantage of the opportunity to stroll across the bridge without interference from cars, but they seriously underestimated the appeal. From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. that day, more than 200,000 flocked to the bridge for a chance to say they walked across.\nThe next day cars were allowed on the bridge. Precisely at 11 a.m. May 28, dozens of U.S. Navy planes would fly over the Golden Gate Bridge, followed by Navy ships of all sizes  three aircraft carriers, 13 heavy cruisers, six light cruisers and six destroyers  passing underneath the bridge.\nIn recent years, a photograph said to depict that (first) opening day in 1937 has frequently been shared online with the caption \"The Golden Gate Bridge opening to the public for the first time back in 1937, and yes, it almost collapsed\":\nBut this picture doesn't date from 1937, nor did we find any contemporaneous accounts stating that the Golden Gate Bridge \"almost collapsed\" at that time. Although this photograph is displayed in black-and-white and therefore looks fairly \"old\" to modern eyes, it was actually taken in 1987, when an estimated 300,000 people swarmed the bridge during its golden anniversary celebration.\nThe original image was captioned as follows: \"Shot from the South Tower facing south down onto the roadway overlooking a mass of people at the 50th anniversary celebration for the Golden Gate Bridge.\"\nThe crush of pedestrians who crossed the bridge that day in 1987 did cause it to sag about 7 feet at its mid-section, and some onlookers did fear at the time that the structure was in danger of buckling, but engineers maintained that the combined load was well within the bridge's capacity:\nOn May 24, 1987, 300,000 people were stuck in human gridlock for hours while getting a rare chance to cross the 1.7-mile bridge en masse on foot to celebrate the bridges golden anniversary. Officials quickly closed the bridge, so a half-million other people waiting to cross never got the chance. Still, the enormous, unprecedented weight caused the middle of the bridge to sag 7 feet.\nIm grateful because if the others had gotten out there, maybe the bridge would have fallen down, Gary Giacomini, then president of the bridge districts board, told The Associated Press at the time.\nBut engineers said afterward that the bridge was never in danger of collapsing.\nIndependent engineers agree[d] ... that structurally the bridge was safe during the Golden Gates last big celebration.\nIt was probably the biggest load the bridge had ever seen, said Mark Ketchum, a San Francisco bridge engineer who studied the Golden Gate Bridge from 1989 to 1991. But it did not exceed the design load capacity of the bridge.\nOn fully loaded suspension bridges the size of the Golden Gate, its normal to have deflections of up to 10 feet, said Greg Deierlein, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering.",

        "content": "Claim:\nBackless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016.\nIn November 2016, an image macro appeared bearing the unsourced claim that \"backless booster\" seats would be illegal starting in December 2016, and quickly made the usual rounds on social media. It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

Murray, who left public life a few years ago to pursue a more conservative lifestyle, found out he was dying about three months ago but decided not to make a big deal out of it.\nAccording to his spokesman and lawyer, Art Tubolls, Murray left very simple instructions for his passing:\nBill wanted to see America unite under President Trump and come together to fight against all the things hes fought against his entire career. When he wrote the movie Ghostbusters he used Slimer as an example of how feeding something causes dependence. Stripes was to teach the average American that anyone can be a hero if the timing is right.\nNone of this was true: at the time this report was published, Bill Murray was still very much alive and only 68 years old. The report of his death was another fabrication by Conservative Tears, a site which is part of the America's Last Line of Defense network of websites and Facebook pages that pump out a steady stream of inflammatory and politically divisive misinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"",

Right now, this moment is real. Trust me, it is real. Because I see you and I see you  all of these faces of change  and now so will everyone else.\nOh won her first Golden Globe in 2005 for best supporting actress  series, miniseries or television film for her role as Cristina Yang on Greys Anatomy. Since leaving Greys in 2014, Oh worked mostly on smaller projects, with friends and colleagues telling Vulture in August that Oh had really specific ideas about her next move. In June 2017, she became the first actor cast in Killing Eve.\nBased on Luke Jennings' Codename Villanelle novellas and developed for television by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Killing Eve follows Eve Polastri (Oh), a talented but bored officer in MI5, the United Kingdom's domestic security agency. Eve becomes obsessed with tracking down Villanelle (Jodie Comer), a skilled assassin, who in turn becomes obsessed with Eve. Heralded as a rare cat-and-mouse thriller by Vulture, the BBC America show premiered in April and has been widely praised by critics, whose first season reviews have given it a 97 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nThe second season is scheduled to premiere in spring 2019.",

        "content": "The heat is unrelenting in the middle of a December day in eastern Sudan. It's hard to find any shade in this arid landscape. It's mostly dust and boulders  and, for now at least, it is the temporary home of tens of thousands of Ethiopian refugees who have crossed the border to flee the fighting in their country.\nThere's not much to make a home. The nearest town, Al Qadarif, is two hours away. No water source exists at the camps, so water is trucked in from miles away through rugged roads. Refugees are sleeping in makeshift tents and in abandoned buildings. Some are even sleeping outside with no shelter.\nLast month, the Ethiopian government launched a military offensive against a rebellious regional government. The ensuing conflict has killed hundreds, and almost 50,000 Ethiopians have crossed the country's northwestern border into Sudan. It's a refugee crisis that is straining the humanitarian infrastructure in the country. The United Nations refugee agency has appealed for $150 million to help cope with the situation.\nAt Village 8 Camp, Measho Fishale, 34, is trying to make a stew out of the sorghum that humanitarian groups have been handing out. It isn't really working. All she can do is stand above the stove in the sun, holding her toddler.\nShe has seven children, but when the fighting started in the town of Mai-Kadra in early November, her two oldest were not at home.\n\"[Militias] were slaughtering people with knives and machetes,\" she says.\nMany other refugees describe the same scene: They say members of Fano, a youth militia loyal to the government, rampaged through Mai-Kadra killing ethnic Tigrayans. The government has repeatedly disputed that narrative, saying it was a youth militia affiliated with the Tigrayan rebels who killed ethnic Amharas, Ethiopia's second-biggest ethnic group.\nNPR could not independently corroborate the refugees' claims, but dozens of them told the same story.\nMeasho says she had no choice but to run immediately. She has looked for the two children she left behind in Ethiopia, hoping they would have found their way to the camp, but she hasn't been able to find them.\nStanding next to Measho is 55-year-old Kidan Berhe. She wanted to stay home, despite the war and didn't think she could make the arduous walk through the bush into Sudan. But then armed men swept through the town, and she thought about her children having to return to look for her. She worried they would be killed as well, so she left everything and walked for hours toward Sudan.\n\"This is all I have,\" she says, pointing to her clothes. Tears well up in her eyes and she presses her hands against her face.\n\"My gold. My clothes. I have lost everything,\" she tells NPR.\nShe says she now feels safe in Sudan but worries about her future and about the bleak living conditions at the camps. Humanitarian workers are struggling to keep up with the flow of refugees and to build up an infrastructure to accommodate them.\nNadir Ibrahim, a local humanitarian worker, says the refugees \"need water; there are no latrines; they are doing open defecation.\" If this continues, he warns, disease will run rampant at these camps.\nRefugees are doing what they can with whatever they can. They're building shelter out of grass. They are trying to make injera  the traditional Ethiopian bread usually made from a grain called teff  from the sorghum that is given out by aid agencies.\nIn Ethiopia, the situation appears more severe. The United Nations has said that refugees in the Tigray Region have received no aid since conflict started. The more than 96,000 Eritrean refugees in Tigray, who have fled war and repression in the past two decades, the U.N. says, have run out of food rations. The U.N. has received reports that refugees are leaving camps because of violence.\nEthiopia and the U.N. had reached an agreement giving aid groups access to the Tigray Region, but last week, the Ethiopian military shot at a U.N. convoy and the government warned it did not need a \"babysitter.\" On Friday, the International Rescue Committee said one of its staff members had been killed at a camp in Tigray.\nEthiopia has said that the military operation in the country is over, because it has taken control of the Tigray Region capital, Mekelle. But the Tigray People's Liberation Front says it will not surrender to what it considers an invading army, and fighting has continued on many fronts.\nThe war is a power struggle between Ethiopia's new government and its old one; it's about what the Ethiopian political system will look like in the future. But in interviews with refugees, the war is about loss. Everyone, no matter which side they're on, is mourning. Some have lost loved ones; many others have lost homes. And every inch of the refugee camps in Sudan has become about grasping at some semblance of what they had before the war.\nAt the Um Rakuba camp, Fitsum Kidanemariam, 25, says he left his parents back in Ethiopia. He hasn't been able to call them, so he doesn't know their fate.\nHe's a slim young man and his voice breaks as he explains his situation. Back home, his love was art, but he had to work in construction because, like anywhere in the world, \"there is no money in art,\" he says.\nHe walks past a huge tent filled with sacks of sorghum, past a little hut where women sell coffee. He enters what looked like an abandoned schoolhouse. It's just a shell now  most of the windows are broken; there are no doors; the paint is peeling. His friends play cards on the floor. On the windowsill, just behind them, he has lined up seven sculptures that he made out of rocks he found in the camp.\nOn one of them, he carved the face of a woman on one side and the face of a lion on the other.\n\"The woman is forgiving and respectful,\" he says. \"The lion, like warring men, will lash out at the slightest touch.\"\nFitsum sculpts every day. For hours, he meticulously carves rocks using a piece of steel he found at the camp. He's trying to forget the violence, hoping that his parents are still alive. He says he spent hours sculpting this rock, dreaming of a different life where humans were less like lions.",

        "content": "Uganda's long-time President Yoweri Museveni has been re-elected, electoral officials say, amid accusations of vote fraud by his main rival Bobi Wine.\nMr Museveni won almost 59% of the vote, with Bobi Wine trailing with about 35%, the Electoral Commission said.\nThursday's poll may turn out to be the \"most cheating-free\" in the history of the African nation, the president said.\nBobi Wine, a former pop star, vowed to provide evidence of vote-rigging when internet connections were restored.\nThe government shut down the internet ahead of voting day, a move condemned by election monitors.\nThey said confidence in the count had been damaged by the days-long cut. A government minister told the BBC on Saturday evening that the internet service would be restored \"very soon\".\nIn a phone interview with the BBC World Service, Bobi Wine said he and his wife were not being allowed to leave their home by soldiers.\n\"Nobody is allowed to leave or come into our house. Also, all journalists - local and international - have been blocked from accessing me here at home,\" he said.\nDozens of people were killed during violence in the run-up to the election. Opposition politicians have also accused the government of harassment.\nThe result gives President Museveni a sixth term in office. The 76-year-old, in power since 1986, says he represents stability in the country.\nMeanwhile, Bobi Wine - the stage name for 38-year-old Robert Kyagulanyi - says he has the backing of the youth in one of the world's youngest nations, where the median age is 16.\nWhat's the latest on the election results?\n\"The electoral commission declares Yoweri Museveni... elected President of the Republic of Uganda,\" election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said on Saturday.\nHe said turnout was 57% of the almost 18 million registered voters.\nEarlier, Mr Byabakama said the vote had been peaceful, and called on Bobi Wine to make public the evidence for his fraud allegations.\nThe opposition candidate earlier said: \"I will be happy to share the videos of all the fraud and irregularities as soon as the internet is restored.\"\nBut speaking after being declared the winner, Mr Museveni said: \"Voting by machines made sure there is no cheating.\n\"But we are going to audit and see how many people voted by fingerprints and how many of those voted by just using the register.\"\nMr Museveni also warned that \"foreign meddling will not be tolerated\".\nThe EU, United Nations and several rights groups have raised concerns. Aside from an African Union mission, no major international group monitored the vote.\nEarlier this week the US - a major aid donor to Uganda - cancelled its diplomatic observer mission to the country, saying that the majority of its staff had been denied permission to monitor polling sites.\nThe US state department said the vote occurred in \"an environment of intimidation of fear\".\nBobi Wine will continue to play a role\nBy Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Kampala\nPresident Yoweri Museveni has seen off countless challengers during his three decades in power - helped along by constitutional changes, which have allowed him to continue running for office.\nHis assurances of security and economic stability continue to win him votes. It's easy to underestimate how much the memories of decades of civil war and a failed state still cast a shadow over this country.\nBobi Wine rejects the results and says he will present evidence of rigging and voter intimidation. The opposition leader casts a lonely figure - in his home on the outskirts of Kampala.\nHis key advisers have either been arrested or are in hiding. Nevertheless, he will continue to play a key role in Uganda's politics.\nHis National Unity Platform is expected to be the biggest opposition party in parliament. What he says and does can inspire millions both in Uganda and across Africa where youthful political movements are taking hold.\nWho is Yoweri Museveni?\nMr Museveni, who came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986, stood as leader of the National Resistance Movement (NRM).\nHe has long been depicted to Ugandans as a liberator and peace bringer.\nBut he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents, says the BBC's Patience Atuhaire.\nWho is Bobi Wine?",

        "content": "The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, extended his 30-year rule on Saturday amid deep controversy as his main opponent was placed under house arrest and international observers dismissed the election result as a sham.\nMuseveni, one of Africas longest-serving leaders, won 60.8% of the vote in presidential elections, while the main opposition candidate, Kizza Besigye, secured 35.4%, according to the countrys electoral commission. Demanding an independent audit of the results, Besigye said: We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda.\nThe opposition politician also revealed that he had been placed under house arrest. A Reuters reporter confirmed that Besigyes house was encircled by police in riot gear and that the media was barred from approaching it.\nMuseveni, 71, has presided over robust economic growth, but has faced mounting accusations at home and abroad of cracking down on dissent and failing to tackle rampant corruption in the east African nation of 37 million people.\nMusevenis ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party hailed the veteran leaders victory as proof that opponents failed to offer any alternative apart from empty promises. The NRM also urged all candidates to respect the will of the people and the authority of the electoral commission and accept the result. We ask all Ugandans to remain calm and peaceful and not to engage in any public disruptions.\nEarlier, however, European and Commonwealth observers criticised the handling of the election, which was marred by lengthy delays in the delivery of polling materials, outbreaks of violence and a government shutdown of social media, which is still in place.\nThe EU observer mission said Thursdays election had been conducted in an intimidating atmosphere, while Commonwealth observers felt that the poll fell short of meeting some key democratic benchmarks.\nEduard Kukan, chief observer for the EU mission, told reporters in Kampala that the poll had been undermined by a lack of transparency and independence at the Ugandan electoral commission. State actors created an intimidating atmosphere for both voters and candidates, he added.\nEven before the results were announced, police encircled the headquarters of the FDC opposition party on Friday as Besigye, 59, met members. After Besigyes arrest on Friday, his supporters took to the streets, prompting riot police to fire teargas and stun grenades at them, as well as warning shots from automatic rifles.\nBesigyes party is alleging that widespread vote-rigging took place and accuses the government of deliberately stalling the voting in opposition strongholds in Kampala and the neighbouring Wakiso district.\nAlthough Museveni brought calm and stability to Uganda after decades of chaos at the hands of Idi Amin and Milton Obote, many opposition voters accuse the former guerrilla fighter of becoming increasingly autocratic and wanting to rule for life.\nThe opposition had tried to tap into mounting anger among young voters, especially in urban areas, where unemployment is high and many are frustrated by the poor state of schools and hospitals.\nThe result angered those who felt that Besigye, the former prime minister and confidant of Museveni until a few months ago, would emerge triumphant. We are disappointed, the election has been rigged, said 23-year-old Brenda in Kampala, who refused to give her second name due to fears for her safety. I have never seen another president and it seems it will be like that until he dies.\nIn an interview with the Observer, Besigye described Musevenis attacks on the opposition as those of a man who did not envisage ever leaving power.\nMuseveni, who was running in his fifth presidential election, came to power in 1986 after waging a 10-year guerrilla war. His regime has seen remarkable strides in the fight against HIV/Aids, an end to active conflict in most parts of the country, and economic growth fuelled by liberalisation and direct foreign investment, although many of these gains have gone into reverse in the last decade.",

However, we've found no evidence to support the claim that it was taken at a beauty contest.\nThe earliest internet postings of the photo we could find came in articles concerning the early days of swimsuit fashion.

Central Europe around 1910.\"\nTrumble wrote:\nLast evening over an early dinner in New York a dear old friend visiting from Australia gave me this postcard which he found lately in a museum bookshop in Germany. The caption reads Schner durch Streifen. Mitteleuropa um 1910. The first phrase is difficult to translate with equal concision, but surely means [men made more] beautiful by stripes, and presumably therefore drips with irony.\nWhile we've yet to see the back of this postcard, Trumble's account is supported by the fact that this same image is available via Winkler Postkarten, a German website that sells old postcards, under the same German caption: \"Schner durch Streifen Mitteleuropa um 1910.\"\nThe claim that this photo shows a \"men's beauty contest in 1919\" doesn't appear to be based on any evidence. It seems that this caption was simply attached to this image (around August 2020) in order to make it a more shareworthy piece of media. As far as we can tell, however, the men in this photo weren't participating in any beauty contests. The photo simply shows six men in striped bathing suits somewhere in central Europe circa 1910.",

        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Donald Trump (or his administration) has the legal authority to designate antifa as a terrorist organization.\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on May 31, 2020, that the United States would be designating \"ANTIFA\" as a \"Terrorist Organization.\"\nTrump's tweet appeared in response to growing protests after the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck on May 25:\nTrump and several top officials, including U.S. Attorney General William Barr, have been blaming, without evidence, antifa and other groups they call \"agitators\" for the protests that have taken over cities across the United States. Barr also said in a statement that \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\nBut the United States currently does not have a process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations, which makes Trump's ability to enforce such a designation highly unlikely.\nAntifa, short for anti-fascist, is an amorphous movement of people who are opposed to fascism. They do not comprise an organized group, do not have a visible leadership, and acknowledge that they are secretive, so it is impossible to know how many people even count themselves as members. Anti-fascists lean strongly toward the left of the political spectrum, and many of them refer to themselves as socialists, anarchists, communists, or anti-capitalists. The positions of various antifa groups can also be difficult to define, but many of them support oppressed community members and protest against amassing of wealth by corporations.\nSome antifa movements date their origins to the battle against European fascism in the 1920s and '30s. The BBC cited Mark Bray, the author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" as an authority in noting that \"[Bray] says the modern American Antifa movement began in the 1980s with a group called Anti-Racist Action. Its members confronted neo-Nazi skinheads at punk gigs in the American Midwest and elsewhere. By the early 2000s the Antifa movement was mostly dormant -- until the rise of Donald Trump and the alt-right.\"\nAntifa groups are not monolithic and employ a range of tactics. Many condemn the use of violence, but according to BBC News, some groups engage in aggressive confrontations, especially with far-right groups on the streets. Extreme factions have carried pepper spray, bricks, knives, and chains with them.\nTrump claimed members of the movement were responsible for acts of vandalism during the May and June 2020 protests against police brutality in the U.S., but in at least one case a white supremacist group was found to have posed as antifa on Twitter. Groups associated with both right and left, not just antifa, are being accused of inciting violence and looting during the protests. In most cases it is difficult to ascertain that antifa is solely responsible for the lawless activities occurring at some protests, and the culprits are still being investigated, as Keith Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, observed on NBC's \"Meet the Press\":\n\"The truth is, nobody really knows ...Theres been a lot of videotape taken by demonstrators of people who are very suspicious, who really did start breaking windows ... There have been other photographs of cars with no license plates. Very suspicious behavior.\nIt would all have to be investigated, he said.\nWithout any official structure to the group, or much evidence linking antifa to specific acts of violence, it would be difficult to prove that that body of activists is behind anything, Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security program, said: \"As far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure ... Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\"\nTrump's ability to designate anti-fascists as a terrorist group is also highly suspect given that only foreign groups can be labeled as \"terrorist\" organizations under U.S. law, and \"domestic terrorism\" is not currently a federal crime in the U.S., according to the New York Times:\nA federal law defines terrorism as crimes of violence that are intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government policy. But it distinguishes between international terrorism, which must have a foreign or transnational nexus, and domestic terrorism, which occurs primarily on American soil.\nActs of terrorism transcending national boundaries is a federal crime, giving the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors jurisdiction to take the lead. There is no equivalent crime of domestic terrorism, so law enforcement officials deal with such offenses using other laws that do not have terrorism in their labels, such as the state-level crime of murder.\nA 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) on domestic terrorism similarly stated that:\nThe federal government does not generate an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations or individuals. The development of such a list may be precluded by civil liberties concerns (i.e., inclusion in a publicly available list may impinge on a groups exercise of free speech or its other constitutionally protected activities). However, a lack of official lists or processes to designate groups or individuals as domestic terrorists makes it difficult to assess domestic terrorism trends and evaluate federal efforts to counter such threats. In 2011, an unnamed [Department of Homeland Security] official cited in a news report stated that unlike international terrorism, there are no designated domestic terrorist groups. Subsequently, all the legal actions of an identified extremist group leading up to an act of violence are constitutionally protected and not reported on by DHS.\nThe CRS report also noted that although the U.S. does not officially designate domestic terror organizations, it does record individual terrorists and threats in its Terrorist Screening Database:\nWhile the government does not provide an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does include domestic terrorists (along with international terrorists) in its Terrorist Screening Database, commonly known as the Terrorist Watchlist ...\nWhile not naming specific groups, DOJ and the FBI have openly delineated domestic terrorist threats. DOJ has identified domestic terrorism threats to include criminal activity by animal rights extremists, ecoterrorists, anarchists, antigovernment extremists such as sovereign citizens and unauthorized militias, black separatists, white supremacists, and abortion extremists.\nIn an interview with Snopes, Patel said that a number of different crimes can be designated as acts of terrorism:\nThere is no single crime of either domestic or international terrorism. But both types of terrorism can be prosecuted under a number of statutes which constitute crimes of terrorism. The crime of hijacking an airplane, for example, is an act of terrorism. In fact, the government has available 51 different criminal statutes which can be applied domestic terrorism. It does not  and should not  have the ability to designate a domestic organization. This would allow the government to target political activity as terrorism, which is exactly what the White House and the Justice Department are trying to do by threatening to go after protestors under the guise of targeting Antifa.\nThe State Department makes a list of designated \"Foreign Terrorist Organizations\" (FTO) available on their website. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), enforcing the terrorist designation for FTOs involves blocking assets, prosecuting individuals, and imposing immigration restrictions on FTOs, their members, and their supporters.\nPatel added that the Secretary of State can designate foreign terrorist groups, but this triggers a range of consequences: \"most important of which is the ability to prosecute anyone who provides the group with material support, no matter how minimal. In addition property and assets of persons linked to terrorism can be blocked, but only under a law that requires a connection to a mainly foreign threat.\"\nThus, as a large, decentralized entity with no infrastructure or assets that we know of, designating and targeting antifa as a domestic terrorist organization could, according to some experts, create a dangerous scenario, as Patel told us:\nIf persons who identified as 'Antifa' suspected of committing crimes that violate any of the federal crimes of terrorism or other criminal they could of course be properly investigated and prosecuted. The FBI has more than ample authority to investigate individuals they suspect of being engaged in criminal activity. The problem is the FBI's rules are so loose they can also investigate people who are not suspected of criminal activity, so these powers are easily abused. The FBI has a long history of investigating environmentalists and anti-war activists and recently fabricated a new terrorist threat of black identity extremists and it would be altogether surprising if they didnt spy on the protestors.\nThe paucity of evidence directly connecting antifa to acts violence during protests, combined with the structureless nature of the group and the fact that the U.S. currently has no legal process for designating domestic terrorist organizations, leads us to rate this claim as \"False.\"",

Floyd pleaded that he couldnt breathe. Protesters across the country for several days have chanted calls for justice for Floyd. Some people have looted stores and set police cars and other property on fire.\nTrump and allies say that a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups are anarchists and responsible for the destruction. \"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,\" Trump tweeted May 31.\nIts not an established fact that antifa supporters are the ones  or only the ones  looting or destroying property. Other groups are also under suspicion. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said on May 30 that \"largely peaceful protests\" have turned to \"outright looting and domestic terrorism in our region.\" He added: \"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.\"\nPolitiFact decided to examine the legal grounds for Trumps statement of designating antifa as a terrorist organization. National security experts said there is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. Also, antifa isnt an organization with an official leader or membership.\nTrumps statement \"is somewhat of an empty threat,\" said Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justices Liberty & National Security Program.\nIf the Trump administration sought a way to make that designation, its likely to be challenged in court, experts said. \"He has previously issued executive orders that weren't likely to survive legal challenge, so the lack of authority for such a designation may not stop him,\" German said.\nRELATED: The death of George Floyd: What you need to know\nWhat is antifa?\nAntifa is a term used for a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times resorting to violence. The antifa movement goes back decades, but regained attention after antifa groups counterprotested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\nAntifa is not an organization with an official membership, leader, or base for operations. So when Trump said he would designate antifa as a terrorist organization, its unclear who exactly his administration would be targeting or what kind of consequences that label would carry. The White House did not respond to our request for information.\nThe State Department and Treasury Department make designations to the Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, but there is no equivalent government list for domestic terrorist organizations.\nWhen the government designates a person or group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, its members are inadmissible to the United States, and their assets and money in the United States are frozen so they dont have access to it.\n\"There is a process to designate international groups as foreign terrorist organizations, but Trump is clearly directing his ire toward local activists, not anyone involved in anti-fascist organizing abroad,\" German said. \"Antifa isnt organized in that fashion in the first place, as it has no leaders, assets, or infrastructure, so banning material support to foreign anti-fascist groups would have little legitimate anti-terrorism effect here or abroad.\"\nAttorney General Bill Barr in a May 31 statement said, \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\"Domestic terrorism\" is defined in federal law, but the term itself does not exist as a federal crime. In domestic terrorism investigations, prosecutors end up charging suspects with offenses such as hate crimes, murder or weapons violations.\nFederal law defines domestic terrorism as acts dangerous to human life that violate the criminal laws of the United States or of any state, and which appear to be intended to:\n intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\n affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\nThe FBI adds ideology into its definition for domestic terrorism: violent, criminal acts \"to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\"\nReporters on June 1 asked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany what legal authority Trump would use to designate antifa as a terrorist organization and how members of antifa would be identified.\nMcEnany did not directly answer the question.",

Appearing on Fox News, he described the rioters as \"Antifa-like\", but stressed it \"remains to be seen exactly how\" the peaceful protests took a sinister turn.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he had evidence that people from outside Minneapolis were involved in acts of violence in the state. He did not explain if these people were aligned with any groups or political beliefs in particular.\nOthers, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have pointed the finger at outsiders on the right wing of politics.\n\"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organised crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilise our city and our region,\" Frey tweeted on Saturday.\nHowever on Sunday, authorities in Minnesota said people from out of the state represented about 20% of Saturday's arrests.\nWhat is Antifa?\nAntifa - short for anti-fascist action - is a protest movement that strongly opposes neo-Nazis, fascism, white supremacists and racism.

        "content": "As some nationwide protests have turned violent, President Donald Trump pointed to the anti-fascist movement antifa, claiming: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. But there is no such official federal designation for domestic terrorism organizations.\nExperts cited other reasons a designation  even if it were made possible  would be difficult or questionable. Antifa isnt one organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left militant anti-fascism groups.\nJames J.F. Forest, professor in the University of Massachusetts Lowells School of Criminology and Justice Studies, told us in an email. So, imagine the difficulty a prosecutor would face in a court of law proving beyond a reasonable doubt an individual was a member of ANTIFA.\nAs far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure, Faiza Patel, director of the liberty & national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told us in an interview. Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\nProtests against police brutality and racial injustice have erupted in cities across the country following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, after a Minneapolis police officer, who is white, kneeled on his neck for several minutes, as shown in a video of the arrest.\nSome of those protests have turned violent, with businesses looted and fires set. Trump, and others in the administration, have blamed antifa and the Radical Left, as Trump put it, though state and federal officials have pointed to various groups or outsiders generally. The violence and vandalism is being led by antifa and other radical left-wing groups, the president said on May 30.\nThe next day, Trump made his statement about designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\nNo Domestic Terrorist Designation\nTheres no legal process or meaning for what the president said, Patel told us. Hes reflecting on the process that we use for foreign terrorist organizations.\nThe secretary of state has the legal authority to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations under federal law. The federal government makes those FTO designations through a six-step process involving the State Department and other agencies. The designations enable the federal government to freeze assets, prosecute individuals for aiding those groups and restrict immigration for members of those groups, as the Government Accountability Office explains.\n[W]e have federal criminal statutes regarding Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, but no equivalent for domestic terrorism, Forest told us. As an example, Timothy McVeigh was prosecuted in federal court for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing under a federal law addressing weapons of mass destruction because the ideology that motivated his attack was not connected to any foreign entity.\nIf there were a domestic terrorist designation, Patel said, it would undoubtedly face a First Amendment challenge, which is likely to succeed.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service also explained in a 2017 report that the federal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations. In other words, there is no official open-source roster of domestic groups that the FBI or other federal agencies target as terrorist organizations.\nIt, too, cited concerns about infringing on First Amendment freedoms if a domestic terrorist designation were possible. Such a list might discourage speech and expression related to the ideologies underpinning the activities of named groups, the CRS report said.\nMary McCord, legal director at Georgetown University Law Centers Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former Department of Justice official, and Hina Shamsi, the American Civil Liberties Unions national security project director, made similar statements to the press. No current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns, McCord said.\nWe asked the White House about the presidents tweet but we havent received a response.\nOn the same day as Trumps statement, Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement: The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\nBarrs language isnt an official designation but could indicate the resources the Department of Justice and FBI are going to put into investigating a particular threat, Patel said. She noted that the FBI has long history of targeting protest groups and said she would be very worried that by targeting antifa, an amorphous term, the Justice Department would actually be infiltrating and targeting legitimate protest activity.\nThe CRS report said that while theres no domestic terrorist designation, the DOJ and FBI have publicly named and discussed domestic terrorism threatssuch as animal rights extremism or anarchist extremismwithout illuminating exactly how they arrive at these categories.\nForest said the court cases against those individuals relied on laws against sabotage, vandalism, harassment, et al  but not domestic terrorism. The language about such threats can also indicate what resources and priority groups would receive from the DOJ. Technically, the FBI cant really gain any law enforcement tools it didnt already have simply by calling something a terrorist threat, Forest said.\nPatel said the FBI calling a group a threat was mostly language but could also reflect what resources theyre going to devote to an issue. When we call something terrorism, she said, were suggesting its something very serious.\nAlso, Forest said there are sentencing enhancements for terrorism-related acts that could bring added prison time to a conviction.\nSome experts have argued Congress should enact a law to make domestic terrorism a federal offense.\nMcCord and Jason M. Blazakis, director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, wrote in the Lawfare blog on Feb. 27, 2019 that designation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies. But making it a crime to materially support domestic terrorism  just as its a federal crime to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization  does not raise the same concerns.\nPatel, however, has argued the opposite. After House lawmakers, spurred into action by deadly white nationalists attacks, introduced legislation to make domestic terrorism a federal crime, she wrote, in October 2019, that such a law was both unnecessary and creates serious risks of abuse.\nThe FBI already has all the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of white nationalist violence, Patel said.\nUnclear What Groups Have Incited Violence\nTrump, Barr and National Security Adviser Robert OBrien have pointed to antifa as driving or leading the violent acts that have erupted in some protests. We asked the White House if it could point to evidence of that, but we havent received a response. Various government officials have blamed different groups, or said they didnt know who was behind it.\nIn a May 30 tweet, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the city was now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.\nMark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, wrote in the Washington Post that he suspects some members of antifa groups have been involved in the protests but there arent enough of them to lead nationwide destruction tactics.\n[A]ntifa itself is not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity, Bray said.\nBased on my research into antifa groups, I believe its true that most, if not all, members do wholeheartedly support militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it this week. Im also confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance during this dramatic rebellion, he wrote. Yet it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups because members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right, and concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small. Basically, there are nowhere near enough anarchists and members of antifa groups to have accomplished such breathtaking destruction on their own.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked about Barrs statement that it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left-extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, said the truth is nobody really knows. He said on NBCs Meet the Press on May 31 that there had been very suspicious behavior, including cars with no license plates.\nIve talked to people who are demonstrating, some of them say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota. And they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it, Ellison said.\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said those cities were investigating who was responsible for the violence. Were working to get to the bottom of that right now, Carter said on CBS Face the Nation.\nIt looked differently racially in our city than our normal protests looked, Bottoms said on the same show. And it was  it was just it was a different group. So we dont know who they were, but many of them were not locally based.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will designate antifa as a terrorist organization after Democratic and Republican officials pointed to extremist groups and out of town demonstrators as responsible for violent episodes at protests in major cities across the country.\nTrump and Attorney General William Barr had earlier pointed to anti-fascist organizers and anarchists as culprits behind the mayhem following the death of a 46-year-old black man, George Floyd, at the hands of Minneapolis police. Others said right-wing extremists such as Boogaloo followers, who hope to bring about a second Civil War, were pushing for such uprising in the protests.\nIn a Sunday statement, Barr said the Justice Department is taking aim at \"apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest and are engaged in violations of federal law.\"\nThe attorney general said that \"to identify criminal organizers and instigators,\" federal law enforcement officials are utilizing \"our existing network of 56 regional FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces.\"\n\"Preventing reconciliation and driving us apart is the goal of these radical groups, and we cannot let them succeed,\" Barr added. \"The violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\nThere is no domestic terrorism statute and legal authority for the U.S. to designate any domestic organization as a terrorist group, as the Justice Department's domestic terrorism coordinator has said publicly on multiple occasions in recent years. A 2018 Congressional Review Service report on antifa said that \"presumably\" the FBI \"would investigate antifa followers suspected of criminal activity as domestic terrorists, categorizing them as a type of anarchist extremist.\"\n\"As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused,\" American Civil Liberties Union National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said in response to Trump's post. \"There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.\"\nThe Trump administration also took aim at antifa during the Sunday political talk shows. Speaking with CNN's \"State of the Union,\" national security adviser Robert O'Brien said violence \"is being driven by antifa.\"\n\"And they did it in Seattle. They have done it in Portland. They have done it in Berkeley. This is a destructive force of radical  I don't even know if we want to call them leftists,\" O'Brien continued. \"Whatever they are, they're  they're militants who are coming in and burning our cities, and we're going to get to the bottom of it.\"\nAntifa, meaning \"anti-fascist,\" is a coalition of protesters, left-wing activists and self-described anarchists who seek to physically confront and bring down what they deem as the far right. Trump and his administration have long targeted the loosely affiliated group, which has made its presence felt at protests throughout his presidency.\nO'Brien called for the FBI to engage in surveillance of antifa and to prosecute its members.\n\"And if they haven't been doing that, we need a plan right away to make sure that happens,\" O'Brien told reporters after appearing in the Sunday shows. \"I think the attorney general has already been in touch with (FBI) Director Wray, and I think the President wants to know what the FBI has been doing, and what their plan is going forward, and if they haven't been doing anything about antifa.\"\nO'Brien said that while he condemns \"all extremists,\" he pinned the violence on left-wing radicals.\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted the \"big story\" being missed is that in \"city after city we have a rogues gallery of terrorists from Antifa to 'Boogaloo' groups encouraging & committing violence.\"\n\"They may not be ideologically compatible but share a hatred of govt & police & are taking advantage of the protests,\" Rubio, acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, added, saying the demonstrators \"don't fit a simple left vs. right identity.\"\nThese individuals want to \"tear the whole system down even if it requires a new civil war, Rubio said.\nThe protests began last week after a video showed Minneapolis police officers pinning Floyd to the ground as he exclaimed that he could not breathe. One officer, Derek Chauvin, was seen holding his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as he begged for mercy  with Chauvin continuing to pin Floyd down even after he became unresponsive.\nChauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were also involved in Floyd's detainment. They have not been charged with any crimes stemming from the incident.\nThe protests ratcheted up over the weekend after demonstrations became violent in Minnesota. Peaceful protests across the country became increasingly tense as night fell upon cities this weekend, with fires breaking out in many of them. Meanwhile, police at the protests have been recorded using harsh force against demonstrators and journalists.\nMelvin Carter, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, told \"State of the Union\" that some of the protesters are driven \"by a passion for our community, by a love for our community, and by a deep desire to never see a loss of life like the killing on the video, the killing of George Floyd we all saw this week.\"\n\"Then there's folks in the street who are there to burn down our black-owned barbershops, to burn down our family-owned businesses, to burn down our immigrant-owned restaurants and it is very clear to me those people are not driven by a love for our community,\" Carter said. \"And there is no way you can argue those actions are designed to produce a better future for our community, quite the opposite.\"\nCarter had apologized Saturday after saying that \"every person\" arrested in the protests were from out of state, saying he was given inaccurate information during a police briefing. Local media examined local jail data that found nearly all of the people arrested at the protests live in Minneapolis or the surrounding metropolitan area.\nOther top officials in Minnesota, like Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, had said out-of-staters were responsible for some of the looting and arson.\nSpeaking with NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, said he's become aware of \"very suspicious\" people taking part in the demonstrations through video recordings made at the protests.\n\"The truth is, nobody really knows,\" he said of who is responsible for the more violent activity. \"I talked to people who were demonstrating, they say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota. And they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it.\"\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., pointed to Walz's comments on out-of-towners in an interview with \"This Week.\"\n\"Lets have a look at what really is happening, who is making what, taking what actions,\" Pelosi said. \"But we should not ignore the fact that there is a room for peaceful protests in all of this.\"\nAlso on \"This Week,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said the large Floyd protests are happening because people \"want bold and systematic change to take place, so that they can feel like their voices are heard.\"\n\"This is what happens when people are tired, just marching every single day, just to have their humanity be recognized,\" she said. \"In Minneapolis, we have marched. We have protested. We have organized. And when we see people setting our buildings and our businesses ablaze, we know those are not people who are interested in protecting black lives.\"",

Adam Schiff (D-California) \"used taxpayer money\" to cover up a sexual-harassment accusation:\nIt's unclear where the rumor started, but on Twitter it was sometimes shared in association with a clearly bogus article from the junk news site TheNetSpies.com. That site is filled with obviously false information, and its \"About\" page states that \"If you like our reporting, kick up your feet, partake of your favorite intoxicant(s) and stay a while. If not, go ask your mommy to come down to the basement and nurse her 33 year old wuss.\"\nOn 11 February 2018, TheNetSpies.com published an article for which they alleged to have interviewed Los Angeles Times former Assistant Managing Editor Christina Bellantoni (which TheNetSpies misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). Bellantoni, they asserted, told the tale of a hapless (but non-existent) man named Will Bottom, who claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff, his \"gay lover.\" To illustrate this supposedly abusive relationship, the article repurposed an image of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn, New York, man who suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked and beaten in 2013.\nThe real Christina Bellantoni never spoke to anyone from TheNetSpies and took to Twitter to make it clear the story was falsified:\nThis isn't the only unfounded rumor to dog Schiff, who became chair of the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",

        "content": "Claim:\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla refused to take the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\nIn March and April 2021, widely shared social media posts falsely claimed that Albert Bourla, the Greek CEO of the pharmaceutical multinational company Pfizer, had refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine produced by his own company, in collaboration with the German company BioNTech. Anti-vaccine commentators and COVID-19 conspiracy theorists seized upon this purported admission as evidence that the vaccine was, in fact, harmful.\nOn March 24, the Facebook page Tru York, which routinely posts baseless and potentially dangerous misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, published a video with the banner headline \"PFEIZER [sic] CEO REFUSES VACCINE.\" The video contained a short clip of Bourla, in a television interview, responding to a question about when he himself intended to receive the vaccine. Bourla is shown saying:\n\"The sooner I can, I will. The only sensitivity here, Meg, is that I don't want to have an example that I'm cutting the line, that I'm 59 years old, in good health, I'm not working in the front line. So my type is not recommended to get [the] vaccination now. So that's one consideration.\"\nAlongside the video, social media users also shared memes that claimed Bourla had \"refused\" to take Pfizer's own COVID-19 vaccine. The caption on the video shared by Tru York was false and misleading in two principle ways.\nFirstly, the footage itself does not show Bourla refusing to take the vaccine. Rather, he expresses enthusiasm about that prospect (\"The sooner I can, I will\"), but explains the understandable position that he hadn't yet taken it because he wanted to avoid the appearance of using his position of privilege to take the vaccine ahead of older and more medically vulnerable individuals.\nSecondly, the interview in question was recorded months earlier, and Bourla had in fact taken the vaccine by the time Tru York published the video, and other social media users posted similar memes.\nIn an interview with Axios reporter Caitlin Owens, broadcast on HBO on March 7, Bourla said he had received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine around three weeks earlier, meaning some time in February 2021. In a tweet on March 10, Bourla posted a photograph of himself receiving what he described as the second dose:\nThe Tru York video was therefore posted two weeks after Bourla went on record as having received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. By contrast, the interview footage in which Bourla explained why he had not yet received the vaccine, but was looking forward to doing so, was actually recorded three months earlier.\nThat interview was broadcast by CNBC's Squawk Box on Dec. 14, 2020, and can be viewed below. Interviewer Meg Tirrell asked Bourla \"I've heard you have not yet had your shot. When do you plan to get it?\" Bourla's response is worth including in full, because he offers a more in-depth explanation of the dilemma of when to take the vaccine than what was included in the subsequent Tru York video:\nThe sooner I can, I will. The only sensitivity here, Meg, is that I don't want to have an example that I'm cutting the line, that I'm 59 years old, in good health, I'm not working in the front line. So my type is not recommended to get [the] vaccination now. So that's one consideration. On the other hand, our company [has] run a lot of polls to see what would take people to believe it. And one of the highest-ranking [responses], even higher than if Joe Biden takes it, even higher than if other presidents take it, is if the CEO of the company takes it.\nSo with that it mind, I'm trying to find a way that I will get vaccinated, [even] if it is not my time, just to demonstrate the confidence of the company. But we have made a decision that if we have to do that, we will not do it with our executives, so none of the executives or board members would cut the line  they would take it as their age and occupation type  it's time for them to take [it].",

The ad hinted at a fall from grace: \"Once a Hollywood Legend, Now Working a Regular Job.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a 39-page slideshow article on the website Loan Pride. Its headline read, \"Former Stars Who Now Work a Regular 9-5 Job.\"\nThe pictures from the ad did not show Cameron Diaz now working a \"regular 9-5 job.\" US Weekly reported that the photographs simply showed her \"leaving a friend's home.\"\nFurther, she does not work a 9-to-5 job at all. She appeared on page 39, the final page of the misleading story:\nRetired actress Cameron Diaz has had a fantastic career in Hollywood and has gained several awards for her performances. She has been graced with a New York Film Critics Award, four Golden Globe Award nominations, and three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. She landed her first major role when she was only 21 and appeared in the comedy film \"The Mask\" alongside Jim Carrey. She has mostly acted in comedy films such as \"The Other Woman,\" \"Bad Teacher,\" and others. Devoting her time to writing, Diaz has already published two health books titles \"The Body Book\" and \"The Longevity Book.\" The former was a New York Times bestseller.\nHer work as an author wasn't her only pursuit after leaving acting. In July 2020, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that she and her friend Katherine Power launched a \"clean wine\" company called Avaline. The Chronicle also said she \"spent the last decade building herself into a lifestyle and wellness guru.\"\nIn August 2020, Good Morning America reported that Diaz walked away from her movie career so she could find \"peace.\"\nDuring the Aug. 5 installment of \"In Goop Health: The Sessions,\" Diaz, 47, sat down with Gwyneth Paltrow, also 47, and revealed she came to the realization she needed to call it quits when she turned 40.\n\"I stopped and really looked at my life,\" she told Paltrow. \"When youre making a movie ... they own you. Youre there for 12 hours a day for months on end, you have no time for anything else.\"\n\"I realized I handed off parts of my life to all these other people,\" the 'Charlie's Angels' star added. \"I had to basically take it back and take responsibility for my own life. I had been going so hard for so long, working, making films, such a grind. I didnt make any space for my personal life.\"\nThe life-changing move has only had positive effects on Diaz, who admitted that walking away from her movie career has brought her \"peace.\"\nIn sum, Diaz is now retired from acting. Pictures in an ad did not show her working a \"regular 9-5 job.\" She also didn't have such a day job to begin with. She is an author, started a wine brand, and has a family. In December 2019, she and her husband, musician Benji Madden, welcomed a baby daughter.\nWe previously reported on a similar misleading story about former child actor Amanda Bynes.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 12 weeks.\nProvisional death counts may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Our counts often track 12 weeks behind other data for a number of reasons: Death certificates take time to be completed. There are many steps involved in completing and submitting a death certificate. Waiting for test results can create additional delays. States report at different rates. Currently, 63% of all U.S. deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, but there is significant variation among jurisdictions. It takes extra time to code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded manually, which takes an average of 7 days. Other reporting systems use different definitions or methods for counting deaths.\nThat 37,308 was not a drastic downward revision of any previously reported death total. Rather, it only might have seemed such because it was mistakenly compared to the number of deaths reported on the CDC's COVID-19 Cases in the U.S. page, which as of May 3, 2020, displayed a total of 65,735 deaths:\nWhy such a large discrepancy? Because as latter page's \"About the Data\" section explains, its data are updated daily based on \"Case notifications received by CDC from U.S. public health jurisdictions and the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)\" and includes \"both confirmed and probable deaths.\" This more up-to-date page will obviously report higher death figures that one whose data lag by 1-2 weeks.\nIndeed, two weeks earlier, the \"Cases in the U.S.\" page had displayed a total of 35,443 deaths, a number much closer to the 37,308 figure reported by the \"Provisional Death Counts\" with its 1-2 week data lag.\nIn short, this claim is like comparing stock prices from a two-week-old newspaper with those offered today by a cable news station, and then attributing any differences to a conspiracy rather than the mere passage of time as reflected in more current reporting.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows an official road sign in Arizona warning drivers about parachuting cows.\nIn March 2021, a picture was circulated on social media that supposedly showed a sign on the side of a rural road warning drivers about airborne cattle. Actor Jason Alexander was one social media user who shared this picture along with a few questions about its origins:\nIs this sign warning drivers about parachuting cows? Is that a UFO in the process of abducting an unsuspecting bovine?\nAs far as we can tell, this photograph was taken somewhere in Arizona. In 2019, the Tucson news station KVOA posted a similar picture and reported that a handful of these \"unique warning signs\" had been spotted across southern Arizona:\nWhile this appears to be a genuine photograph of a road sign in Arizona, it is not an official road sign sanctioned by the Arizona Department of Transportation. Doug Nick, the Assistant Communications Director for Public Information for ADOT, confirmed to us that this was not an ADOT-produced sign, but noted that the gravel road shown in this image may not be maintained by the state's department of transportation.\nWhile ADOT could not confirm specifics about this sign, Nick assured us that parachuting cows were not a problem in the state. Nick noted, for instance, that cows lack the opposable thumbs necessary to pull a ripcord.\nPersonally, I have lived here all of my life and have yet to see a parachuting cow or other livestock for that matter.\nI'm not a pilot, but I would imagine that the logistical challenges of herding cattle into an aircraft, strapping a parachute on them and releasing them to plummet to the earth at tremendous speed would be daunting, at least.\nThen there's the vexing problem of the ethos that \"you pack your own chute.\" That's a sensible protocol for, say, the 101st Airborne. But as cattle have no opposable thumbs, this too becomes an insurmountable challenge and also raises the question of how a heifer, bull or steer would pull the ripcord while racing headlong (horn long)? into terra firma.\nOf course, the stereotypical cartoon image of the desert often involves the presence of a cattle skull resting near a bush or a cactus. That tableau is conceivable, but we seriously doubt any of those cattle deaths were the result of rapid deceleration blunt force trauma to an erstwhile airborne bovine.\nWhile parachuting cows may not be a known problem in the state, Arizona DOT does have an official road sign to warn drivers about ground-based cattle. The official sign features the same black cow as shown in the picture above, minus the UFO / parachute.\nHere's an example of the real Arizona cow sign:\nThe parachuting cow sign is, oddly enough, not the first such sign to grace the roads of Arizona. Here's a picture from photographer Tom Story showing a slightly different design of an unofficial Arizona road sign:\nStory wrote on Instagram that this photograph was taken near an airport in Coolidge, Arizona, sometime in the 1980s. The airport, according to Story, was an \"international center for skydiving for several decades.\" It seems plausible that some skydiver found the idea of a parachuting cow to be humorous and altered the sign.\nStory wrote: \"Throwback Thursday to the airport at Coolidge, AZ in the 1980s when this sign was along the road. The airfield was originally an Army Air Corps facility built in the Second World War and was an international center for skydiving for several decades. Scanned from the original color transparency.\"",

We've previously examined false accusations that Thunberg was the \"highest paid activist,\" that she was actually an actress, and that she was once filmed firing a machine gun.\nThunberg did not ask China to \"give up\" chopsticks.\nThis rumor has been circulating since at least January 2020. Although it has taken several forms, we've yet to encounter any social media posts pointing to when or where Thunberg allegedly made this request.\nOne of the earliest postings of this rumor, which was shared by the unverified Twitter account @Geoloong on Jan. 14, included a GIF of Thunberg speaking at the Climate Action Summit in 2019, but Thunberg made no mention of \"chopsticks\" during this speech. We searched other articles, interviews, and speeches delivered by Thunberg around this time and found no record of her asking China to ban chopsticks.\nOther red flags in this post indicate the rumor is little more than an invented anecdote to mock the teenager. For starters, we found that this story was being shared almost exclusively by people expressing a negative view of Thunberg. If this was a genuine quote, you'd expect this story would have been shared (at least initially) by Thunberg's supporters.\nFurthermore, the anecdote described in this post is simply ludicrous. Although it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for Thunberg, a teenager who became Time magazine's youngest Person of the Year for her work addressing climate change, to note the adverse environmental impact of disposable chopsticks, it would be quite extraordinary for the government of the most populous country in the world to issue a juvenile response telling someone not to \"wipe their butt\" because toilet paper is made from trees.\nIf China did issue such a statement, it would have surely been international news. Yet, just as we were unable to find a source for Thunberg's alleged comment, we were unable to find a credible source for China's alleged insult. In fact, the text on the above-displayed meme is a near-verbatim copy of the text published to the humor website Joe.ks.com.\nAlthough Thunberg did not urge China to ban the use of chopsticks, China truly uses millions of trees every year to produce billions of pairs of disposable chopsticks. When concerns about the adverse impact disposable chopsticks had on the environment were raised in 2006, the Chinese government implemented a 5% tax on the utensil in an attempt to slow deforestation.\nBBC News reported:\nThe Chinese government is introducing a 5% tax on disposable wooden chopsticks in a bid to preserve its forests.\nIt produces about 45 billion pairs of chopsticks a year, consuming millions of trees and bamboo plants.\nThe move came as China said it would raise some consumption taxes next month in a bid to help the environment and narrow the gap between rich and poor.",

        "content": "Claim:\nViral text accurately outlines how biotechnology company Moderna is linked to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeffrey Epstein.\nIn mid-2020, the American biotechnology company Moderna received prominent news coverage about their efforts to develop a vaccine to deal with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nAt that time, internet users were circulating a bit of text tying Moderna to infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Hungarian-born financier George Soros, and American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, figures who previously had all been the subjects of various baseless conspiracy theories.\nThe text linking Moderna with all of these public figures and implying they were involved in some nebulous but nefarious plot appeared to have been a completely tongue-in-cheek spoof of groundless conspiracy theories, but many readers who skimmed it at least wondered if it might have at least some substance to it:\nThe vaccine that is coming...\nAs many of you heard Moderna is in stage 3 of their vaccine testing.\nIf all goes well it'll become federal law to get the vaccine.\nHere's something many of you don't know,\nguess who the first CEO of Moderna was?\nA Cornell graduate by the name of Anthony Fauci, who was a roommate with none other than\nBill Gates.\nAre you paying attention?\nIt was at Cornell that Bill Gates designed the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patented it under US2006257852.\nAre you awake yet?\nNow let's really go down the rabbit hole.\nModerna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben.\nIG Farben is infamous for it's mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust.\nAfter Germany fell, IG Farben was dissolved and its assets sold off by a Nazi turned American by the name of, you guessed it, George Soros.\nSoros rebranded the company as Moderna.\nAnd who was the primary stockholder of Moderna until his death?\nJeffrey Epstein.\nHis role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections.\nLet that sink in.\nWake up people!\nYou are being conditioned and controlled.\nFor the \"Is this true?\" record, we note the following:\n1) Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has never been the CEO of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna. Fauci has been the director of NIAID since 1984, while ModeRNA Therapeutics was not founded until 2010. Fauci also graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1966 and therefore could not possibly have been college roommates with technology mogul Bill Gates, who attended Harvard College for a few years in the mid-1970s.\n2) Bill Gates, who did not attend Cornell, also did not design or patent radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips. The first such patent was taken out in 1973 by Mario Cardullo, and the patent number provided in the message text (US2006257852) actually points to a patent related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus rather than any RFID technology.\n3) Notorious chemical and pharmaceutical company IG Farben was not \"dissolved\" after World War II by George Soros, who was not a Nazi (or a German) and was only 14 years old when Germany surrendered in 1945. The victorious Allied powers seized IG Farben's surviving assets and split the firm up into smaller constituent companies.\n4) Financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex offenses in 2008 and committed suicide in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, got his start in the world of finance as a trader at Bear Stearns in 1976 and later founded his own money-management consulting firm, Financial Trust Company.",

Musk did not die in a factory explosion in March 2021.\nWhile these images appear to show headlines from websites such as Fox News, these are not genuine news articles but fake headlines that were never actually published by credible news sites. The latest article about Musk on Fox News, for example, reports on a successful SpaceX Falcon 9 launch, not Musk's death.\nWe are not exactly sure why people started to spread a death hoax about Musk. Some have speculated that it may have been an attempt to manipulate the stock market. One version of this hoax, for instance, was dressed up as an official announcement from Tesla.\nBut this is not a genuine statement from Tesla.\nMusk, the CEO of companies such as Tesla and SpaceX, is one of the richest people in the world. If he truly did die in a factory explosion, news about Musk's death would dominate on just about every news site. Yet we've not seen any credible reports about his death.\nFurthermore, no official statements have been released by Tesla, SpaceX, or on Musk's social media accounts.\nThere is no truth to the reports that Musk died in a Tesla factory explosion. While these images appear to show headlines from websites such as Fox News, these are not genuine news articles.",

        "content": "Claim:\nThe 1990s movie \"Shazaam\" starred comedian Sinbad as a genie.\nOrigin\nA popular internet theory holds that actor David Adkins, better known as the comedian Sinbad, played a genie in a popular children's movie released sometime in the 1990s called \"Shazaam.\"\nThe movie Shazaam, from the 1990s, staring Sinbad was never a real movie. Myself and thousands of others remember watching this movie, but apparently it was never made.\nI've tried looking it up myself and haven't found anything about it. There is an article about the oddity that was on Facebook. Someone commented a screenshot of the vhs in the comments, but again, I could not find this picture on the internet myself.\nAlthough this movie does not actually exist, social media users have circulated an image in an attempt to fool viewers into believing the film is real:\nThe \"genie\" in the above-displayed image actually features the chest and arms of WWE wrestler Chavo Guerrero, with Sinbad's face digitally added to the scene:\nDespite the total lack of evidence that any such film starring Sinbad was ever made  no extant footage, no still shots documenting its creation, no news articles or movie reviews mentioning it, it has no entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and Sinbad himself has stated that he never played a genie in a movie called Shazaam  many people still they remember seeing the movie.\nBut why?\nWhile we cannot pinpoint an exact origin of this collective false memory, several circumstantial aspects suggest why people may mistakenly recall Sinbad's having starred in a genie movie.\nThe name: Depending on when you grew up, the name \"Sinbad\" likely recalls memories of one of two things: either a popular 1990s comedian, or a fictional sailor who had adventures (sometimes involving genies) in the Middle East. It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.\nSinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\" on TNT in 1994:\nKazaam: A simpler explanation is that some fans are misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s that featured a popular actor playing a genie. In 1996, Shaquille O'Neal essayed the role of a genie in the film \"Kazaam\":\nSinbad appeared in several popular childrens' movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for Kazaam was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie The First Kid:\nIt appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of the \"Mandela Effect,\" an informal term for a collective false memory. The term was coined by a woman who discovered that she and hundreds of other people believed, and remembered, that Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s. Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa's first black president and winning the Nobel Peace Prize (along with another former president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, who ended the system of segregation known in South Africa as apartheid during his time in power) in 1993  all of which, of course, would have been impossible if Mandela had been dead for a decade.\nSightings:",

In the scene, Bynes lifts her shirt to prove she's a woman. Her character spent much of the movie pretending to be a boy so that she could play soccer. However, she did not appear topless in the film, despite what was implied by various ads. One ad claimed: \"[Photos] Top 17 Most Paused Movie Moments.\"\nIn January 2021, another online advertisement included the same moment from \"She's the Man.\" It also featured a second picture of Amanda Bynes purportedly now \"working 9-5\" in a product support job. The ad claimed: \"She Was A Super Star, Now She's Working 9-5.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a lengthy slideshow article on Gazillions.com. Its headline read: \"Former Stars Who Now Have Normal Jobs.\" Like the ad with the pictures of Bynes, the page for also said that she worked a job in \"product support.\" The description on the page claimed that she \"returned to work in the support industry.\"\nThis ad and story were both misleading. The photograph was real. It's also true that her mechanic-style shirt said \"Willie Product Support.\" However, the picture of Amanda Bynes did not show a her \"now\" working a new job \"9-5.\" The shirt simply seemed to be a style choice. It may also have been a joke based on the supposed company name. Also, the person's name on the shirt said \"Rich.\"\nA story from Us Weekly included the same picture with this caption: \"Amanda Bynes leaves a nail salon on October 10, 2019.\" Several other photographs from the same day were also published by In Touch Weekly.\nBynes was perhaps best known for her work in the 2003 film \"What a Girl Wants.\" She also appeared in \"Hairspray,\" \"Easy A,\" and \"Big Fat Liar.\" The former child star got her start on the wildly popular 1990s Nickelodeon television series \"All That,\" as well as \"The Amanda Show.\"",

        "content": "Polish and European officials joined thousands of people from across Poland on Saturday for the funeral of Pawe Adamowicz, the mayor of the northern city of Gdask, who died on Monday after being stabbed the night before at a charity event.\nThe European council president, Donald Tusk, a friend of Adamowicz, was among those attending the burial at the vast Gothic St Marys Basilica. Polands president, Andrzej Duda, and the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, also attended along with former leaders including Lech Wasa.\nOther dignitaries included the former German president Joachim Gauck and city mayors from other countries. The black urn with the mayors ashes will be laid to rest at one of the basilicas chapels.\nCrowds in the streets watched the ceremony on giant screens. A solemn procession brought Adamowiczs casket to the basilica for a mass on Friday night. The body was then cremated.\nEarlier, thousands of Poles, carrying flags and candles in cold streets, walked beside the coffin.\nThe killing of a liberal critic of the ruling partys anti-immigrant policies highlighted the charged atmosphere in parts of eastern Europe, where populist leaders have fanned nationalist sentiment.\nA car drove Adamowiczs corpse slowly through the Baltic coast city from the museum of the Solidarity movement that helped to bring down communism in Poland 30 years ago.\nFrom there, it passed schools, monuments and other places significant in 53-year-old Adamowiczs life, en route to the citys main church, St Marys Basilica, for burial on Saturday.\nThe streets, in some places covered with thin snow, were blocked, as crowds paid tribute to one of Polands longest-serving mayors who ran the city since 1998 and beat the candidate of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party in October.\nWe all feel great emptiness after the mayor has gone, mostly because he left in such a way, such a town, such a moment. I think that a certain stage of history, of humanity, is over, said mourner Ewa Wasinska-Stelter, 46, a teacher.\nAdamowicz was attacked on stage during one of Polands biggest annual charity events last Sunday and died the following day.\nPolish authorities have arrested a 27-year-old former convict, named only as Stefan W, over the killing. Speaking on stage, the attacker accused the mayors former party of putting him in prison, where he said he was tortured.\nHe was freed last month after serving 51/2 years for attempted bank robbery.\nAuthorities have also detained at least 10 people in recent days over calls on social media to murder and other acts of aggression in the wake of Adamowiczs death.\nCritics blame Polands politicians for cranking up hate speech in public life.\nAdamowicz was one of 11 Polish mayors targeted with fake death certificates by a far-right group called All-Polish Youth in 2017, after signing a declaration to welcome refugees in opposition to government policy.\nSupport for the conservative PiS fell to 30% in the wake of Adamowiczs death, according to a poll conducted by Kantar Millward Brown for Gazeta Wyborcza daily, from 33% in November. The biggest opposition grouping Koalicja Obywatelska has 25%.\nAs well as encouraging migrants to seek refuge in Gdask, Adamowicz was known for backing a campaign to defend rule of law against what activists consider efforts by the PiS to increase political control over the judiciary and other bodies.",

        "content": "The mayor of the northern Polish city of Gdask, Pawe Adamowicz, was stabbed on Sunday evening in an apparent assassination attempt in front of thousands of people during a charity concert.\nAdamowicz, who has served as mayor of Gdask since 1998, was resuscitated at the scene and rushed to a nearby hospital where he underwent five hours of surgery. Doctors described his condition as critical and serious.\nOne of the surgeons, Dr Tomasz Stefaniak, said Adamowicz suffered a serious wound to the heart, a wound to the diaphragm and to the internal organs and had needed a huge amount of blood. Gdansk is holding a blood collection for Adamowicz on Monday and a rally against violence is also planned.\nAdamowicz is a powerful liberal voice in a country that has been governed by the rightwing Law and Justice party since 2015. He is best known in Poland and internationally as a staunch supporter of LGBT rights and the rights of migrants and refugees during a period of rising anti-migrant sentiment. I am a European so my nature is to be open, Adamowicz told the Guardian in 2016. Gdask is a port and must always be a refuge from the sea.\nInterior minister Joachim Brudziski described the incident as an attack of inexplicable barbarity. Polish president Andrzej Duda said: Today I am unconditionally with him and his loved ones, just as I hope all of us compatriots are. I pray for his return to health and full strength.\nShocked to hear of the attack on Pawe Adamowicz, Mayor of Gdask, this evening, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, wrote on Twitter. Sending best wishes for his swift recovery, and solidarity to the city he leads, his family and supporters.\nPolish media reports quoting police sources have named the alleged assailant as Stefan W, a 27-year-old from Gdask with a record of violent crime. Polish law restricts the surnames of people accused of a crime being reported.\nVideo footage of the incident shows the assailant addressing the crowd from a microphone on the stage. He is reported as saying: Hello! Hello! My name is Stefan. I sat innocent in prison, I sat innocent in prison. Civic Platform tortured me, and thats why Adamowicz is dead.\nAdamowicz was a member of Polands pro-European Civic Platform, which governed Poland between 2007 and 2015, before leaving the party to fight local elections as an independent. It is understood that Stefan W was convicted of a series of violent assaults and sentenced to prison in 2014.\nAccording to police sources quoted by Polish news broadcaster TVN24, the assailant is understood to have been planning the attack for some time.\nThe fact that the assailant was able not only to gain access to the stage and to attack the mayor but also to address the crowd in the aftermath has raised serious questions about security, which was provided by a private firm.\nThe attack happened during the culmination of the annual Great Orchestra of Christmas festivities, a nationwide charity drive for equipment to treat children in state-run hospitals. The charity has raised more than 951 million zoty (200m) since it was founded 26 years ago. Concerts were being held for the charity across the country.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, involving doctors armed with weapons, gunshots to deter people from leaving a new coronavirus quarantine, and a woman who was shot dead after she attempted to break through a roadblock.\nWARNING: This article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person. As such, it may not be suitable for all viewers.\nIn February 2020, a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus.\nActor James Woods posted the video to his Twitter account, asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage:\nAlthough the video attached to Woods' tweet was later removed, at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other Twitter posts.\nWhile the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident, it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips, which we evaluate separately below.\nClip 1\nAre these armed doctors?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons. The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals.\nWhile we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word \"police\" can be briefly seen on the hood of this car.\nClip 2\nAre these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:\nNew video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. Therere multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.\nThere was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims.\nNobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed \"gunfire.\" This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year. One early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration.\nClip 3\nWas a woman shot dead after attempting to break through a coronavirus blockade?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe final clip in this video supposedly shows a woman who was \"shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade set up to contain #coronavirus.\"\nThis is a genuine video. However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident.\nRemnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike.\nLes Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a \"one-vehicle road accident\":\n\"In the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.\"\nIn Summary\nAlthough Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.\nWhen we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator's assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be \"atypical\" for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.",

Several scientific claims have been made or manufactured to further bolster the notion that something nefarious is going on with COVID-19 and these labs, but this information comes from non-peer-reviewed papers misconstrued to be actual additions to the scientific record, or from disreputable websites such as Mercola.com. The actual scientific facts known about the novel coronavirus leave little room for it to be a virus of human creation, however.\nRegardless, the idea of a Soros connection to the COVID-19 pandemic stems from the fact that Wuhan, China, was the apparent origin point of the novel coronavirus, and WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and medical device company, operates a \"small molecule drug discovery and research services\" facility there. And according to the conspiracy theory, Soros \"owns WuXi AppTec.\" QED.\nHowever, Soros holds no executive position at WuXi AppTec, and a list of the company's major shareholders shows that none owns more than 10% of the shares, and all of the largest shareholders are Chinese entities with no discernible connection to Soros himself.\nA May 2011 quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that Soros Fund Management, a private American investment management firm, does (or did) have a holding in a related company (Wuxi PharmaTech (Cayman)). However, such institutional investment is common in the business world and does not make the head of any given investment firm the \"owner\" of all the businesses in which the firm holds a stake.\nWhen pulled, the thread of Soros to Soros Fund Management, to Wuxi PharmaTech (Cayman), to WuXi AppTec, to a biotech research facility in Wuhan, leads to nothing. All credible scientific evidence indicates the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolved or mutated and was not bioengineered, and the addition of Soros to any far-fetched conspiracy theory indicates nothing so much as a lack of imagination.",

The Conway clip was gleaned from a 22 January 2017 Meet the Press interview with Chuck Todd. While Todd was taken aback by Conway's comment, his reaction to it was not to succumb to an uncontrollable fit of the giggles:\nCHUCK TODD: (...) answer the question of why the president asked the White House press secretary to come out in front of the podium for the first time and utter a falsehood? Why did he do that? It undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office ...\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: No it doesn't.\nCHUCK TODD: ... on day one.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck.

It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

Saleh continued tweeting his experiences with Delta on the morning of 21 December 2016 and asked other Twitter users for their assistance in reaching Delta and helping him return to his destination (New York):\nThe company sent a series of tweets to multiple users about Saleh's claims:\nIn their responses Delta asserted that \"more than 20 ... customers [expressed discomfort]\" but didn't explain why the passengers were uncomfortable, remarks that didn't go too far in discrediting the tweet's claim. (It's possible the incident was merely one of an unruly passenger's being removed from a crowded flight and was unrelated to anyone's \"speaking Arabic.\")\nSaleh's last tweet in the series indicated he managed to board a flight with a different carrier and expected to arrive in New York City later that day. At 12:15 on 21 December 2016, Delta issued a statement about the dispute:\nWe take all allegations of discrimination seriously and we are gathering all of the facts before jumping to any conclusion. Our culture requires treating everyone with respect. Furthermore, Delta people are trained to and frequently handle conflicts between passengers.\nMaintaining a safe, comfortable and orderly onboard environment is paramount for every flight and requires the cooperation of all of our customers in conjunction with adherence to directions from our crew members. This is a Delta policy and is required by U.S. regulations as well as others governing aviation worldwide.\nTwo customers were removed from Delta Flight 1 departing London-Heathrow today after a disturbance in the cabin resulted in more than 20 customers expressing their discomfort.\nWe have spoken with the customers who were removed; they were rebooked on another flight. Plans are in place to immediately speak with our crew and other passengers when the flight lands this afternoon. We will provide an update once we have more information.\nMediaite noted that Saleh has \"a history of making videos about fake anti-Muslim racial profiling incidents and prank videos about planes in particular,\" and former CNN host Soledad OBrien tweeted that a source had told her the crew was aware Saleh was a YouTube prankster:\nDelta later confirmed that aspect, posting a statement declaring that Saleh was removed from the flight he \"is a known prankster\" who \"sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior\":\nUpon landing the crew was debriefed and multiple passenger statements collected. Based on the information collected to date, it appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior, including shouting. This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight. While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.",

You don't just kick someone off for being loud!\" said Mr Saleh.\nMr Saleh's friend, Slim Albaher, who was also escorted off the plane, said: \"I just froze. It was like something you'd only see in the movies.\"\nMr Saleh is well-known for carrying out pranks, which he posts on YouTube.\nEarlier this month, he claimed to have hidden in a suitcase, external and travelled from Melbourne to Sydney in the hold. It was later exposed as a hoax.\nMr Saleh has also filmed a number of experiments to see how plane passengers respond to flying alongside Muslims.\nNumerous Arabic speakers have reported being questioned, or made to leave planes, and felt it was because of their race or assumptions about their religion.\nLondon pastor Olaolu Opebiyi was removed from an easyJet plane in March, after a passenger spotted a \"prayer on his phone\" and reported him as a security threat.\nAn Iraqi university student in California said he was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight in the US after having a conversation in Arabic in April.\nFaizah Shaheen, a Muslim from Leeds, was detained by UK airport police under terror laws in August, after she was spotted reading a book on Syrian culture during her honeymoon flight.",

One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

The displayed caption, however, does not capture a genuine exchange between a journalist and these vendors.\nThe text below the image originated with an article published on Medium in which the editors of the publication \"Level\" reimagined captions for various photographs that were taken on the day that a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, Jan. 6, 2021. The editors explained in the article's title and opening paragraph that these captions were not factual:\nWe Added Some Details to Getty Photos of Those Terrorists Who Stormed the U.S. Capitol\n[...]\nSee, most of the captions that come with those photos are minimally descriptive: Thousands of Donald Trump supporters storm the United States Capitol building following a Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, D.C. The world needs to know who these people are, so we went digging. Are these really their names and circumstances? Nope  but thats not going to stop us from thinking they are!\nWhile the viral caption for this picture is not real, the photograph is. It was taken near the U.S. Capitol the day of the insurrection and shows two unidentified vendors selling Trump merchandise. As lamented in the aforementioned article, the real caption on Getty Images does not provide much additional detail about these vendors:\nStreet vendors selling President Donald Trump memorabilia are seen on the sidewalk near the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC. A pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, breaking windows and clashing with police officers. Trump supporters gathered in the nation's capital today to protest the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over President Trump in the 2020 election.

        "content": "Claim:\nIn late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed whereby motorists were tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the road, as part of a prevalent sex-trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Yall See Anything Like This, Dont Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Dont Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"",

        "date": "2020-09-30T10:34:59",
        "content": "CLEVELAND (AP)  The first debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden deteriorated into bitter taunts and near chaos Tuesday night as Trump repeatedly interrupted his opponent with angry  and personal  jabs that sometimes overshadowed the sharply different visions each man has for a nation facing historic crises.\nIn the most tumultuous presidential debate in recent memory, Trump refused to condemn white supremacists who have supported him, telling one such group known as Proud Boys to stand back, stand by. There were also heated clashes over the presidents handling of the pandemic, the integrity of the election results, deeply personal attacks about Bidens family and how the Supreme Court will shape the future of the nations health care.\nBut it was the belligerent tone that was persistent, somehow fitting for what has been an extraordinarily ugly campaign. The two men frequently talked over each other with Trump interrupting, nearly shouting, so often that Biden eventually snapped at him, Will you shut up, man?\nThe fact is that everything hes saying so far is simply a lie, Biden said. Im not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows hes a liar.\nThe presidential race has been remarkably stable for weeks, despite the historic crises that have battered the country this year, including a pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans and a reckoning over race and police brutality. With just five weeks until Election Day and voting already underway in some key states, Biden has maintained a lead in national polls and in many battlegrounds.\nIts unclear whether the debate will do much to change those dynamics.\nOver and over, Trump tried to control the conversation, interrupting Biden and repeatedly talking over the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News. The president tried to deflect tough lines of questioning  whether on his taxes or the pandemic  to deliver broadsides against Biden.\nThe president drew a lecture from Wallace, who pleaded with both men to stop talking over each other. Biden tried to push back against Trump, sometimes looking right at the camera to directly address viewers rather than the president and snapping, Its hard to get a word in with this clown.\nAgain refusing to commit to honoring the results of the election, Trump spread falsehoods about mail voting. Without evidence, he suggested that the process  surging in popularity during the pandemic  was ripe for fraud and incorrectly claimed impropriety at a Pennsylvania voting site.\nBut despite his efforts to dominate the discussion, Trump was frequently put on the defensive and tried to sidestep when he was asked if he was willing to condemn white supremacists and paramilitary groups.\nWhat do you want to call them? Give me a name. Give me a name, Trump said, before Biden mentioned the far right, violent group known as the Proud Boys. Trump then pointedly did not condemn the group, instead saying: Proud Boys, stand back, stand by. But Ill tell you what, somebodys got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem.\nBiden attacked Trumps handling of the pandemic, saying that the president waited and waited to act when the virus reached Americas shores and still doesnt have a plan. Biden told Trump to get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap and go in his golf cart to the Oval Office to come up with a bipartisan plan to save people.\nTrump snarled a response, declaring: Ill tell you Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You dont have it in your blood.\nI know how to do the job, was the solemn response from Biden, who served eight years as Barack Obamas vice president.\nThe pandemics effects were in plain sight, with the candidates lecterns spaced far apart, all the guests in the small crowd tested and the traditional opening handshake scrapped. While neither candidate wore a mask to take the stage, their families did sport face coverings.\nTrump struggled to define his ideas for replacing the Affordable Care Act on health care in the debates early moments and defended his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, declaring, I was not elected for three years, Im elected for four years.\nWe won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate. We have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all.\nTrump criticized Biden over the former vice presidents refusal to comment on whether he would try to expand the Supreme Court in retaliation if Barrett is confirmed to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. That idea has gained momentum on the partys left flank, but Biden tried to put distance between himself and the liberal wing, declining to endorse the Green New Deal and rejecting the assertion that he was under the control of radicals by declaring I am the Democratic Party now.\nThe scattershot debate bounced from topic to topic, with Trump again refusing to embrace the science of climate change while Biden accused Trump of walking away from the American promise of equity for all and making a race-based appeal.\nThis is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division, Biden said.\nRecent months have seen major protests after the deaths of Black people at the hands of police. Biden said the country faces a problem with systemic racism and that while the vast majority of police officers are decent, honorable men and women there are bad apples and people have to be held accountable.\nTrump in turn claimed that Bidens work on a federal crime bill treated the African American population about as bad as anybody in this country. The president pivoted to his hardline focus on those protesting racial injustice and accused Biden of being afraid to use the words law and order, out of fear of alienating the left.\nViolence in response is never appropriate, Biden said. Never appropriate. Peaceful protest is.\nThe attacks turned deeply personal when Trump returned to a campaign attack line by declaring that Bidens son, Hunter, had inappropriately benefitted from his fathers connections while working in Ukraine. Biden rarely looked at Trump during the night but turned to face the president when he defended his sons, including Beau, an Army veteran who died of cancer in 2015, after the commander in chiefs reported insults of those who served in the military.\nA new report from two Republican-led Senate committees alleged that Hunter Bidens work in Ukraine at the same time his father was vice president raised conflict-of-interest concerns for the Obama administration, but the report did not link Joe Biden to any wrongdoing or misconduct. Trump was impeached for pushing Kiev to investigate the Biden family.\nThe debate was arguably Trumps best chance to try to reframe the campaign as a choice between candidates and not a referendum over his handling of the virus that has killed more people in America than any other nation. Americans, according to polling, have soured on his leadership in the crisis, and the president has struggled to land consistent attacks on Biden.\nIn the hours before the debate, Biden released his 2019 tax returns just days after the blockbuster revelations about Trumps long-hidden tax history, including that he paid only $750 a year in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017 and nothing in many other years. The Bidens paid nearly $300,000 in taxes in 2019.\nTrump, in the debate, insisted he paid millions in taxes  but refused to say how much he paid in federal income taxes  and insisted he had taken advantage of legal tax incentives, another angry exchange that led to Biden declaring that Trump was the worst president the nation has ever had.\n___\nLemire reported from New York.

        "content": "Updated Oct. 2, 2020\nPresident Donald Trumps constant interruptions of both Democratic nominee Joe Biden and moderator Chris Wallace threw the first presidential debate of 2020 into a state of confusion. Biden began interrupting as well as the two candidates clashed over the coronavirus crisis, racial justice protests, the economy and Trumps taxes.\nTrump used some of the falsehoods from his COVID-19 talking points, and Biden floated some inaccuracies about Trumps handling of the pandemic.\nMany of the candidates claims needed a fact-check.\nTrump: \"We guaranteed preexisting conditions.\"\nMisleading\nPresident Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 that says those with preexisting conditions will be able to get affordable health care coverage. The executive order language was a response to criticisms about Trumps efforts against the Affordable Care Act. However, legal and health policy experts said that the executive order guarantees nothing near the protections in the ACA. The experts said actual congressional legislation, not this type of order, is necessary to maintain these preexisting conditions protections if the ACA goes away.\nAt PolitiFact, we are committed to fact-checking newsworthy, questionable and interesting claims, regardless of who said them. Read more about our process of how we select claims to check.\nBiden: \"The president has no plan\" for the coronavirus pandemic.\nNeeds context\nThe Trump administration has announced a plan on how it will distribute vaccines. The plan shows that the federal government aims to make the two-dose vaccine free of cost, for instance.\nHowever, public health experts have said that Trump and his administration did not have a plan to combat the pandemic or a national testing plan.\nTrump: \"If you had good forest management you wouldnt be getting  calls (that Californias on fire).\"\nRating: False\nForest maintenance does play a role in mitigating forest fires, but that doesn't negate the fact that climate change has made Californias environment much more flammable. Climatologists, ecologists and wildfire experts all told us that climate change has not only fueled the fires but also worsened their impact.\nThe area affected by wildfires in California has expanded tenfold over the last four decades. Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University, told us that \"about half\" of that increase is attributable to the effects of global warming.\nTrump: Says Biden \"wants to shut down the country.\"\nNeeds context\nIn an interview with CBS News, Biden was asked if he was prepared to shut down the country down to deal with the coronavirus.\n\"I would be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus,\" Biden said. \"In order to keep the country running and moving and the economy growing, and people employed, you have to fix the virus, you have to deal with the virus.\"\nAnd then he said, \"I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists.\"\nRELATED: Trump campaign's bingo card of \"Biden's lies\" is full of falsehoods\nTrump: \"Why did (Hunter Biden) deserve three and a half million from Moscow?\"\nLimited and disputed evidence\nTrump hit an unverified story about Bidens son Hunter over and over again. \"Why is it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscows wife gave your son three and half million dollars,\" Trump said.\nA Senate Republican report said the widow of the ex-mayor sent $3.5 million to an American account in 2014.\nRepublicans tied Hunter Biden to the account, but refused to share any documents that might substantiate that. Hunter Bidens lawyer said he had no connection to the account. Democratic Senate staff said theyve seen the documents that Republicans have, and that they dont tie Hunter Biden to the account.\nTrump: \"Im getting (insulin) so cheap, its like water.\"\nRating: Mostly False\nTrump signed an executive order on insulin at the end of July, but the scope was limited. It targeted a select group of health care providers that represent fewer than 2% of the relevant outlets for insulin. Between 2017 and 2018, insulin prices for seniors rose.\n\"The truth is that patients who need drugs like insulin are having a hard time affording them, particularly for the many who are now uninsured,\" said Vanderbilt Medical Centers Stacie Dusetzina.\nTrump: \"I don't think you have any law enforcement (endorsements).\"\nExaggerates\nMany police unions have endorsed Trump, the largest being the Fraternal Order of Police representing about 355,000 officers. But he goes too far in saying Biden has no support.\nThe Biden campaign shared a list of over 190 current or former law enforcement officials who back him. It is mainly a mix of sheriffs and prosecutors at a variety of levels, from county to U.S. attorneys.\nOur work gives people the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy. You can explore our database of over 18,000 fact-checks, as well as our promise tracking for elected officials.\nTrump: \"I have Florida, I have Texas, I have Ohio, I have, excuse me, Portland. The sheriff just came out today and he said I support President Trump.\"\nWrong\nPortland is in Multnomah County, and Sheriff Mike Reese tweeted he doesnt back Trump.\n\"As the Multnomah County Sheriff I have never supported Donald Trump and will never support him,\" Reese said.\nTrump: I paid \"millions of dollars\" in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017.\nDisputed\nThis is countered by reporting from the New York Times, which obtained years of tax-return data for Trump and his businesses. The Times reported that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, and no taxes at all in 10 of the 15 years before that.\nTrump has refused to release his tax returns, pending an audit, and he likely pays other types of taxes. But on federal income taxes, he has not provided evidence to refute the Times report. Theres \"no evidence of millions in income taxes,\" said Edward McCaffery, a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California.\nTrump: Says Joe Biden \"said you went to Delaware State but you forgot the name of your college.\"\nRating: False\nTrumps claim was putting words in Bidens mouth. The former vice president never said that he attended Delaware State.\nTrump appeared to be referring to a remark that Biden made at a town hall in Florence, S.C., where he said that he got his \"start\" at DSU. In context, its clear that Biden wasnt implying that he went to the university, but referencing the support he received from the school in 1972 when he announced his run for U.S. Senate on the campus.\nBiden: Says Trump suggested that \"maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of (the coronavirus).\"\nNeeds context\nTrump did not explicitly suggest that people inject bleach in their arms. He did express interest in exploring whether disinfectants could be applied to the site of a coronavirus infection. The comment came after an administration official presented a study that found sun exposure and cleaning agents like bleach could kill the virus when it lingers on surfaces.\nOn disinfectant, Trump said: \"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so itd be interesting to check that, so that youre going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.\"\nTrump: \"Today there was a big problem in Philadelphia. They went into watch. They were called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch.\"\nFalse\nPennsylvania allows campaigns and parties to appoint two poll watchers per precinct to observe voting at polling places on Election Day, and if necessary file legal challenges. But starting this week, Philadelphia opened the first satellite office for a new form of early voting. These offices dont allow poll watchers, according to the city.\nA woman showed up at a satellite office at an elementary school on Sept. 29 and said she was there to monitor the election but provided no proof she was a poll watcher. The woman told the Philadelphia Inquirer, a PolitiFact partner, that she was hired by the Trump campaign but would not provide her name.\nTrump: \"Take a look at West Virginia, mailmen selling the ballots.\"\nInaccurate\nA mail carrier in West Virginia pled guilty to charges related to attempted election fraud, but not for selling ballots. We found no evidence of mailmen selling ballots, and the Trump campaign did not provide backup for Trumps claim.\nThe clerk of Pendleton County in April received primary election absentee ballot request forms from eight voters on which the voter's party-ballot request appeared to have been altered, said the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia.\nAn investigation found that five ballot requests had been altered from \"Democrat\" to \"Republican.\" In three other requests, the party wasnt changed, but the request was altered, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office.\nThomas Cooper, 47, who held a contract with the U.S. Postal Service to deliver mail in Pendleton County, admitted to altering some of the requests. He said it was a joke. Cooper pled guilty in July to one count of attempting to defraud West Virginia residents of \"a fair election\" and one count of \"injury to the mail.\"\nTrump: \"Im the one that brought back football. By the way, Im the one that brought back Big Ten football.\"\nMisleading\nTrump did push the Big Ten college football conference to reverse its decision to not play football this fall over COVID-19 concerns, and spoke with Kevin Warren, the conferences commissioner.\nBut National Collegiate Athletic Association president, Mark Emmert, said he hadnt talked with the White House since April, and Big Ten officials who voted to resume play in October said Trumps position wasnt significant in their reversal.\nAn unidentified Big Ten member president insisted that Trump's calls for fall football played no role in the conferences decisions.\nTrump: \"I dont think (Kellyanne Conway) said that\" riots, chaos and violence helps Trumps cause.\nShe did.\nIn an Aug. 27 interview with \"Fox & Friends,\" former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg blaming Trump for unrest in cities. \"I guess Mayor Pete knows full stop that the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on whos best on public safety and law and order,\" Conway said.\nTrump: Says his rallies were \"outdoors.\"\nMisleading\nTrump has held many outdoor rallies, but he did hold indoor rallies in Nevada and Oklahoma in recent months. Trump held a rally June 20 at the BOK Center in Tulsa, Okla. Arena officials, who scanned tickets, said the crowd totaled around 6,200.\nOn Sept. 13, about 5,600 supporters gathered to hear Trump speak at Xtreme Manufacturing, a warehouse, in Henderson, Nev., despite a state rule prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people. Many people in the crowd were not wearing masks. The company was fined by the city for multiple violations.\nTrump: Says Biden called African Americans \"superpredators\" when he did the 1994 crime bill.\nNo evidence\nIn a Nov. 18, 1993, Senate floor speech, Biden spoke about doing something for young people who did not have supervision or structure and who did not have opportunities. He said the country needed to focus on them, because otherwise, a portion of them would \"become the predators 15 years from now.\" Biden did not single out African Americans.\n\"Madam President, we have predators on our streets, and society has in fact, because of its neglect, created that,\" Biden said, according to the Congressional Record.\nThe term \"superpredators\" also came up during the 2016 presidential campaign between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. We found that Clinton in 1996 used the term \"superpredator\" when referring to \"gangs of kids.\" Clinton did not specifically label superpredators as African American, but the context of her speech and her subsequent apology decades later suggests it was a reasonable inference.\nTrump: Biden called members of the military \"stupid bastards. He said it on tape. He said stupid bastards.\"\nRating: Half True\nBiden used the term \"stupid bastards\" as part of a joke in addressing a group of airmen during a trip overseas in 2016.\nBidens presidential campaign confirmed that he called the service members in the audience \"stupid bastards\" and a \"dull bunch,\" but said his remarks were made not in disrespect, but in jest to generate applause for a female lieutenant he was referencing. In his full speech, Biden repeatedly complimented the troops and spoke about his late son Beau, who served as a major in the Delaware Army National Guard.\nBiden: Trump is \"the only one defunding\" police. His budget \"calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance.\"\nRating: Mostly True\nTrumps budget plan for FY 2021 sought to reduce spending on state and local law enforcement aid in two ways. He would cut $280 million from a broad range of assistance programs, and another $170 million from a community policing initiative, Community Oriented Policing Services, that dates back to the days of President Bill Clinton.\nThe total is over $400 million. The caveat is most  but not all  of the affected programs provide direct aid to local police. There is some money aimed at teens who are at risk or have already broken the law, with the goal of keeping them out of prison.\nBiden: \"We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before.\"\nRating: Mostly False\nThe most inclusive measurement of trade, which includes goods and services, shows that the U.S. trade deficit with China was smaller under Trump in 2019, the most recent full year, than it was in any of the final three years of the Obama administration.\nBut looking only at goods shows the trade deficit was generally higher under Trump than it was in the Obama years. Still, in 2019, it declined to around the same level as the final year of the Obama administration.\nBiden: Violent crime went down \"15% in our administration. Its gone up on his watch.\"\nPartially accurate\nBiden is right about the Obama-Biden record, but wrong about Trumps record. The violent crime rate fell nearly 16% from 2008, when Barack Obama and Biden were elected, to 2016, the last full year of their administration. But the violent crime rate has decreased every year Trump has been in office, according to FBI data.\nBiden earlier this month claimed that when he was vice president, violent crime fell 15% and that the murder rate was up 26% across the nation this year under Trump. We rated that Half True; that comparison was based on snapshots of different crime data and at different time intervals during each administration.\nTrump: Obama and Biden \"passed a tax bill that gave us all of these privileges for depreciation, tax credits. We build a building, and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Ave.\"\nNeeds context\nThe Trump campaign referred PolitiFact to a passage in the New York Times recent investigation into Trumps taxes (a report that Trump has called \"fake news\"). The passage referred to a change in tax law signed by President Barack Obama during the Great Recession that allowed losses from businesses to be used to reduce tax liability for four previous years, rather than the previous limit of two years.\nBut the relevance of this provision to his hotel property on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., is less clear. During the Obama years, Trump struck a deal with the federal government to turn the Old Post Office building into a hotel. A 2015 report by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., found that the Trump Organization directly received $40 million under the Federal Historic Tax Credit. This tax credit was not enacted under Obama and Biden; it has been on the books since 1976.\nBiden: \"One in 1,000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus.\"\nNeeds context\nIts tough to say precisely how many African Americans have died of COVID-19 because the government does not have complete information about the race and ethnicity of those who have died. But based on limited available data, Biden seems to be in the ballpark. Earlier this month, the research arm of American Public Media found that 1 in 1,020 Black Americans has died of the virus  the highest mortality rate of any racial group nationwide  based on death rate data collected from every state and the District of Columbia.\nTrump: \"Dr. Fauci said the opposite, he said very strongly,\" challenging Bidens statement that no \"serious person\" would say masks werent important in reducing COVID-19 spread.\nMisleading\nIn a March 7 CBS News interview, Dr. Anthony Fauci said, \"Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.\" At the time, still early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not recommending that Americans wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Masks were instead being reserved for health care workers, because there were concerns about having shortages of personal protective equipment.\nAs it became clear that high percentages of people were asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the CDC updated their guidelines on April 3 to recommend mask wearing. Fauci later acknowledged the resulting confusion but said public health leaders were making decisions based on the information they had at the time. He has since maintained that masks are important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.\nTrump: Joe Biden \"had 308,000 military people dying because you couldnt provide them proper healthcare in the military.\"\nRating: False\nTrumps number comes out of a Department of Veterans Affairs eligibility system database that VA investigators called \"virtually unreliable.\" In 2014, the VAs database contained applications for people who died before 1998. In the course of moving millions of records around in 2013, the VA inadvertently created enrollment entries for people \"who never sought care or applied for enrollment.\"\nInvestigators found over 307,000 applications listed as pending, but that included people who might never have applied or been eligible for care. In any event, 84% of the total died prior to 2010, the Obama-Biden administrations second year.\nTrump: Hunter Biden was \"dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\nDischarged, not dishonorably\nHunter Biden received an administrative discharge  not a dishonorable one  from the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2013 after testing positive for cocaine. The Navy doesnt release the discharge status of low ranking officers, but Biden disclosed that he had been administratively discharged in a 2014 statement to the Wall Street Journal.\nDishonorable discharges are reserved for service members who have engaged in what the military considers the most reprehensible conduct, like sexual assault and murder. Administrative discharges are handed down for transgressions the military deems less serious.\nTrump: In manufacturing, \"I brought back 700,000 jobs. (Obama and Biden) brought back nothing.\"\nRating: False.\nTrump was wrong about the job gains on his watch; the actual increase was about 450,000 prior to the pandemic.\nAs for Obama and Biden, they saw gains of 916,000 if you start counting with the recovery from the Great Recession, which is the fairest comparison as long as you also ignore the losses under Trump during the pandemic.\nRELATED STORY: Donald Trumps stand back and stand by debate comments on white supremacists\nBiden: \"Suburbs are by and large integrated.\"\nRating: Half True\nBiden's statement goes further than the evidence indicates. Studies show that suburbs today are, on the broadest level, significantly more integrated than they were in previous decades, thanks to both legal changes and shifts in public attitudes. At the same time, more than two-thirds of Americans, and three-quarters of whites, do not live in substantially integrated neighborhoods.\nBiden: \"There's 100 million people that have preexisting conditions.\"\nRating: Mostly True.\nEstimates vary widely regarding how many Americans have preexisting conditions. Although Bidens number was at the mid-point of the estimates, based on our reporting, from 54 million to 133 million, there does not seem to be a definitive answer. Much depends on definitions. But there is agreement that if the Affordable Care Act were overturned by the Supreme Court, millions of Americans with medical conditions could face difficulty in accessing health insurance.\nThis report was written by PolitiFact staff writers Jon Greenberg, Louis Jacobson, Amy Sherman, Samantha Putterman, Miriam Valverde, Bill McCarthy, Noah Y. Kim and Daniel Funke and Kaiser Health News reporters Victoria Knight and Emmarie Huetteman.\nIts never been more important to know the facts...\n2020 is not what any of us expected. We thought wed be fact-checking a spirited political debate about the economy, health care and more ahead of voting in November.\nWell, were still doing that, but in the midst of the worst public health crisis in a century.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has been a call to action for all fact-checking newsrooms like ours to root out harmful hoaxes because, and we can say this with certainty, every single person in the U.S. is affected by the spread of COVID-19 and misinformation around it.\nAnd, while its never been more essential to read our fact-checking, PolitiFact is not immune from the economic uncertainty that the pandemic brings.

        "content": "Claim:\nChinese officials are seeking approval to start the mass killing of 20,000 people in order to stop the spread of new coronavirus.\nOn Feb. 5, 2020, the website AB-TC (aka City News) published an article that claimed Chinese officials were seeking approval from the Supreme Peoples Court to start the mass killing of 20,000 people infected with the new coronavirus in an attempt to contain the disease:\nChina seek for courts approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus\nThe highest level of court in Chhina [sic], Supreme Peoples Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.\nThe State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.\nThis is not a genuine news report. While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet's reporting.\nFor starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \"BREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\" But Shurmur didn't die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.\nThe website has also published hoax articles about \"cannibal restaurants\" (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\nThis website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:\nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News' website\nOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called City News published an article titled BREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\nAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\nNone of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person's byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called \"local correspondents.\"\nIn other words, this website doesn't exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting.\nIn addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC's article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \"document\" or a \"press conference,\" they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \"the state\" or \"the court\" or an \"official\" made a statement, but doesn't provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\nLastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China \"ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.\" That report, of course, made no mention of \"mass killings.\"\nThere is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China website.\nAB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we've concluded that this report is indeed false.",

In fact, it depicted an area completely on the opposite side of the U.S. from Seattle.\nAs noted on the Greenpointers neighborhood blog, this picture was taken in Greenpoint, a neighborhood in northern Brooklyn, New York, and it recorded the aftermath of a trash fire:\n[M]any social media posts have repackaged the likely aftermath of a trash fire on the corner of West and Huron Streets in Greenpoint as a scene from Seattles protests.\nManny Lorras, a tenant in the building complex near the corner of West and Huron Streets, confirmed that the image is 1000% of the building on that corner. He also thinks it has to be the trash fire that occurred on that street on June 2 of this year.\nWhen the fire department came ... the hose pressure blew out the window, he explained, having received much of his information about the fire from one of the doorman in his building complex.\nBuilding management boarded up the broken window that day, Lorras says. Whoever took the photograph must have snapped it soon after the fire department came, according to Lorrass version of events. (A window in the image is shattered.)\nA short video of the scene viewable on Instagram notes that the appearance of the area \"was caused by a lit cigarette tossed from an apartment, erupting the pile of trash bags in flames,\" and was \"not related to demonstrations\":",

        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a real trampoline bridge in Paris.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nPhotographs purportedly showing a \"trampoline bridge\" in Paris have been circulating on the internet since at least 2012. While these photographs are frequently shared along with the claim that they show a real structure, these are concept images that were originally created for an architecture competition:\nThe program challenges participants to design a New Contemporary Bridge over the Seine River in Paris. The new Bridge should create a new Icon or landmark in Paris, considering that there are approximately 37 Bridges over the Seine. The design should take into account the position of the location and the expectation for Iconic bridge in a city like Paris.\nThe design firm Atelier Zndel Cristea (AZC) was awarded third place for their bouncing bridge design. While this bridge was never constructed over the Seine River, AZC described the concept on their web site:\nSaut de Seine is an inflatable bridge equipped with giant trampolines, dedicated to the joyful release from gravity as one bounces above the river. Installed near the Bir-Hakeim Bridge, the Saut de Seine Bridge is formed of inflatable modules, like giant life-preservers, 30 meters in diameter. In the central part of each ring, a trampoline mesh is stretched. The floating buoys, fabricated in PVC membrane, are attached together by cord to form a stable and self-supporting ensemble. Each module under tension, about 30m diameter - filled with 3700 cubic meters of air - develops in space with an arch-like form. Le total length of the bridge is about 94m. The Saut de Seine allows every visitor a novel view of Paris from his or her own unique spatial position: upright and leaping, upside down and tumbling, gliding above like a circus performer The installation is located in direct relationship to Eiffels tower, itself a symbol of ephemeral architecture designed to provide a unique experience: a view of all of Paris. We think the superposition of these two works reveals a specific kind of architecture: one designed to install an experience of happiness in the city.\nIt's not completely unprecedented, though. AZC did build a smaller model of the bouncing bridge in 2014. The prototype was about a third of the conceptualized size (about 10m in diameter) and was temporarily installed on the Lake of Banyoles:\nThis project was developed for a competition which topic was to design a contemporary bridge in Paris. As the opportunity presented itself, we chose to design a bridge of a new kind. A bridge that would allow amazing uses and surprising sensations. Why not conceive a temporary bridge? A bridge that could take part of a summer event such as \"Paris Plage\". It would allow sensational amusement and release our deepest emotions. We imagined the Bouncing Bridge!\n[...]\nWe designed a model of 10 m diameter, about a third of the original dimension, in order to test its performances. The main material of the module is a membrane made of reinforced PVC. To reproduce the complex shape of the curve, the Bridge was modeled digitally, and decomposed in different fragments. This method allowed to cut all the elements by a computerized machine. Then all the elements were assembled by thermal weld.\nThe idea of a permanent bouncing bridge is intriguing, but would probably be impractical (especially during winter months).",

        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

        "date": "2020-06-03T06:23:37",
        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Donald Trump (or his administration) has the legal authority to designate antifa as a terrorist organization.\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on May 31, 2020, that the United States would be designating \"ANTIFA\" as a \"Terrorist Organization.\"\nTrump's tweet appeared in response to growing protests after the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck on May 25:\nTrump and several top officials, including U.S. Attorney General William Barr, have been blaming, without evidence, antifa and other groups they call \"agitators\" for the protests that have taken over cities across the United States. Barr also said in a statement that \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\nBut the United States currently does not have a process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations, which makes Trump's ability to enforce such a designation highly unlikely.\nAntifa, short for anti-fascist, is an amorphous movement of people who are opposed to fascism. They do not comprise an organized group, do not have a visible leadership, and acknowledge that they are secretive, so it is impossible to know how many people even count themselves as members. Anti-fascists lean strongly toward the left of the political spectrum, and many of them refer to themselves as socialists, anarchists, communists, or anti-capitalists. The positions of various antifa groups can also be difficult to define, but many of them support oppressed community members and protest against amassing of wealth by corporations.\nSome antifa movements date their origins to the battle against European fascism in the 1920s and '30s. The BBC cited Mark Bray, the author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" as an authority in noting that \"[Bray] says the modern American Antifa movement began in the 1980s with a group called Anti-Racist Action. Its members confronted neo-Nazi skinheads at punk gigs in the American Midwest and elsewhere. By the early 2000s the Antifa movement was mostly dormant -- until the rise of Donald Trump and the alt-right.\"\nAntifa groups are not monolithic and employ a range of tactics. Many condemn the use of violence, but according to BBC News, some groups engage in aggressive confrontations, especially with far-right groups on the streets. Extreme factions have carried pepper spray, bricks, knives, and chains with them.\nTrump claimed members of the movement were responsible for acts of vandalism during the May and June 2020 protests against police brutality in the U.S., but in at least one case a white supremacist group was found to have posed as antifa on Twitter. Groups associated with both right and left, not just antifa, are being accused of inciting violence and looting during the protests. In most cases it is difficult to ascertain that antifa is solely responsible for the lawless activities occurring at some protests, and the culprits are still being investigated, as Keith Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, observed on NBC's \"Meet the Press\":\n\"The truth is, nobody really knows ...Theres been a lot of videotape taken by demonstrators of people who are very suspicious, who really did start breaking windows ... There have been other photographs of cars with no license plates. Very suspicious behavior.\nIt would all have to be investigated, he said.\nWithout any official structure to the group, or much evidence linking antifa to specific acts of violence, it would be difficult to prove that that body of activists is behind anything, Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security program, said: \"As far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure ... Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\"\nTrump's ability to designate anti-fascists as a terrorist group is also highly suspect given that only foreign groups can be labeled as \"terrorist\" organizations under U.S. law, and \"domestic terrorism\" is not currently a federal crime in the U.S., according to the New York Times:\nA federal law defines terrorism as crimes of violence that are intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government policy. But it distinguishes between international terrorism, which must have a foreign or transnational nexus, and domestic terrorism, which occurs primarily on American soil.\nActs of terrorism transcending national boundaries is a federal crime, giving the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors jurisdiction to take the lead. There is no equivalent crime of domestic terrorism, so law enforcement officials deal with such offenses using other laws that do not have terrorism in their labels, such as the state-level crime of murder.\nA 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) on domestic terrorism similarly stated that:\nThe federal government does not generate an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations or individuals. The development of such a list may be precluded by civil liberties concerns (i.e., inclusion in a publicly available list may impinge on a groups exercise of free speech or its other constitutionally protected activities). However, a lack of official lists or processes to designate groups or individuals as domestic terrorists makes it difficult to assess domestic terrorism trends and evaluate federal efforts to counter such threats. In 2011, an unnamed [Department of Homeland Security] official cited in a news report stated that unlike international terrorism, there are no designated domestic terrorist groups. Subsequently, all the legal actions of an identified extremist group leading up to an act of violence are constitutionally protected and not reported on by DHS.\nThe CRS report also noted that although the U.S. does not officially designate domestic terror organizations, it does record individual terrorists and threats in its Terrorist Screening Database:\nWhile the government does not provide an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does include domestic terrorists (along with international terrorists) in its Terrorist Screening Database, commonly known as the Terrorist Watchlist ...\nWhile not naming specific groups, DOJ and the FBI have openly delineated domestic terrorist threats. DOJ has identified domestic terrorism threats to include criminal activity by animal rights extremists, ecoterrorists, anarchists, antigovernment extremists such as sovereign citizens and unauthorized militias, black separatists, white supremacists, and abortion extremists.\nIn an interview with Snopes, Patel said that a number of different crimes can be designated as acts of terrorism:\nThere is no single crime of either domestic or international terrorism. But both types of terrorism can be prosecuted under a number of statutes which constitute crimes of terrorism. The crime of hijacking an airplane, for example, is an act of terrorism. In fact, the government has available 51 different criminal statutes which can be applied domestic terrorism. It does not  and should not  have the ability to designate a domestic organization. This would allow the government to target political activity as terrorism, which is exactly what the White House and the Justice Department are trying to do by threatening to go after protestors under the guise of targeting Antifa.\nThe State Department makes a list of designated \"Foreign Terrorist Organizations\" (FTO) available on their website. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), enforcing the terrorist designation for FTOs involves blocking assets, prosecuting individuals, and imposing immigration restrictions on FTOs, their members, and their supporters.\nPatel added that the Secretary of State can designate foreign terrorist groups, but this triggers a range of consequences: \"most important of which is the ability to prosecute anyone who provides the group with material support, no matter how minimal. In addition property and assets of persons linked to terrorism can be blocked, but only under a law that requires a connection to a mainly foreign threat.\"\nThus, as a large, decentralized entity with no infrastructure or assets that we know of, designating and targeting antifa as a domestic terrorist organization could, according to some experts, create a dangerous scenario, as Patel told us:\nIf persons who identified as 'Antifa' suspected of committing crimes that violate any of the federal crimes of terrorism or other criminal they could of course be properly investigated and prosecuted. The FBI has more than ample authority to investigate individuals they suspect of being engaged in criminal activity. The problem is the FBI's rules are so loose they can also investigate people who are not suspected of criminal activity, so these powers are easily abused. The FBI has a long history of investigating environmentalists and anti-war activists and recently fabricated a new terrorist threat of black identity extremists and it would be altogether surprising if they didnt spy on the protestors.\nThe paucity of evidence directly connecting antifa to acts violence during protests, combined with the structureless nature of the group and the fact that the U.S. currently has no legal process for designating domestic terrorist organizations, leads us to rate this claim as \"False.\"",

        "content": "As some nationwide protests have turned violent, President Donald Trump pointed to the anti-fascist movement antifa, claiming: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. But there is no such official federal designation for domestic terrorism organizations.\nExperts cited other reasons a designation  even if it were made possible  would be difficult or questionable. Antifa isnt one organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left militant anti-fascism groups.\nJames J.F. Forest, professor in the University of Massachusetts Lowells School of Criminology and Justice Studies, told us in an email. So, imagine the difficulty a prosecutor would face in a court of law proving beyond a reasonable doubt an individual was a member of ANTIFA.\nAs far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure, Faiza Patel, director of the liberty & national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told us in an interview. Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\nProtests against police brutality and racial injustice have erupted in cities across the country following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, after a Minneapolis police officer, who is white, kneeled on his neck for several minutes, as shown in a video of the arrest.\nSome of those protests have turned violent, with businesses looted and fires set. Trump, and others in the administration, have blamed antifa and the Radical Left, as Trump put it, though state and federal officials have pointed to various groups or outsiders generally. The violence and vandalism is being led by antifa and other radical left-wing groups, the president said on May 30.\nThe next day, Trump made his statement about designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\nNo Domestic Terrorist Designation\nTheres no legal process or meaning for what the president said, Patel told us. Hes reflecting on the process that we use for foreign terrorist organizations.\nThe secretary of state has the legal authority to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations under federal law. The federal government makes those FTO designations through a six-step process involving the State Department and other agencies. The designations enable the federal government to freeze assets, prosecute individuals for aiding those groups and restrict immigration for members of those groups, as the Government Accountability Office explains.\n[W]e have federal criminal statutes regarding Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, but no equivalent for domestic terrorism, Forest told us. As an example, Timothy McVeigh was prosecuted in federal court for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing under a federal law addressing weapons of mass destruction because the ideology that motivated his attack was not connected to any foreign entity.\nIf there were a domestic terrorist designation, Patel said, it would undoubtedly face a First Amendment challenge, which is likely to succeed.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service also explained in a 2017 report that the federal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations. In other words, there is no official open-source roster of domestic groups that the FBI or other federal agencies target as terrorist organizations.\nIt, too, cited concerns about infringing on First Amendment freedoms if a domestic terrorist designation were possible. Such a list might discourage speech and expression related to the ideologies underpinning the activities of named groups, the CRS report said.\nMary McCord, legal director at Georgetown University Law Centers Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former Department of Justice official, and Hina Shamsi, the American Civil Liberties Unions national security project director, made similar statements to the press. No current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns, McCord said.\nWe asked the White House about the presidents tweet but we havent received a response.\nOn the same day as Trumps statement, Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement: The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\nBarrs language isnt an official designation but could indicate the resources the Department of Justice and FBI are going to put into investigating a particular threat, Patel said. She noted that the FBI has long history of targeting protest groups and said she would be very worried that by targeting antifa, an amorphous term, the Justice Department would actually be infiltrating and targeting legitimate protest activity.\nThe CRS report said that while theres no domestic terrorist designation, the DOJ and FBI have publicly named and discussed domestic terrorism threatssuch as animal rights extremism or anarchist extremismwithout illuminating exactly how they arrive at these categories.\nForest said the court cases against those individuals relied on laws against sabotage, vandalism, harassment, et al  but not domestic terrorism. The language about such threats can also indicate what resources and priority groups would receive from the DOJ. Technically, the FBI cant really gain any law enforcement tools it didnt already have simply by calling something a terrorist threat, Forest said.\nPatel said the FBI calling a group a threat was mostly language but could also reflect what resources theyre going to devote to an issue. When we call something terrorism, she said, were suggesting its something very serious.\nAlso, Forest said there are sentencing enhancements for terrorism-related acts that could bring added prison time to a conviction.\nSome experts have argued Congress should enact a law to make domestic terrorism a federal offense.\nMcCord and Jason M. Blazakis, director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, wrote in the Lawfare blog on Feb. 27, 2019 that designation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies. But making it a crime to materially support domestic terrorism  just as its a federal crime to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization  does not raise the same concerns.\nPatel, however, has argued the opposite. After House lawmakers, spurred into action by deadly white nationalists attacks, introduced legislation to make domestic terrorism a federal crime, she wrote, in October 2019, that such a law was both unnecessary and creates serious risks of abuse.\nThe FBI already has all the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of white nationalist violence, Patel said.\nUnclear What Groups Have Incited Violence\nTrump, Barr and National Security Adviser Robert OBrien have pointed to antifa as driving or leading the violent acts that have erupted in some protests. We asked the White House if it could point to evidence of that, but we havent received a response. Various government officials have blamed different groups, or said they didnt know who was behind it.\nIn a May 30 tweet, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the city was now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.\nMark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, wrote in the Washington Post that he suspects some members of antifa groups have been involved in the protests but there arent enough of them to lead nationwide destruction tactics.\n[A]ntifa itself is not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity, Bray said.\nBased on my research into antifa groups, I believe its true that most, if not all, members do wholeheartedly support militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it this week. Im also confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance during this dramatic rebellion, he wrote. Yet it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups because members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right, and concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small. Basically, there are nowhere near enough anarchists and members of antifa groups to have accomplished such breathtaking destruction on their own.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked about Barrs statement that it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left-extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, said the truth is nobody really knows. He said on NBCs Meet the Press on May 31 that there had been very suspicious behavior, including cars with no license plates.\nIve talked to people who are demonstrating, some of them say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota. And they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it, Ellison said.\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said those cities were investigating who was responsible for the violence. Were working to get to the bottom of that right now, Carter said on CBS Face the Nation.\nIt looked differently racially in our city than our normal protests looked, Bottoms said on the same show. And it was  it was just it was a different group. So we dont know who they were, but many of them were not locally based.",

Floyd pleaded that he couldnt breathe. Protesters across the country for several days have chanted calls for justice for Floyd. Some people have looted stores and set police cars and other property on fire.\nTrump and allies say that a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups are anarchists and responsible for the destruction. \"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,\" Trump tweeted May 31.\nIts not an established fact that antifa supporters are the ones  or only the ones  looting or destroying property. Other groups are also under suspicion. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said on May 30 that \"largely peaceful protests\" have turned to \"outright looting and domestic terrorism in our region.\" He added: \"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.\"\nPolitiFact decided to examine the legal grounds for Trumps statement of designating antifa as a terrorist organization. National security experts said there is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. Also, antifa isnt an organization with an official leader or membership.\nTrumps statement \"is somewhat of an empty threat,\" said Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justices Liberty & National Security Program.\nIf the Trump administration sought a way to make that designation, its likely to be challenged in court, experts said. \"He has previously issued executive orders that weren't likely to survive legal challenge, so the lack of authority for such a designation may not stop him,\" German said.\nRELATED: The death of George Floyd: What you need to know\nWhat is antifa?\nAntifa is a term used for a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times resorting to violence. The antifa movement goes back decades, but regained attention after antifa groups counterprotested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\nAntifa is not an organization with an official membership, leader, or base for operations. So when Trump said he would designate antifa as a terrorist organization, its unclear who exactly his administration would be targeting or what kind of consequences that label would carry. The White House did not respond to our request for information.\nThe State Department and Treasury Department make designations to the Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, but there is no equivalent government list for domestic terrorist organizations.\nWhen the government designates a person or group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, its members are inadmissible to the United States, and their assets and money in the United States are frozen so they dont have access to it.\n\"There is a process to designate international groups as foreign terrorist organizations, but Trump is clearly directing his ire toward local activists, not anyone involved in anti-fascist organizing abroad,\" German said. \"Antifa isnt organized in that fashion in the first place, as it has no leaders, assets, or infrastructure, so banning material support to foreign anti-fascist groups would have little legitimate anti-terrorism effect here or abroad.\"\nAttorney General Bill Barr in a May 31 statement said, \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\"Domestic terrorism\" is defined in federal law, but the term itself does not exist as a federal crime. In domestic terrorism investigations, prosecutors end up charging suspects with offenses such as hate crimes, murder or weapons violations.\nFederal law defines domestic terrorism as acts dangerous to human life that violate the criminal laws of the United States or of any state, and which appear to be intended to:\n intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\n affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\nThe FBI adds ideology into its definition for domestic terrorism: violent, criminal acts \"to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\"\nReporters on June 1 asked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany what legal authority Trump would use to designate antifa as a terrorist organization and how members of antifa would be identified.\nMcEnany did not directly answer the question.",

It did not come from Clinton's verified Twitter account. It appears to have been created and shared as millions braced for the powerful storm. Dorian pummeled the Bahamas, hovering over the northern part of the Caribbean country for more than three days before moving off and threatening states in the U.S. southeast region.\nThe fake tweet plays on long-standing, wide-ranging conspiracy theories about the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons. The foundation's recovery-assistance efforts in Haiti after a devastating 2010 earthquake have also been the source of a number of unfounded claims.\nClinton, who served as secretary of state during the Obama administration and was President Donald Trump's Democratic rival in 2016, did not write the above tweet.

It purported that on her first full day in office, Harris had threatened that \"we will use federal law enforcement and the military\" against \"Trumpers ... [who] will beg me for a loaf of bread\":\nThese Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, its time to end this. They really dont get.

Such controversial comments certainly would have been widely reported, yet a simple search turns up not a single related news account. Nor did any similar statement appear in Harris' social media accounts or in White House briefing room statements.\nThe meme claims the statement in question was made on Jan. 21, the first full day of the Biden-Harris administration, but Harris' recorded events that day were speaking briefly to the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting (during which she made no such comments) and participating in a call with World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHarris had delivered her first speech as vice president the day before, on Inauguration Day, but in that address she made no mention of former President Donald Trump or his supporters.\nBecause we could find no evidence whatsoever of this quotation's being legitimate, we rate this item \"False.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

His family confirmed that he died early this morning at General Acute Care (GAC) Hospital in California barely [a] couple of hours after he was rushed to the hospital.\nThe article is riddled with errors and fabrications, such as California's \"General Acute Care Hospital\", which does not exist, and a fake tribute from President Donald Trump. Moen's collaborator  Nigerian Christian Contemporary music artist Frank Edwards  confirmed the report is a hoax, tweeting a screenshot of a text message sent by Moen's son Michael, who wrote:\nDad is great and it good health. That article is false and just trying to get people to click thru [sic] to their website. I'll have dad post something on social media shortly so people know.\nOn the day the fake article was published, Moen posted to Facebook.\nThe story itself contains several hallmarks of being fake: an invented hospital; a dubious cause of death (\"stomach pain\") is followed by the contradictory claim that the cause of death was \"not immediately known\"; a quote from Donald Trump is not attributed to any source; a quote from the pastor T.D. Jakes is attributed to \"local media\" but no specific source is named.\nHoustonChronicle-TV.com is not in any way associated with the Houston Chronicle newspaper.",

On 3 December, @HansReloaded tweeted images of what looked like a bread knife disguised in a modified baguette and described as \"Bladed weapons confiscated from rioters by the Paris police\":\nThe tweet was widely promulgated on both Twitter and Facebook, with many users (whether or not they actually took the \"weapon\" to be authentic) reveling in the stereotype-affirming use of a baguette in the context of violent crime:\nThe photographs posted by @HansReloaded did not originate in the gilets jaunes protests of November and December 2018, and could be found online well before that period.

It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

Here is one example, with the Twitter user's name cropped out for privacy reasons:\nFirst off, Biden didn't sign an executive order granting China access to or control over the U.S. power grid system. Biden signed an executive order suspending for 90 days an order by his predecessor, Donald Trump, that bars installation of equipment purchased from foreign adversaries into electrical infrastructure, so Biden's administration officials could evaluate Trump's order.\nBut that doesn't mean Biden gave China access to U.S. power grids. We will explain below.\nThe U.S. is served by three electrical grids  one that interconnects the western half of the U.S. and western Canada, another that interconnects the eastern half of the U.S. and eastern Canada, and a third grid that is the independent system serving most of Texas. These, along with a fourth grid serving Quebec, are usually referred to as the bulk-power system (BPS).\nOn May 1, 2020, Trump signed an executive order entitled \"Securing the United States Bulk-Power System.\" Trump's order prohibited the purchase and use of bulk-power system electrical equipment \"designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary\" to mitigate what it said was the potential threat of a cyberattack by foreign adversaries hacking into U.S. electrical systems.\nOn Dec. 17, 2020, Dan Brouillette, Trump's secretary of energy, issued a prohibition order stemming from Trump's May 1, 2020, executive order. Brouillette's order \"prohibits utilities that supply critical defense facilities (CDF) from procuring from the Peoples Republic of China, specific BPS electric equipment that poses an undue risk to the BPS, the security or resilience of critical infrastructure, the economy, national security, or safety and security of Americans.\"\nIn other words, Brouillette's order barred equipment purchased from China from being used in critical electrical infrastructure in the U.S.\nOn Jan. 20, 2021, Biden signed an executive order entitled, \"Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.\" The order suspended Trump's May 1 order for 90 days.\nDuring those 90 days, Biden's order directs the U.S. secretary of energy and director of the Office of Management and Budget to \"jointly consider whether to recommend that a replacement order be issued.\"\nThat does not mean that, while the order is suspended, China has 90 days of free access to electrical grids serving the United States. The U.S. Department of Energy said that during the suspension, utility providers must still refrain from installing equipment specified in Brouillette's prohibition order:\n[During] this 90-day review period, Responsible Utilities will refrain from installation of bulk-power system electric equipment or programmable components specified in Attachment 1 of the Prohibition Order that is subject to foreign adversaries ownership, control, or influence, and that Responsible Utilities will continue to work with the Department on identifying and mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities. To ensure that security of the Nations bulk-power system is strengthened during this suspension, the Department requests that Responsible Utilities designate critical defense facilities as a priority load in the applicable system load shedding and restoration plans.\nThe Texas power grid is independently operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), taking its policy direction primarily from state officials, not the federal government.\nThe Texas power grid didn't fail because of interference by China or any other external entity. It failed because when the state experienced Arctic temperatures that it isn't used to experiencing, demand for electricity spiked beyond what the grid was prepared to handle. State officials also failed to weatherize power-generating infrastructure from cold temperatures, which resulted in problems like natural gas supply lines and wind turbines freezing.\nWe reached out to the White House seeking further clarification on this subject but didn't get a response in time for publication. We will update this story when and if we hear back.",

        "content": "Claim:\nChester Bennington and Chris Cornell were murdered because they were about to reveal a ring of pedophiles.\nOn 21 July 2017, the junk news website Your News Wire (now News Punch) published a story reporting that Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, who passed away on 20 July 2017 in his Palos Verdes Estates home near Los Angeles, had been murdered in similar fashion to his friend, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, who died two months earlier.\nBoth Bennington's and Cornell's deaths have been ruled suicides by hanging by Los Angeles County and Wayne County medical examiners, respectively. Cornell died on 18 May 2017 in his hotel room after a concert in Detroit, while Bennington passed away at his Palos Verdes Estates home on 20 July 2017. The two men were friends  in fact, Bennington took his life on what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday. But rumors that their deaths were connected in any nefarious way are based on speculation and not evidence, and Your News Wire's headline thus falsely proclaims \"Police: Chester Bennington Was Murdered.\"\nCiting a \"police source,\" Your News Wire asserted that authorities were investigating Bennington's death as a homicide:\nDetectives are looking into whether Chester Bennington was murdered, with the death scene later arranged to resemble a suicide. They have put a team of investigators in place and are refusing to rule out a criminal homicide charge.\nMurders are sometimes made to look like suicides. We think he was murdered, we just have to find out who was behind it, said a police source.\nIt's unclear what \"detectives\" Your News Wire could possibly have obtained such a quote from. Palos Verdes Estates police have not commented on the case and have instead referred all inquiries to the coroner's office. The police department for that small coastal community south of Los Angeles contracts with the much larger Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to handle homicides, and the Sheriff's Homicide Bureau told us they did not respond to Bennington's death. The quote doesn't appear in any other news report about the incident.\nWe have spoken to all the agencies that have jurisdiction over Bennington's home and can confirm that, contrary to what Your News Wire reported, law enforcement has not said Bennington was murdered.\nThe celebrity status of both men means relevant details about their deaths are publicly available. Cornell's autopsy report has been uploaded online, and in that report, Wayne County assistant medical examiner Dr. Theodore Brown notes that Cornell's bodyguard discovered him in the bathroom of his Detroit hotel room with an exercise band around his neck. Ligature marks were found around Cornell's neck, and the cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging.\nThe Los Angeles County Coroners told us the official cause of Bennington's death was also a suicide by hanging and that an autopsy report would be forthcoming at the end of July 2017.\nYour News Wire also quoted Randy Cody, a person they described as an \"investigator\":\nDetroit police wrapped up their investigations quickly and the Wayne County Medical Examiners Office ruled the death a suicide, but investigators are claiming that unexplained gaps in the official timeline of Cornells final moments and suspicious inconsistencies in the records suggest that Cornells death was not suicide at all, but a premeditated homicide and cover up.\nInvestigator Randy Cody is among those questioning the suicide ruling. He points to perceived timeline gaps, forensic questions and what he says are two signs that Cornell had a head wound that was not mentioned in autopsy reports.\nCody may be an amateur sleuth, but he is not a law enforcement investigator. He is a blogger who runs The Metal Den web site, where he occupies himself coming up with various theories to prove Cornell was murdered. He was interviewed for a Detroit News story about theories surrounding the singer's death by fans unsatisfied with the suicide ruling, which is where Your News Wire lifted this information from.\nA piece of supposed evidence cited by Cody is a head wound he believes he saw in a YouTube video of Cornell's last performance at Detroit's Fox Theater on 17 May 2017 and an unverified recording of radio traffic in which a medic claimed to have seen a wound on the head of an unnamed victim. No mention was made of a head wound in the autopsy report, prompting accusations that the information was \"suppressed.\" However in the image from the concert it appears the \"wound\" is simply red stage light reflecting off the singer's skin.\nIn a 22 May 2017 post, Cody claimed Cornell was murdered because he was about to expose pedophiles involved in PizzaGate, a debunked conspiracy theory holding that a child sex trafficking ring linked to Hillary Clinton was being run out of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. No evidence was offered linking Bennington to the non-existent PizzaGate conspiracy other than a circumstantial reference to a revelation he made in a rock magazine interview that he had been molested when he was a child. PizzaGate has been debunked by none other than conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who was one of the key figures in originally spreading it. Jones apologized and retracted the claim after a man intent on \"rescuing\" children went to the pizzeria with a rifle in December 2016 and opened fire inside.",

        "content": "Claim:\nThe 1990s movie \"Shazaam\" starred comedian Sinbad as a genie.\nOrigin\nA popular internet theory holds that actor David Adkins, better known as the comedian Sinbad, played a genie in a popular children's movie released sometime in the 1990s called \"Shazaam.\"\nThe movie Shazaam, from the 1990s, staring Sinbad was never a real movie. Myself and thousands of others remember watching this movie, but apparently it was never made.\nI've tried looking it up myself and haven't found anything about it. There is an article about the oddity that was on Facebook. Someone commented a screenshot of the vhs in the comments, but again, I could not find this picture on the internet myself.\nAlthough this movie does not actually exist, social media users have circulated an image in an attempt to fool viewers into believing the film is real:\nThe \"genie\" in the above-displayed image actually features the chest and arms of WWE wrestler Chavo Guerrero, with Sinbad's face digitally added to the scene:\nDespite the total lack of evidence that any such film starring Sinbad was ever made  no extant footage, no still shots documenting its creation, no news articles or movie reviews mentioning it, it has no entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and Sinbad himself has stated that he never played a genie in a movie called Shazaam  many people still they remember seeing the movie.\nBut why?\nWhile we cannot pinpoint an exact origin of this collective false memory, several circumstantial aspects suggest why people may mistakenly recall Sinbad's having starred in a genie movie.\nThe name: Depending on when you grew up, the name \"Sinbad\" likely recalls memories of one of two things: either a popular 1990s comedian, or a fictional sailor who had adventures (sometimes involving genies) in the Middle East. It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.\nSinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\" on TNT in 1994:\nKazaam: A simpler explanation is that some fans are misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s that featured a popular actor playing a genie. In 1996, Shaquille O'Neal essayed the role of a genie in the film \"Kazaam\":\nSinbad appeared in several popular childrens' movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for Kazaam was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie The First Kid:\nIt appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of the \"Mandela Effect,\" an informal term for a collective false memory. The term was coined by a woman who discovered that she and hundreds of other people believed, and remembered, that Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s. Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa's first black president and winning the Nobel Peace Prize (along with another former president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, who ended the system of segregation known in South Africa as apartheid during his time in power) in 1993  all of which, of course, would have been impossible if Mandela had been dead for a decade.\nSightings:",

The pictures included in the e-mail show engine fan blades that have suffered foreign object damage (FOD) such as encountering a bird strike or a hail storm, and the \"seatbelts\" are tie-down straps used to secure the engine to a shipping stand as it is removed from the aircraft for inspection, repair, or replacement.",

He told you 9/11 led my country to abandon its ideals, particularly in the Middle East. He told you that the United States and the Muslim world needed 'a new beginning.' The results of these misjudgments have been dire.\"\nPompeo said that the U.S. was \"timid\" about \"asserting ourselves when the times  and our partners  demanded it.\"\nThe secretary did not mention Obama by name but the remarks still struck listeners in the U.S. as unusually partisan.\n\"It's a speech shocking for its use of domestic politics, for kind of attacking a prior president in an international setting and for going to a long-time ally and questioning some of the foundations of the relationship with the ally,\" said Heather Hurlburt, an analyst with the New America, a nonpartisan think tank. \"Those are all things that secretaries of state don't normally do but seem to becoming standard practice with Pompeo.\"\nPompeo's speech came on the third leg of a nine-nation Mideast tour aimed at reassuring America's Arab partners that the Trump administration is not walking away from the region amid confusion and concern over plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria.\nFormer Obama administration officials rejected Pompeo's assertions as petty, political and weak. They said the speech pandered to authoritarian leaders and ignored rights violations that Obama had called out.\n\"That this administration feels the need, nearly a decade later, to take potshots at an effort to identify common ground between the Arab world and the West speaks not only to the Trump administration's pettiness but also to its lack of a strategic vision for America's role in the region and its abdication of America's values,\" National Security Action group, a group of former officials, said in a statement.\nRob Malley, who was Obama's national security council director for the Middle East and is now at the International Crisis Group, said hearing Pompeo's speech was like \"like listening to someone from a parallel universe\" in which the region's shortcomings were ignored.\n\"In that parallel universe, the Arab public probably will receive it enthusiastically,\" he said. \"Back on planet earth, they will see it for what it is: a self-congratulatory, delusional depiction of the Trump administration's Middle East policy.\"\nPompeo blamed the previous administration's approach to the Mideast for the ills that consume it now, particularly the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and Iran's increasing assertiveness, which he said was a direct result of sanctions relief, since rescinded by the Trump administration, granted to it under the 2015 nuclear deal.\nHe said Obama ignored the growth of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon to the detriment of Israel's security and not doing enough to push back on Iran-supported rebels in Yemen.\nSince Trump's election, however, Pompeo claimed this was all changing.\n\"The good news is this: The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering,\" he said. \"Now comes the real 'new beginning.' In just 24 months, actually less than two years, the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region, because we've learned from our mistakes.\"\nIn the speech entitled \"A Force for Good: America's Reinvigorated Role in the Middle East,\" Pompeo extolled the Trump administration's actions across the region cementing ties with traditional, albeit authoritarian, friendly governments, taking on the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and imposing tough new sanctions on Iran.\n\"President Trump has reversed our willful blindness to the danger of the regime and withdrew from the failed nuclear deal, with its false promises,\" Pompeo said.\nSince withdrawing from the nuclear deal last year, the administration has steadily ratcheted up pressure on Tehran and routinely accuses the nation of being the most destabilizing influence in the region. It has vowed to increase the pressure until Iran halts what U.S. officials describe as its \"malign activities\" throughout the Mideast and elsewhere, including support for rebels in Yemen, anti-Israel groups, and Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\"The nations of the Middle East will never enjoy security, achieve economic stability, or advance the dreams of its peoples if Iran's revolutionary regime persists on its current course,\" Pompeo said.",

A police officer said at least 15 people had died.\nIt is terrible. What I have seen is terrible, said Charles Njenga, who ran from a scene of blood, broken glass, burning vehicles and pillars of black smoke.\nAl-Shabab  the Somalia-based group that carried out the 2013 attack at the nearby Westgate Mall in Nairobi that left 67 people dead  claimed responsibility for the carnage at the DusitD2 hotel complex, which includes bars, restaurants, offices and banks and is in a well-to-do neighborhood with many American, European and Indian expatriates.\nA Kenyan police officer said 15 bodies had been taken to the morgue. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. The U.S. State Department confirmed that an American citizen was among those killed, but did not release the victims identity. Al-Shabab asserted that 47 people were killed but its Shahada news agency post gave no details.\nAuthorities sent special forces into the hotel to flush out the gunmen. Early Wednesday, Kenyas Interior Ministry said in a tweet that all buildings had been secured and there was no further threat to the public. Hours later, at dawn, another explosion and gunfire were heard. The Interior Ministry said authorities were mopping up the scene but did not given details on the fate of the attackers.\nTo God be the Glory. We have been rescued. Over 50 people in my group. No injuries Thank you all for the support and prayers. Thanks You KDF, tweeted a Kenyan businesswoman, Aggie Asiimwe Konde. KDF stands for the Kenya Defense Forces.\nLucy Wanjiru said she had been trying to flee when she saw a woman on the ground floor get shot. Wanjiru ended up in a washroom with several other scared people. Her friend Cynthia Kibe stayed in contact with her by phone overnight.\nI think I panicked when she told me that the gunshots are next to her, Kibe said. I had to keep telling her Just wait, help is on the way, they are almost there, they are almost there. And then at one point she was like, Please tell me I am getting out of here alive and then it was just like my breaking point.\nAuthorities did not say how many attackers there were  or what happened to them  though Kenyas Citizen TV aired security-camera footage that showed at least four heavily armed men in dark-colored, paramilitary-style gear.\nA police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media said bodies were seen in restaurants downstairs and in offices upstairs, but there was no time to count the dead.\nA witness who gave his name only as Ken said he saw five bodies at the hotel entrance. Other people were shouting for help and when we rushed back to try to rescue them, gunshots started coming from upstairs, and we had to duck because they were targeting us and we could see two guys shooting, he said.\nThe coordinated assault began with an explosion that targeted three vehicles outside a bank, and a suicide bombing in the hotel lobby that severely wounded a number of guests, said Kenyas national police chief, Joseph Boinnet.\nSurvivors reported hearing a shattering blast and saw people mowed down by gunmen as they sat in a cafe. Victims were left slumped on tables.\nWe were changing our shifts, and that is when I heard a loud blast and people were screaming, said Enoch Kibet, who works as a cleaner at the cafe and managed to crawl out a basement gate. I couldnt believe I was alive. The blast was so loud and shook the whole complex.\nKenyan hospitals appealed for blood donations even as the number of wounded remained unclear.\nAssociated Press video from inside the hotel showed Kenyan security officers searching the building and scared workers emerging from hiding while gunfire could still be heard. Some climbed out a window by ladder. One man got up from the floor where he appeared to be trying to hide under a piece of wood paneling, then showed his ID.\nAs officers searched luxury fashion displays, wounded people were carried away on stretchers.\nLike the attack at the Westgate Mall, this one appeared aimed at wealthy Kenyans and foreigners. It came a day after a magistrate ruled that three men must stand trial in connection with the Westgate Mall siege.\nAl-Shabab has vowed retribution against Kenya for sending troops to Somalia to fight it since 2011. Tuesdays violence came three years to the day after al-Shabab extremists attacked a Kenyan military base in Somalia, killing scores of people.\nThe al-Qaida-linked group has killed hundreds of people in Kenya. In the deadliest attack, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for an assault on Kenyas Garissa University in 2015 that killed 147 people, mostly students.\nThe latest carnage demonstrated al-Shababs continued ability to carry out spectacular acts of bloodshed despite a dramatic increase in U.S. airstrikes against it under President Donald Trump.\nTourism  an important source of revenue in Kenya, East Africas largest economy  has suffered because of the violence.\nGunfire could be heard for hours after Tuesdays attack began. Some people ducked behind cars, screaming, while others took cover behind fountains and other features at the lush complex. A bomb disposal unit was called in, and police blew up a car they said had explosives inside. A grenade was seen in a hallway.\nDozens of people were rushed to safety as plainclothes officers went from shop to shop in the complex. Some people held up their hands to show they were unarmed.\nA Kenyan intelligence official said the country had been on high alert since November, with information about potential attacks on high-profile targets in Nairobi. The official was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nDespite the repeated attacks, the Kenya-Somalia border remains porous, with al-Shabab extremists able to easily bribe their way across, according to a U.N. panel of experts.\nThe hotel complex, owned by Thailands Dusit International chain in Nairobis Westlands neighborhood, is about a mile (2 kilometers) from Westgate Mall on a relatively quiet, tree-lined road in what is considered one of the most secure parts of the city. The hotels website says it is cocooned away from the hustle and bustle in a secure and peaceful haven.\nOn Monday, the hotel promoted its spa by tweeting: Is your new year off to a rough start?\n___\nAssociated Press writers Abdi Guled in Nairobi, Kenya, and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed.\n___",

The act denotes the bison as Americas national mammal and a historical symbol of the United States.\nThe eagle will reportedly still represent the nation, but it will no longer be the sole animal doing so. If passed, the bison will join the bald eagle, the oak, and the rose as a symbol for our country.\nDespite the title, the actual story was primarily based on factual information. The National Bison Legacy Act, which designated the bison as the national mammal of the United States, was passed by Congress at the end of April 2016. But while this legislation will give the United States its first national mammal, it will have no effect on the bald eagle's status as the United States' national bird, nor as its national symbol.",

The Feds then closed the courtroom doors.\nThe claim that El Chapo testified in court that he gave \"Killary\" Clinton, Pelosi, and Schiff millions of dollars did not originate with a news report, a courtroom transcript, or from anyone with inside knowledge about this case. This claim appears to have originated with a baseless Facebook post from \"Shane Vandiver,\" the bassist and singer for a Texas music group.\nOn 9 February 2019, Vandiver posted the message to his Facebook page: \"Drug kingpin El Chapo testified that he gave MILLIONS to Pelosi, Schiff & Killary. The Feds then closed the courtroom doors.\" It was the earliest (and most popular) iteration of this message that we could find.\nVandiver's post was not presented with any supporting evidence. He did not include any links to news articles, videos, interviews, or transcripts. His post was also suspiciously void of specifics, such as how much these politicians were paid, what they were paid for, and how these transactions were completed.\nStill, many social media users took this baseless assertion as fact and spread it to their followers. Within three days of its initial posting, it had racked up nearly 30,000 shares:\nThis claim is not based on any factual information. It was made up in an apparent attempt to stir up controversy and smear Democrat politicians.\nThis rumor is also suspicious for another reason: El Chapo did not testify during his trial.\nEl Chapo was extradited to the United States in January 2017 to face a litany of criminal charges, including money laundering, drug trafficking, firearms violations, operating a criminal enterprise, and conspiring to murder rivals. When his trial officially began more than a year later in November 2018, prosecutors talked to more than 50 witnesses over 11 weeks to lay out their case.\nEl Chapo's defense, on the other hand, involved just one witness, lasted about 30 minutes, and did not feature testimony from the drug kingpin:\n(Associated Press): Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman told a judge Monday that he won't take the witness stand in his own defense at his U.S. drug-trafficking trial, ending speculation that he might go for broke and build on a notorious reputation already cemented by the sprawling government case against him.\n\"Your honor, me and my attorneys have spoken about this . and I won't testify,\" Guzman said through a Spanish interpreter in a rare instance of him standing up and speaking in court.\n(Reuters): Accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin El Chapo Guzman said in court on Monday that he will not testify in his own defense at his U.S. trial.\nGuzman announced his decision after prosecutors rested their case against him in federal court in Brooklyn. After excusing the jury, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan asked Guzman directly whether he understood it was his decision, not that of his lawyers, to testify or not.\nYes, but they counseled me about it and I agree with them, Guzman answered.\nHad Guzman, 61, testified, it would have provided a fitting climax to an already dramatic trial. However, Guzmans decision was widely expected, as testifying would have exposed him to cross-examination by prosecutors.\nIn other words, El Chapo couldn't have testified that he gave millions of dollars to Clinton, Pelosi and Schiff because El Chapo did not testify during his trial.",

        "content": "The budget that President Trump proposed Monday takes a hard whack at the poorest Americans, slashing billions of dollars from food stamps, public health insurance and federal housing vouchers, while trying to tilt the programs in more conservative directions.\nThe spending plan reaches beyond the White Houses own power over the government social safety net and presumes lawmakers will overhaul long-standing entitlement programs for the poor in ways beyond what Congress so far has been willing to do.\nThe changes call on lawmakers to eliminate the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and transform the rest of that program into a system of capped payments to states; convert food assistance into a hybrid of commodity deliveries and traditional cash benefits; and expand requirements that low-income people work to qualify for federal assistance.\nAdvertisement\nWere very encouraged by their approach to reforming the welfare state, both to taxpayers and the people on these programs, said Akash Chougule, director of policy for the libertarian group Americans for Prosperity. Were encouraged by the presidents rhetoric and recent actions.\nCongress has final say over spending  but Mondays budget proposal is seen as an important sign of Trumps priorities.\nSpecifically, the Trump budget proposal would gut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, by $17.2 billion in 2019  equivalent to 22 percent of the programs total cost last year  and implement a boxed food delivery program, a system that White House budget director Mick Mulvaney compared to Blue Apron.\nThe proposal would bring a fundamental change to a program that for the past 40 years has allowed recipients to use SNAP benefits at grocery stores as if they were cash. SNAP provides an average of $125 per month to 42.2 million Americans.\nWhat's getting cut in Trump's budget\nAdvertisement\nUnder the full-scale redesign, the Agriculture Department would use a portion of those benefits to buy and deliver a package of U.S.-grown commodities  officially dubbed Americas Harvest Box  to recipients, using the governments buying power to lower costs.\nThe deliveries of government-purchased foods would account for roughly half of the benefits for the vast majority of SNAP households.\nThe foods in the deliveries would include shelf-stable milk, juice, grains, cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans, and canned meat, fruits and vegetables, according to USDA. The department estimates that it could supply these goods at roughly half the cost of retail, slashing the cost of SNAP while still feeding the hungry.\nAdvocates for the hungry said they are skeptical of the plan and unclear how it would work for people with specialized diets, or whether USDA would allot the same foods to, say, an elderly diabetic and a family with young children.\nAdvertisement\nThe presidents budget proposes to replace in significant part the very successful current system of having SNAP recipients use EBT cards to purchase food through grocery stores, supermarkets, farmers markets, and other normal commercial channels with a Rube-Goldberg designed system of commodity distribution via food boxes that will be administratively costly, inefficient, stigmatizing, and prone to failure, and that will return the country to Depression-era anti-hunger approaches, Jim Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, said in a statement.\nThe proposal is also likely to enrage food retailers  particularly Walmart, Target and Aldi  which stand to lose billions if food-stamp benefits are cut, analysts say. On Monday, the Food Marketing Institute, a trade association for grocery stores, condemned the Harvest Box proposal as expensive, inefficient and unlikely to generate any long-term savings.\nTrumps budget proposal calls for additional cuts of more than $213.5 billion over the next decade to SNAP, a reduction of nearly 30 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nAdvertisement\nMany of the administrations proposed SNAP reforms are familiar. The budget suggests restricting states ability to issue food stamps to unemployed adults, even in areas where few jobs are available. Itrecommends eliminating SNAP nutrition education programs, raising the age limit for SNAP recipients no longer required to work, and capping the benefit amount for large families of six or more.\nThe push to institute broad work requirements also extends to families receiving housing vouchers, expanding on moves by nearly a dozen states to require Medicaid and food stamp recipients to work.\nThe reforms at the Department of Housing and Urban Development were intended to encourage the dignity of work and self-sufficiency and chart a new course for the future of public housing, the document said.\nAdvertisement\nTrumps proposed budget for the 2019 fiscal year includes a 14 percent cut to HUD, amounting to $6.8 billion below the agencys current $48 billion spending. Thats an even deeper cut than his previous years proposal, which had been the most dramatic cut to HUD since the early 1980s.\nThe proposal would eliminate the entire fund for public housing capital repairs, a savings of nearly $2 billion a year. The cut comes at a time when public housing faces a $40 billion backlog of capital needs, said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. In New York City, about 80 percent of public housing tenants suffered heating and hot water outages in recent months because the aging boiler systems are in desperate need of repair, Yentel said.\nTrump also proposed cutting a federal housing subsidy program, known as Section 8 vouchers, by nearly $1 billion, which Yentel said would affect more than 250,000 low-income families.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed HUD budget, like last year, would eliminate funding for Community Development Block Grants, which play a key role in disaster recovery, as well as grants to states and local governments to increase homeownership for the lowest-income Americans.\nOn health care for low-income Americans, Trumps budget calls for cutting federal Medicaid funding substantially over the coming decade. This would occur, in part, by eliminating the Medicaid expansion adopted by nearly three dozen states under the ACA to allow residents with slightly higher incomes to join the program  something Congress would need to approve.\nIn addition, the budget would end Medicaids half century as an entitlement, in which the federal government gives each state a certain share of the expense of covering every resident who is eligible. Instead, the program would be converted to a system in which the government provided either a block grant or a per-person cap, while freeing states from federal rules for medical benefits and eligibility. Yearly increases would be tied to inflation  which typically rises more slowly than spending on medical costs.\nAdvertisement\nTo pay for part of this switch, the spending plan also would, starting in 2021, end the subsidies that help more than 4 in 5 Americans with ACA marketplace coverage pay for their insurance premiums.\nThe contours of these health-care changes are patterned after a Senate Republican proposal to repeal the ACA, sponsored primarily by Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), that failed last fall.\nDan Mendelson, president of the Washington-based health-care consulting firm Avalere Health, said the Medicaid parts of the budget are rhetorical, because consensus does not exist in Congress for changes of this scale. But Mendelson, a former OMB official during the Clinton administration, said that other parts are more realistic, including an experiment with allowing a few states to create formularies, sidestepping a rule that requires Medicaid to pay for every drug on the market.\nAdvertisement\nAll of the deep cuts to the social safety net that Trump proposed last year were rejected by Congress on a bipartisan basis, and the budget bill passed by Congress last week increased spending amounts in discretionary programs. But Yentel said she fears the cuts in Trumps budget proposal lower the bar for whats considered acceptable.\nThe presidents budget request is always considered dead on arrival in Congress, especially in an election year, Yentel said. My concern is that it leaves open a space for a compromise to be less severe but still a significant cut to programs.",

Donald Trump believe Americans became lazy with all of the government assistance programs that the government offer the people. Donald Trump recently said \"Americans will no longer be able to be lazy, and depend on the government to take care of them\".\nMany working American believe a lot of government assistance programs need to be abolished. One of them programs are Section 8. Why do a such program exist anyway? Well Donald Trump doesn't believe in any of it and believe working citizens of America would like to see their tax money being spent in better ways than taking care of able working Americans that simply refuse to. Even though there are working Americans that are on Section 8, 75% of Section 8 recipients go through numerous jobs, and some refuse to work at all.\nAnother program Donald Trump doesn't believe in is Welfare. Although he openly admitted that he see the point in the program, he don't think Americans understand that if should be used to help those get on their feet instead of a reliable source of income. He believe American need to recreate jobs and recreate American Businesses that other countries are now benefiting from.\nThe article's lack of any substantiating material should have been a clue that it was not a real story. Had Trump made any sort of divisive or racist assertion of the sort (such as implying that social programs like Section 8 housing exist solely to benefit black people), those comments would have been unquestionably newsworthy in the wake of his upset victory in the 2016 election.\nUnited States presidents are not vested with the power to either create or pass laws on their own:\nThe president does not have the power to create or rewrite legislation  that is Congresss job. He is not authorized to dispense with or suspend the law. British kings made this practice familiar to the Framers of the Constitution, who deliberately chose to deny such a power to the president ... lets start by referring to the Constitution. Article II charges the president with the duty to carry out the law  to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.",

She tweeted multiple times on Oct. 3, but none mentioned impeachment or anything sexually suggestive.\nWe also searched Lewinskys Twitter handle @MonicaLewinsky in the All My Tweets database, which compiles users tweets in a single webpage, and could not find anything from Lewinsky on Oct. 3  as the screenshot shows  that references impeachment, Trump or oral sex.\nAnother red flag demonstrating that the tweet is fabricated: An advanced Twitter search of its keywords came up with (almost) no results. For a viral tweet that has supposedly garnered thousands of retweets and likes, only one similarly-worded tweet from a user who isnt Lewinsky showed up on the platform.\nWe reached out to Lewinsky for comment, but havent yet heard back.\nWe know enough, though, to rate this faux tweet Pants on Fire!",

        "content": "Claim:\nA picture shows a new animal species that's \"taking over\" at Chernobyl.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn January 2021, a picture of a strange, four-legged animal appeared in an online advertisement about the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear-reactor disaster in Ukraine. The ad claimed: \"There Are a New Animal Species Taking Over at Chernobyl.\"\nEncyclopedia Brittanica published that the Chernobyl incident was \"the worst disaster in the history of nuclear power generation.\" History.com reported much the same:\nChernobyl is a nuclear power plant in Ukraine that was the site of a disastrous nuclear accident on April 26, 1986. A routine test at the power plant went horribly wrong, and two massive explosions blew the 1,000-ton roof off one of the plants reactors, releasing 400 times more radiation than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The worst nuclear disaster in history killed two workers in the explosions and, within months, at least 28 more would be dead by acute radiation exposure. Eventually, thousands of people would show signs of health effectsincluding cancerfrom the fallout.\nHowever, the clickbait picture in the ad did not depict a \"new animal species\" that was \"taking over at Chernobyl.\" The resulting 30-page slideshow article didn't even mention the photograph.\nIn reality, it showed a spectacled (hairless) Andean bear named Dolores.\nOn Nov. 5, 2009, BBC reported that Dolores and two other bears were dealing with \"various states of baldness.\"\nThey came \"from the Andean mountains of Ecuador, Peru, and northern Bolivia.\"\nThe bears - named Dolores, Bianca, and Lolita - are suffering from itchiness as well, so animal keepers apply ointments to soothe their skin.\n\"This problem with the spectacled bears is not just in Leipzig [Zoo],\" Mr. Noetzhold told the BBC World Service. \"There are other zoos in Europe and overseas having the same problem. And so we've had an international working group of zoo vets looking at this for some time already.\"\nGerard Baars, director of the International Bear Foundation, said he had never seen such a condition before. \"I could hardly believe it is a bear although I have been dealing with bears all my life,\" he told the BBC's Europe Today programme.\nThe picture in the advertisement was perhaps chosen for the reason mentioned by Baars. Even the director of the International Bear Foundation didn't know it was a bear. Readers who saw the ad likely wouldn't initially identify the animal as a bear, either.\nJan Woitas and the European Pressphoto Agency were credited for the photograph that was used in the ad. It appeared to be from 2009.\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/germany-animals-nov-2009-8209359b\nAlso on Nov. 5, 2009, the Associated Press posted a video of Dolores, Bianca, and Lolita at the Leipzig Zoo. The zoo official, who was not identified, spoke of research that was underway about the issue with the bears. He also mentioned that other zoos had seen similar problems with such bears.\nAt least two blogs mentioned that Dolores died in 2011. We were unable to confirm this information with any credible source. However, one thing we can say for sure is that she was not a \"new species\" that was \"taking over at Chernobyl.\"\nFor further reading, Scientific American reported on the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in December 2020. The story looked at the possibility of \"lingering radiation effects on animal populations.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video captures a cat with an extremely deep meow.\nIn May 2017, a 2015 video featuring a cat with an unusually deep voice inexplicably went viral, and was duly picked up by various tabloids:\nDont let this cats small stature fool you  he has a bass voice that would put Barry White to shame.\nIn a video filmed by the kittys owner, hes just chilling on the kitchen counter. Unsurprisingly, his ridiculously low voice has gone viral, with a lot of people wondering how its physically possible for such a tiny cat to produce such a noise.\nThere are several reasons to be skeptical about this footage. The video was originally posted to YouTube by \"Cash CatFlava\" in December 2015, bearing the description \"So this is Jack and he has some sort of type of laryngeal paralysis? At least thats what the vet told me.\"\nSome cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: \"While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat's meow, I've yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat's meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn't change over time!\"\nAccording to the American College of Veterinarian Surgeons, a cat with laryngeal paralysis may display harsh panting or a coarse (not deeper) voice:\nIn dogs and cats with laryngeal paralysis, the muscles that normally pull the airway open do not function properly. When an affected pet breathes in, the walls of the airway do not pull openrather, they are sucked into the opening, or in severe cases sucked shut. Early in the condition, this creates increased noise when they breathe; later, it can completely obstruct their airway, and they can suffocate. The early signs of laryngeal paralysis can be quite subtle.\nYou may notice:\nharshness in their panting\nincreased panting or panting when cool and calm\na hoarse or raspy-sounding bark\nA video of a cat suffering from laryngeal paralysis shows that their meows are not comically deep, but squeaky (and arguably a little sad):\nOur attempts to find similar videos of cats with unusually deep voices were unsuccessful. In fact, the only similar video we could uncover was uploaded by the same YouTube account, Cash Cat Flava, in October 2013:\nSetting aside for the moment what a coincidence it would be that the same person has come across two cats with laryngeal paralysis who sound identical, this video actually gives itself away as a fakery in the first few seconds. Before the cat exits the house, you can hear audio of its actual regular-pitched meow.",

Bleaching occurs when algae that live inside corals and give them their color are expelled  either due to increased sea temperatures or extreme weather events.\nREAD: 2015: Youre making this island disappear\nThe bleaching is extreme in the 1,000 km (600 mile) region north of Port Douglas all the way up to the northern Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea, says Andrew Baird of the ARC Centre.\nAt some reefs, the final death toll is likely to exceed 90%. When bleaching is this severe, it affects almost all coral species, including old, slow-growing corals that once lost will take decades or longer to return.\nLike 10 cyclones\nProfessor Terry Hughes, who convened the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, likens the current extent of bleaching in the northern reef as like 10 cyclones have come ashore all at once.\nThe study surveyed 900 of the individual reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef, from the air and underwater, building up a picture of a hugely varied extent of damage along the length of the reef.\nREAD: Opinion: Oceans are more vital than you think\nThe worst of the bleaching is in the northern third of the reef, which is one of the countrys most important tourist sites. Of the reefs surveyed in this sector, 81% are characterized as severely bleached.\nTragically, this is the most remote part of the reef, and its remoteness has protected it from most human pressures: but not climate change, Baird says.\nHalf of all corals dead\nNorth of Port Douglas, were already measuring an average of close to 50% mortality of bleached corals. At some reefs, the final death toll is likely to exceed 90%, Baird says.\nWhen bleaching is this severe, it affects almost all coral species, including old, slow-growing corals that once lost will take decades or longer to return.\nREAD: Will climate change cause an ocean food chain collapse?\nThe extent of bleaching lessens gradually toward the southern end of the reef, with only 1% of the southern sector, roughly a third of the reef, classed as severely bleached. However, even in this relatively unaffected area, only one quarter of reefs were considered unbleached.\nReef tourism generates an annual income of A$5 billion ($3.9 billion), the report says, and employs nearly 70,000 people.\nEl Nio has likely played a large part in the coral bleaching events this year in the Great Barrier Reef, as well as in Hawaii and Fiji. El Nio is characterized by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and El Nio years frequently contain the worst bleaching in Pacific region reefs.\nEffects of climate change\nBut coral bleaching is also the most widespread and conspicuous impact of climate change, according to the U.N.s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Events like this one in the Great Barrier Reef are effects of climate change that scientists have predicted and feared.\nCoral reefs are important to ocean ecosystems and continued bleaching events from ocean warming and acidification will damage reef-based fisheries and increase exposure to coastlines from waves and storms. It also will damage economies that depend on ecotourism, such as those in Australia and the Caribbean.\nREAD: Dramatic images reveal coral bleaching in Great Barrier Reef\nThe Great Barrier Reef has experienced two major bleaching events in recent decades, in 1998 and 2002. The extent of the bleaching during these summers, however, pales compared with this years findings.\nDuring 1998 and 2002, 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs were affected by bleaching.",

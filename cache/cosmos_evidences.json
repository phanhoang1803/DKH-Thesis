        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earths surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earths surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earths surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earths surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earths atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earths surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

They were also due to undergo medical checks.\nParents were overjoyed to be reunited with their sons. \"I couldn't believe what I heard until neighbours came to inform me that it's true,\" one mother told Reuters news agency.\n\"I'm so excited,\" said another mother who been waiting anxiously with other parents after seeing her boy, 15. \"I have to cry, the cry of joy when I saw him,\" she told AFP news agency.\nOne boy told a TV station the group had been fed bread and cassava during their captivity and that it had been cold. He said he was \"really happy\" to be back in Katsina.\nAddressing the freed children, Governor Masari said: \"You suffered physically, mentally and psychologically, but let me assure you that we suffered more and your parents suffered more.\"\nEarlier he had told media: \"I think we have recovered most of the boys- it's not all of them.\"\nHow was the release secured?\nThe government insists no ransom was paid but that the boys were released after negotiations with the kidnappers.\nZamfara state governor Bello Matawalle, in whose state the boys were released, told the BBC that three separate negotiations had taken place before the students' freedom was secured.\nThey were released in Tsafe town in Zamfara on Thursday evening, authorities say.\nMr Matawalle told BBC Hausa that during the negotiations the kidnappers had raised various grievances.\n\"Among their complaints was how people kill their cattle and how various vigilante units disturb them,\" the governor said, adding that the government had promised to look into the complaints of the kidnappers.\nConflict between herders and farming communities are common in Nigeria's central and north-western states, says the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Lagos.\nBoth groups have been warring for decades but deadly clashes have increased in recent years as farming communities and herdsmen have employed armed vigilantes, especially in Nigeria's north-west.\nA spokesman for Governor Masari, Abdul Labaran, told the BBC the boys had been held by bandits.\n\"It wasn't Boko Haram,\" he said. \"The local bandits we know about all along were responsible. These are people we know very well, I met some of their leaders. That is why an umbrella body of cattle breeders' association was used in contacting them. So the negotiation was made through this umbrella body of cattle breeders.\"\nHow did the school attack unfold?\nWitnesses say armed men raided the school in Kankara last Friday evening. Many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots.\nSome were tracked by the gunmen, who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once these students were rounded up, they were marched into the nearby forest by the armed men.\nOn Thursday, video was released bearing Boko Haram's emblem, showing dozens of boys, some of whom appeared to be very young.\nOne of the boys said they had been taken captive by \"the gang of Abu Shekau\". Abubakar Shekau leads Boko Haram, a group notorious for school kidnappings, including one in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized.",

These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall. This year there were only 6 metres of snow that guided us to Tsuta Onsen.\nAccording to a sightseeing guide for the Aomori region of Japan, the Hakkoda Walls are quite a tourist attraction. Heavy snowfalls frequently close the corridor during the winter, but when the spring season approaches the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad gets to work and clears the road:\nNational Highway 103, commonly known as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line, is a popular sightseeing route in Aomori.8 km of this Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line stretching from Sukayu to Yachi Hot Springs is closed off in winter, but thanks to the efforts of the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad, they plow through the snow from both ends to meet at Kasamatsu Pass in late March, creating a stunning snow corridor.\nIn some places the walls of snow reach a height of 9 m, allowing visitors to enjoy magnificent views of the vivid blue of the sky contrasted against the white of the snow in perfect harmony.\nThe road opens to general traffic on April 1, but before this, a Hakkoda walk is held every year to walk through this snow corridor, and many people take part in the event.",

However, its possible  at least in theory  that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says its looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist!

        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

        "content": "Claim:\nSnopes.com ignored reports of a large child trafficking ring bust in Arizona.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 7 June 2018, Neon Nettle  a web site that frequently weaves nonsensical allegations into its stories  pushed out a disingenuous article maintaining that we had \"ignored\" a huge child trafficking bust:\nSnopes has 'debunked' recent allegations of a child trafficking camp made by veterans even though it has been reported that the FBI has rescued 60 children as part of a massive pedophile ring bust.\nThe fact-checking site said that the story about the discovery of an Arizona child trafficking camp was completely \"false\" with all references to it on social media hidden.\nThe sting saw 150 child traffickers snared along with approximately 160 children rescued, some as young as 3 years old.\n\"They are crimes of special concern to the FBI and to law enforcement generally,\" [FBI special agent Matt] Alcoke said. \"Because the victims are so vulnerable as children and because the offenders could be from just about any walk of life, from a gang member all the way up to someone who is highly successful and wealthy.\"\nThis passage reproduced an accurate quote from a real FBI agent speaking about a legitimate trafficking bust  but that bust was part of an FBI sting operation which took place in Atlanta, 1,700 miles away from the site of the debunked \"child trafficking camp\" in Tucson. Neon Nettle deliberately and misleadingly conflated these two stories to make is seem as if we were disclaiming a successful child trafficking raid in Georgia rather than debunking a false report of child trafficking in Arizona.\nThe FBI sting in Atlanta, code-named Operation Safe Summer, was specific to the state of Georgia and had nothing to do with the false report of a \"child trafficking bunker\" allegedly discovered by a group in Arizona:\nNORTH FULTON COUNTY, GA.  A sting on the sex-trafficking trade in metro Atlanta netted dozens of arrests and the rescue of dozens of children forced into sexual servitude, the FBI announced this week.\nOperation Safe Summer was a collaborative effort between the FBI's Atlanta field office and 38 law enforcement agencies in six metro counties, assistant Special Agent in Charge Matt Alcoke told Channel 2's Mike Petchenik.\nThe Neon Nettle story was apparently sourced from fellow conspiracy theorists The Free Thought Project, who engaged in similar deceptive headlining:\nAs Snopes 'Debunks' Child Trafficking Camp, 160 Kids as Young as 3 Rescued in Georgia\nAfter Snopes called allegations of child trafficking made by a veterans group a 'conspiracy theory', 160 children, as young as 3-years-old, were rescued from traffickers in Georgia.\nFree Thought Project insinuated, in an impressive combination of logical fallacies, that because we (and others) debunked the false \"pedophilia bunker\" in Arizona story, we must not believe child trafficking exists anywhere in the world at all:\nSnopes  whether deliberately or not  is actively engaging in censorship of content that could actually help children by engaging others and fostering discussion. Instead of allowing the discussion to continue, Snopes deliberately shut down the conversation, insuring that the very important topic of child trafficking is forced into the memory hole and never heard of again.\nAs the above case illustrates, child trafficking is a horrifying reality. While Pizzagate scenarios may not be real, there are far worse incidents taking place across the country.\nChild trafficking is, indeed, a horrifying reality, which is why we choose to cover it responsibly rather than making the job of law enforcement and advocacy groups immeasurably more difficult by irresponsibly propagating false information about child trafficking (as sites such as Neon Nettle and the Free Thought Project do).\nFor example, the \"veterans' group\" that stumbled across the abandoned homeless camp on private property in Tucson decided that the presence of child's toys at one end of the camp and pornographic magazines elsewhere was obvious evidence of child sex trafficking, rather than ordinary detritus left behind at a temporary site where those migrating from one region to another chose to stop for a while and perhaps have a moment or two alone to tend to some rather common needs.\nThat group also decided (again, without any evidence) that straps tied around trees were \"restraints\" for holding children in bondage, rather than for some other more prosaic use, such as tying up tarps to provide shade from the relentless Arizona sun. When local and federal authorities investigated the site and found nothing but an abandoned homeless encampment, the same \"veteran's group\" immediately accused law enforcement of orchestrating a massive cover-up.",

        "content": "Claim:\nThe National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a quiet admission that marijuana kills cancer:\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe report in question is the NCIs Physician Data Query (PDQ) on Cannabis and Cannabinoids. The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as marijuana kills cancer.\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the overview section:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells  including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet admission of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added quietly in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ prove that cannabis kills cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not prove anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be cured by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has no currently accepted medical use, which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Governments official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal governments center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI admitted that cannabis kills cancer uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way prove that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

This picture actually shows a tooth that was artistically mounted by a fossil seller.\nThe photograph was originally posted on Reddit in July 2012 under the title \"The newest addition to my museum of a house: a megalodon tooth stuck in a whale vertebrae!\" Users were skeptical of the image, however, and noted that similar items could be purchased on eBay for relatively low prices.\nThe original poster asked their father, who had purchased the item, about it an returned to the thread with this reply:\nMy dad just came home and I asked him, and his response was, \"It's a real tooth and a real vertebra from a whale, but are you kidding me?! Of course the guy put them together! If it originally came like that, it would be worth millions of dollars and be in a museum!\" So yea, they are both real, but the tooth was not originally lodged in there -.-\nAnother picture showing a megalodon tooth embedded in a whale bone can be found on the web site Fossilera, where it is accompanied by a similar explanation: The tooth and the bone are both authentic, but the tooth was artistically mounted in the bone before it was sold. Fossilera similarly noted that it is highly unlikely anyone would discover a genuine fossil of megalodon tooth and a whale bone connected in this fashion:\nThis is a fossil Megalodon tooth which has been artistically mounted in a fossil whale cervical (neck) vertebrae, representing predator and prey. Whales were one of the main prey items on the Megalodon, their fossilized bones often bear tooth marks, and Megalodon teeth often show significant feeding damage from striking bone due to feeding.\nRealistically the massive bite forces would have caused the tooth and/or the vertebrae to fracture, so you wouldn't naturally have a intact tooth embedded in a bone like this. But, it makes for a cool, and conversation starting display.\nFossils Online also has an example of a megalodon tooth embedded in a whale bone. Again, this item is accompanied by a description which noted that the \"tooth has been placed in the vertebra\":\nInteresting display piece. Paperweight for someone's office? Book end? The tooth has been placed in the vertebra. This was not found like this. On very rare occasions, the tip of a shark tooth is found imbedded in whale bone. Bite marks are usually left behind, but rarely a tip of a tooth is found. This shows the interaction between the two species in a more artistic fashion. The vertebra measures approximately 5 1/2\" tall.",

This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

        "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994  and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork  depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries  was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\nThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994, the posts read. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airports public art available on the airports website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is not from DENs art collection. The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. Its called Children of the World Dream of Peace, but it doesnt include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting  posted by Trinidad days earlier  on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece Maskcommunication.\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, United Against Corona- Express through Art, by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the [d]ate of submission as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February  though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name NEHA appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting  and well update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994  and its false to say that its a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

The painting does not belong to the Denver airport art collection and has not been displayed there. The image of it began circulating online in February of this year.\nTHE FACTS: Social media posts that have been viewed thousands of times this week claim a painting of children wearing masks adorned with national flags first appeared at the Denver airport in 1994.\nThe posts use the claim as evidence the COVID-19 pandemic was planned.\nThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994, one Twitter user said. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nA Facebook post went even further into the false conspiracy theory, posting an image of the painting with the caption, Illuminati art works on display.\nHowever, these posts are not correct.\nThe communications office at the Denver airport told The Associated Press in an email that the painting in question is not an image from the airports art collection.\nThe only mural painted in 1994 for DEN featuring international children wearing traditional clothing and that also features flags is Leo Tangumas Children of the World Dream of Peace, but there are no kids wearing masks, said Alex Rentera, a public information officer for the airport.\nWhats more, the image was not circulating on the internet before this year. In a reverse-image search, the AP found that the oldest posts available are from February 2020.\nA Filipino artist named Christian Joy Trinidad painted the work, which he called Maskcommunication.\nThe artists Instagram account features a photograph of the painting, which confirms that the version on Facebook has been edited. The version spreading online features a boy wearing a mask with an Israeli flag. But in the original, that boy is actually wearing a mask with a Palestinian flag.\nThe AP contacted Trinidad and he confirmed through an Instagram message that he created the painting for a contest in late February.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson contributed to this report from Seattle.\n__\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

        "content": "Claim:\nIn late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed whereby motorists were tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the road, as part of a prevalent sex-trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Yall See Anything Like This, Dont Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Dont Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"",

        "content": "TOKYO (AP)  Japan marked the 13th anniversary of the massive earthquake and tsunami that triggered a nuclear meltdown and left large parts of Fukushima prefecture uninhabitable on Monday with a minute of silence and memorial events, where officials pledged continued support for rebuilding.\nThe 9.0 magnitude quake and tsunami that ravaged parts of Japans northeastern coast on March 11, 2011 killed about 20,000 people and drove thousands from their homes in the prefectures of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima.\nAt 2:46 p.m.  the time when the earthquake struck  people across Japan stopped to observe a minute of silence. In Tokyos central Ginza shopping district, people stopped to pray on the sidewalk as a bell rang out, marking the moment.\nIn the town of Minamisanriku in Miyagi prefecture, a team of 10 uniformed police officers sifted though gravel and sand on the beach in an annual search for the remains of people who are still missing. Survivors prayed by the bare girders that used to be the towns disaster prevention center, where dozens died. In the town of Natori, about 400 people prayed and released balloons carrying messages of grief.\nIn Ishinomaki City in Iwate prefecture, residents gathered in a hilltop park where many of them took shelter 13 years ago, mourning as they stood facing the sea. In Rikuzentakata, about 100 people prayed atop a massive concrete seawall.\nAnd at a ceremony in Fukushima prefecture, where some 20,000 people still cannot return to their homes because of radiation, Gov. Masao Uchibori vowed that rebuilding will continue as the decades-long work of cleaning up the nuclear site continues.\nWe will not give up, he said. I pledge in front of the quake and tsunami victims that we will accomplish recovery at any cost.\nA wall of water over 15 meters (50 feet) tall slammed into the coastal Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, destroying its power supply and cooling systems, triggering meltdowns in three of its six reactors, and spewing radiation across the surrounding areas.\nThe disaster initially forced more than 160,000 people to leave their homes. Work to remove highly radioactive melted fuel debris has still not begun at the plant, and the overall decommissioning project is expected to last decades.\nAt the ceremony in Fukushima, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida renewed a pledge that the government will help secure jobs, livelihoods and the safe decommissioning of the plant so the former residents can return home.\nWe will continue to do utmost for the full-fledged recovery and rebirth, as well as the recovery of the northeastern region, he said.\nMost deaths from the tsunami and earthquake took place in Miyagi and Iwate prefectures, north of Fukushima, but they have been able to recover faster because they were not exposed to nuclear waste. The reconstruction of roads, seawalls and other infrastructure has been largely completed in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures, but many former residents have not returned due to the loss of communities.\nThis years memorial events also remembered victims of the devastating quake that struck Japans north central region of Noto on Jan. 1, which triggered renewed calls for a review of evacuation plans nationwide, including around nuclear plants.\nKishida later told reporters the government would work to ensure the ruined Fukushima Daiichi plant is decommissioned safely and transparently, citing recent mishaps including a contaminated water leak within the plant complex.\nIn a step the government and TEPCO say is crucial for decommissioning, the plant started releasing treated radioactive wastewater into the sea last August. The controversial discharges have faced protests by local fishers and neighboring countries  especially China, which has banned Japanese seafood imports.\nNational memorial services have not been held in Tokyo since the 10th anniversary, and municipalities in the disaster-hit areas now host local services each year.",

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of bombs were dropped on Britain during World War Two, some of which never exploded, so perhaps it should not be a surprise that they are still being found more than 75 years after the end of the war. But how much do we know about them?\nThe discovery of an unexploded World War Two bomb in Exeter resulted in a military response, thousands of residents being evacuated from their homes and extensive damage to nearby properties.\nAfter being discovered on an allotment due for development, the 2,200lb (1,000kg) German bomb was blown up on Saturday in a controlled explosion, leaving a crater the size of three double-decker buses.\nResidents have all been allowed back into their homes but many of the properties are \"uninhabitable\" according to Exeter City Council. About 300 students are still waiting to be allowed back into their accommodation.\nThe BBC has spoken to a series of experts about the wider questions surrounding unexploded ordnance.\nHow did the bomb get there?\nExeter was the first victim of the Baedecker Raids on English cultural centres during World War Two, made in response to the British bombing of Lbeck.\nThe raids were named after the Baedeker guidebook used by the German military to select historic targets in England.\nThe Blitz of Exeter in April and May 1942 \"was the single most destructive event in the city's history since at least the attack by the Vikings in 1003\" said Dr Todd Gray.\nThe historian from the University of Exeter said the recently discovered bomb most likely fell during one of these attacks, when the city was targeted for morale rather than for strategic purposes.\nNearly 300 people died, more than 1,700 buildings were destroyed, 7,000 high explosives and incendiary bombs were dropped and 40 high explosive bombs did not detonate.\nThe sound of the bomb being exploded on Saturday was \"ferocious\", but Dr Gray said he felt \"quite thankful\" to have heard the noise as a reminder of what it would have been like at the time.\n\"That bomb going off reminds us what that generation in 1940s went through,\" said Dr Gray.\n\"It's sobering, but now and then something like this is good for us to think about.\"\nThe bomb was discovered near Exeter St David's railway station in an area not covered by a \"bomb census\".\n\"There's bound to be I would have thought one or two more somewhere,\" he added.\nCould there be more nearby?\nEmily Charles, a World War Two curator at the Imperial War Museum said the exact number of bombs across the country was not known and it was \"really hard\" to work out where unexploded bombs could be.\nThe allies kept a detailed record of bomb damage inflicted on British cities during the war called the bomb census, said Ms Charles.\nThey created maps to show the most damaged areas, which can give historians a \"better picture\" of where unexploded ordnance could be, she added.\nThe most common type of bomb used in the Blitz was about 500lb (226.8kg), meaning the 2,200lb (1,000kg) bomb detonated in Exeter was \"particularly large\" said Ms Charles.\nHowever, she stressed it was \"not uncommonly large\" and bombs of this size had been found in recent years.\nCould they explode?\nA guide on managing the risk of unexploded devices was released by the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) in 2019.\nThe CIRIA guide said ordnance could be reactivated by either direct impact, vibration or heating.\nThe lack of fatalities in instances when construction teams discover unexploded devices \"is particularly because of the Germans commonly using electrical fuses in WW2 that stopped functioning when the battery expired\", said the guide.\n\"What makes unexploded bombs dangerous is their unpredictability,\" said Ms Charles.\nShe told the BBC there were \"not huge scientific studies\" on how explosives degraded or whether they got more deadly over time.\n\"So I think the best course of action is to treat them as if they are deadly.\"\nThat the bomb was detonated in a controlled explosion and houses suffered damage, proves they can still be dangerous, she said.\nThere are multiple reasons that bombs do not detonate upon landing, explained Ms Charles, such as faulty fuses, defects or the way they land.\nShe said people should call the police if they spot any suspected explosive devices.\nHow much is there across the country?\nThe Ministry of Defence says since 2010 it has been involved with making safe 450 German WW2 bombs - about 60 a year, the BBC Reality Check team revealed in 2018.\nHowever, these figures do not factor in the involvement of private companies that can also dispose of unexploded devices.\nThis can make it difficult to establish exact figures for how many are dealt with each year across the country.\nA specialist from one such private company, Zetica UXO, told the BBC that since World War Two \"45,000 unexploded bombs have been found and more are being found all the time\".\nOfficial records, which can often be understated, predicted around \"200,000 plus bombs were detonated\" during the war said Mike Sainsbury.\nHe said it was estimated that \"another 10% or so\" did not explode.\nHow to detonate an unexploded bomb?\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson said explosive ordnance teams from the Royal Navy and Army worked with local authorities to safely dispose of the bomb.\nMilitary teams worked for 24 hours to build protective structures and trenches to minimise the impacts of the blast and used more than \"400 tonnes of sand\" to mitigate the explosion.",

Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, its an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

Her characters have permeated music, but in a new version of the film A Star Is Born, she plays Ally, an unknown singer-songwriter who meets Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper). He wants to make her a star  yet another character for Gaga to inhabit while re-orbiting her own music.\nBoth the movie and the soundtrack come out Oct. 5, but until today, we'd yet to hear any of the songs, which promise to span styles. Now we have the first single, the slow-burning power ballad \"Shallow.\"\nCountry music was a texture in Lady Gaga's 2016 album Joanne. But as NPR Music's Ann Powers put it in her review, country music is \"a genre sometimes strangled by authenticity myths,\" which sets the stage for exactly the kind of \"definitions-busting\" that Gaga favors.\n\"Shallow\" sets the stage for a quiet, reflective country croon, the recording opting to keep in audience noise and their rapturous response. Bradley Cooper, with a sweet and amiable set of pipes, trades verses with Gaga about finding more, wanting more out of life and lovers. But then Gaga's theater kid comes roaring in at the chorus: \"I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in / I'll never meet the ground,\" growling the last word as if every rejection, every ex, every barrier embodies it.

One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA single eruption from a volcano puts 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity has throughout history.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nThe myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate.\nIn a 2009 editorial written for Australias ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: \"Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.\"\nThis brief statement  a mere 28 words  yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic cough? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimers second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality.\nThat useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere.\nAs CO2, in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate  a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus.\nThe erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimers statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center:\nAccording to Houghton and Hackler, land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.\nThe 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2.\nA more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes, as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year (note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO2 not solely the carbon component):\n[CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]:\nUsing the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2.\n[CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]:\nExtrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr.\n[CO2 from other volcanic sources]:\nPerez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr.\nWhile the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year:\nThe global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr.\nOnce again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimers claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic cough from a single volcano to, by itself, increase Earths annual volcanic CO2 flux by a factor of 65.\nAbsurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way:\nThere is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours.\nHowever, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\nOrigin\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\" This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City policy  commonly referred to as the global gag rule. The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot  unlike the global gag rule  be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that bodys sexual and reproductive health agency whose mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled.\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the domestic gag rule  a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. Organizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services, the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations. Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  President Joe Biden on Thursday rescinded a regulation that barred U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform or promote abortions. His decision, while expected, was cheered by abortion-choice advocates and some humanitarian groups and denounced by anti-abortion groups.\nThe move also included a restoration of American funding to the U.N. Population Fund and withdraws the U.S. from an international accord that promotes anti-abortion policies. The steps came just a week after he was inaugurated and fulfills a campaign pledge to reverse a policy that previous Republican presidents, including his immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, had instated immediately on taking office.\nThe policy  known as the Mexico City rule, after the place where it was first announced at an international population conference, or the global gag rule  has been a political ping-pong ball, bouncing back and forth between Republican and Democratic presidents since it was first enacted in 1985 during President Ronald Reagans second term.\nThese excessive conditions on foreign and development assistance undermine the United States efforts to advance gender equality globally by restricting our ability to support womens health and programs that prevent and respond to gender-based violence, Biden said in a memorandum to his Cabinet.\nThe expansion of the policy has also affected all other areas of global health assistance, limiting the United States ability to work with local partners around the world and inhibiting their efforts to confront serious health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others, he said. Such restrictions on global health assistance are particularly harmful in light of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAccompanying Bidens determination was a decision to restore funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which Trump had ended over its alleged support for forced abortions and sterilizations in China. The fund has denied those allegations. The year before Trump terminated the funding, the U.S. had provided $69 million to the UNFPA.\nIn addition, Biden directed the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw from the so-called Geneva Consensus, an October 2020 document signed by 34 countries that sought to promote anti-abortion policies and others deemed pro-family worldwide. The consensus had been co-sponsored by the U.S. and was signed by numerous nations critics consider to be undemocratic or authoritarian.\nCritics of Trumps policies say they had hurt womens reproductive health care and contributed to poverty worldwide. Supporters argue they are essential to preserve the sanctity of life.\nTrump had expanded the Mexico City rule to include nearly all federal health funding, but its effects were felt most abroad, where U.S. assistance can be an essential part of a countrys health care spending.\nAlthough supporters of the policy argue that the overall amount of U.S. health care aid was not affected, critics maintain it contributed to a rise in pregnancy-related complications as well other issues by forcing some clinics to reduce broader health services, including for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious diseases, if they wanted to retain funding.\nReaction to Bidens decision was swift and sharp, even before it was officially announced. Abortion-rights groups and Democratic lawmakers hailed it as key to improving womens lives, while anti-abortion groups denounced it as immoral and unnecessary.\nThe Global Gag Rule has had a sweeping effect on lifesaving health care in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world, said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is shameful that the Trump administration chose to not only implement but exponentially expand this ill-conceived policy to historic proportions.\nShe called it an important first step to restore access to family planning services and mitigate the damage caused by an administration that pursued this dangerous policy without regard for its impact.\nDoctors Without Borders, which has spoken out against the Mexico City policy, welcomed the move but said more must be done to address the global health care crisis.\nWhile we are relieved to see a halt to this dangerous policy, there is much more work to do to mitigate the damage we have witnessed. Rescinding the Global Gag Rule is just a first step, it said. Millions of women still dont have access to safe abortion care because of restrictive laws, cost, stigma, a lack of trained providers, or other unnecessary barriers, such as mandatory waiting periods or misleading information.\nAnti-abortion groups and lawmakers were equally as strident in their condemnation.\nU.S. foreign policy  and the foreign entities we fund with billions of dollars in grant money  should consistently affirm, care for, and tangibly assist women and children  including unborn baby girls and boys, said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who has been one of the most vocal abortion opponents in Congress.\nFunneling U.S. tax dollars to abortion groups overseas is an abhorrent practice that flies in the face of the unity Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promised to inspire, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which seeks to elect anti-abortion candidates to Congress and other offices.\nEchoing the comments of others, she blasted the Biden administration for once again allowing taxpayer money to fund abortions, maintaining the move was payback for a group of abortion industry giants that support the presidents campaign for president.\nPushing abortion on other nations is not compassion, it is ideological neo-colonization, said Lila Rose of Live Action, a national anti-abortion group. This decision is a dark day for our nation  it will lead to more deaths of more children and for that, Joe Biden should be ashamed.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin made inaccurate statements to the media following their one-on-one talks in Helsinki about election meddling, global terrorism and nuclear nonproliferation.\nHeres a rundown of our fact-checks.\nTrump: Missing DNC servers and the Pakistani gentleman\nAsked if he believed Putins denials of election interference over his own intelligence agencies, Trump brought up \"missing\" servers of the Democrats, including a server of \"the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC.\"\nThe gentleman in question is likely Imran Awan, who worked in information technology for several Democrats in the House of Representatives. Awan was not affiliated with the DNC. Awan was arrested for bank fraud in July, prompting speculation among conservative groups that he had been involved with election hacking as well. A government investigation found no evidence that Awan was involved in wrongdoing in his IT job, or that he had any ties to election meddling.\nAs for the missing servers, the DNC gave the FBI a full copy of its server when they began working together to investigate the hack. In his June 2017 testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, former FBI director James Comey mentioned that the \"best practice\" is to inspect the affected machines directly, but that a copy could be used just as well.\nTrumps statement rates False.\nPutin: The Russian state has never interfered in American elections\nPutin said that \"the Russian state has never interfered into internal American affairs including election process.\" Pants on Fire!\nThis statement comes just days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\nAnd it contradicts the findings of the U.S. intelligence community, members of Trumps administration and the findings of Republican-led investigations by the U.S. House and Senate.\nNot only is there a mountain of evidence to show that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, there were also attempts by the Soviet Union to do so from as early as 1960.\nPutin: Browder associates donated over $400 million to Clinton campaign\nPutin said that associates of financier Bill Browder \"sent a huge amount of money, over $400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\" Thats also Pants on Fire.\nRussians say that Browder and his partners at Ziff Brothers Investments, a New York venture capital firm, illegally syphoned billions of rubles out of the country. Browder also led the charge to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, a U.S. law that penalizes Russian officials suspected of sanctioning the death of Browders lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison.\nWe checked campaign contribution records and found that associates of Browder  the Ziff brothers  gave $315,000 to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Putins estimate does not hold up when stretched to include their donations to the Clinton Foundation and its subsidiaries.\nPutin and Trumps relationship in 2013\nWhen asked if the Russian government had compromising material on Trump, Putin replied that he has heard about the rumors that he had gathered information on Trump during his 2013 visit to Moscow, for the Miss Universe pageant. Putin was firm that he did not know Trump was visiting, and that it would be absurd for him to have collected information on a businessman he did not know.\nThere are also reports that contradict what Putin claimed about the pageant. Rob Gladstone, a business associate of Trumps, said under oath that Putin had been considering attending the Miss Universe pageant and speaking with Trump, either in a meeting or over a call. The conversation never took place, but a corroborating report said that Putin sent a gift along with a note to Trump.\nIts possible that Putins spokesman could have been deciding on his own whether Putin should meet with Trump, without telling Putin.",

        "content": "Claim:\nThe TV show \"The Simpsons\" predicted the death of George Floyd.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn June 2020, a set of images started to circulate on social media supposedly showing screen grabs from an episode of \"The Simpsons\" in which the long-running animated show \"predicted\" the death of George Floyd, a black man whose death while in Minneapolis Police custody sparked nationwide protests:\nThese images do not show a \"prediction\" that \"The Simpsons\" made in the 1990s.\nThe image on the right showing Chief Wiggum kneeling on a black man's neck  a scene reminiscent of George Floyd's death  while Lisa Simpson stands by holding a \"Justice for George\" sign was created by Instagram user Yuri Pomo. This image did not appear in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" and it was posted to Pomo's Instagram account on May 30, five days after Floyd's death.\nPomo captioned the image on Instagram:\nNormally youre used to see colorful and cheerful drawings from me, but since ive got quite a good audience, id like to use it as much as i can in the right way when the situation requires it, and bring something good, and useful with my drawings, and you guys know it.\nEspecially in this exact moment.\nWith this piece id like you to think deeply, Taking the chance to bring The Simpsons as an example for the cause. The Simpsons has always been everyones childhood, so the message will be clear and strong enough i suppose.\nImagine youre sat with you daughter/son watching the Simpsons, and all of a sudden this scene happens in the show, as cruel as it has been, no jokes, no irony, nothing that the Simpsons normally has, and what its loved for. Imagine that, how would you feel? ... Think about that deeply, and give yourself an answer, no need to add anything else!\nThe above-displayed collage also implies that \"The Simpsons\" predicted that a police station would be lit on fire.\nAlthough a precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was truly set ablaze, the image in this collection does not show that fire. The photograph in the bottom left corner of this collection actually shows an unfinished housing complex. That photograph is available via The Associated Press and captioned as follows:\nA multi-story affordable housing complex under construction near the Third Precinct, burns on Wednesday, May 27, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minn. Protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer Monday. (Mark Vancleave/Star Tribune via AP)\nThe image on the top left, showing the Springfield police station on fire, truly does come from an episode of \"The Simpsons.\" However, this image has nothing to do with protests, riots, George Floyd, or police violence. Instead, it refers to a joke \"The Simpsons\" made about police incompetence.\nIn the episode \"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\" (Season 11, Episode 6), Homer decides to bypass traffic by driving along the grassy area next to the highway. He is pulled over by Springfield's Police Chief Wiggum, who asks: \"Alright smart guy, where's the fire?\"\nHomer replies \"over there\" and points to a flaming Springfield police station. Chief Wiggum responds: \"Okay, you just bought yourself a 317, pointing out police stupidity... Or is that a 314? Nah nah, 314 is a dog uh, in, no or is that a 315?... You're in trouble pal.\"\nWe have not been able to find a publicly available version of this clip to share in this article, but here's a GIF capturing the moment:\nIn sum, \"The Simpsons\" didn't predict Floyd's death or the resulting protests or fires. The image of Chief Wiggum kneeling on a black man's neck was shared in the days after Floyd's death and didn't appear in an official episode of the show. Although the image of the Springfield police station burning did come from an episode of \"The Simpsons,\" this clip had nothing to do with Floyd or the 2020 protests.",

        "content": "Claim:\nBefore his death, physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith after a visit with Pope Francis.\nThe renowned physicist Stephen Hawking died in March 2018 at the age of 76, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of science, as well as reflections on his inspirational life story.\nOn 14 March 2018, the \"Catholics Online\" Facebook page posted a photograph of Hawking meeting Pope Francis alongside a fabricated claim:\nBefore he died, Stiph [sic] Hawkins [sic] who did not believe in God requested to visit the Vatican. \"Now l believe\" was the only statement he made after the Holy Father blessed him.\nHawking was a longstanding and prominent atheist who often wrote and spoke about the origins of the universe and his views on the notion of a divine Creator (or rather, a lack thereof). As the Washington Post documented after his death, Hawking told the Guardian in 2011 that he did not believe in an afterlife or heaven:\nI regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.\nIn 2010, he told ABC News: \"One can't prove that God doesn't exist, but science makes God unnecessary.\"\nThere is no evidence that Hawking deviated from those lifelong views before his death, and he did not make any declaration of faith after a meeting with Pope Francis.The photograph in the Facebook post shows Hawking and Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016, the last time the two men met. Contrary to the claim, Hawking did not request a private visit with the pontiff; rather, he travelled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.\nHawking was a valued member of the academy, having been appointed to it by Pope Paul VI in 1968. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences listed has among its aims \"fostering interaction between faith and reason and encouraging dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical and religious values.\" After his death, the academy honored Hawking, tweeting a series of photographs of the physicist meeting Popes Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis.\nHowever, notwithstanding his decades-long commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself.\nHawking's phony deathbed conversion is one in a long series of similar hoaxes of opportunity. For example, after the 2011 death of the writer Christopher Hitchens  an outspoken atheist and critic of organized religion  American evangelical Christian writer Larry Alex Taunton published a controversial book in which he claimed Hitchens had reevaluated his religious faith while he was dying of esophageal cancer. The book was widely dismissed and fiercely criticized by friends of Hitchens. Before that, there were debunked eleventh-hour \"conversions\" to Christianity by Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution, and astronomer Carl Sagan.",

The photograph seen here is real, however -- but its explanation is an artistic rather than a miraculous one.\nThe person pictured here is artist Rob Ferrel of San Antonio, Texas, who uses a variety of media to create his artworks, including salt and other food products, as reported on Oddity Central:\nA true artist doesnt really need expensive tools and materials to produce something beautiful, and San Antonio artist Rob Ferrel is the perfect example. For months, he has been treating his Instagram followers with highly realist portraits that he creates using nothing but salt, a few brushes, and a piece of cardstock.\nFerrel begins by pouring salt on a table and then moves it around with brushes until recognizable features begin to emerge. He also uses cardstock for clean, sharp lines. Once the portrait is ready, he photographs it and posts it to Instagram, and then gathers up all the salt to make his next masterpiece.\nHis posts regularly get thousands of likes, but some of the more popular portraits are of Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, John Lennon, Lebron James, the cast of Fast & Furious, and The Notorious B.I.G, which he made on a wooden floor.\nBut its not just salt Ferrel works with. The young artist is so talented that he can produce breathtaking art out of pretty much anything. He runs a salon in San Antonio called Rob the Original Barbershop, where he gives customers crazy haircuts sculpted with logos, patterns, and celeb portraits.\nFerrel demonstrated his \"salt art\" during a television appearance on KRPC's Houston Life with hosts Derrick Shore and Courtney Zavala:",

You can hear it on this state broadcast.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Korean).\nMCEVERS: And the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, delivered a message.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nSUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).\nMCEVERS: He said, \"the entire area of the U.S. mainland is within our nuclear strike range. The United States can never start a war against me and our country.\" To talk about the speech, we have reached Evans Revere on Skype. He's an Asia expert and a former State Department official. Welcome to the show.\nEVANS REVERE: It's a pleasure to be with you.\nMCEVERS: Let's start with that statement that Kim Jong Un made about how the U.S. is now within nuclear strike range. I mean, how do you interpret this? What is he trying to do with this speech?\nREVERE: I think the bottom line that he's trying to convey to the United States but also to the international community is that North Korea is and is going to remain a nuclear weapons power. And that reality includes North Korea's ability not only to deter an American attack but to perhaps even threaten the United States itself with a nuclear attack.\nMCEVERS: Do you think this speech is also aimed at a domestic audience as well?\nREVERE: Oh, I think clearly there's a substantial element of domestic politics at work here. He says that the United States cannot attack me, which I thought was an interesting turn of phrase. He's also trying to tell his people that the United States no longer dares to attack North Korea, the DPRK, because North Korea has now, under his leadership, developed this nuclear deterrent.\nMCEVERS: Right. So the idea of the speech is this is the new reality, get used to it, but what about the specific claim that the weapons - that North Korea's nuclear weapons can now reach anywhere in the U.S.? Does that seem possible given what we've seen from North Korea's latest missile tests?\nREVERE: So my assessment of this is that while the threat is there in sort of the theoretical realm, as a practical reality, North Korea has not yet crossed the finish line in terms of actually and credibly being able to threaten the continental United States with a missile-borne nuclear weapon.\nMCEVERS: Yesterday on ABC's \"This Week,\" former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen said this.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\")\nMIKE MULLEN: We're actually closer, in my view, to a nuclear war with North Korea and in that region than we've ever been. And I just don't see the opportunities to solve this diplomatically at this particular point.\nMCEVERS: You have experience negotiating with North Korea on behalf of the U.S. government. Do you have a similar outlook about the possibility for diplomacy here?\nREVERE: Well, I have a similar outlook about the possibility of nuclear war. I think if you look at North Korea's position and you take it literally that they will never give up their nukes, if you look at the U.S. position and take it literally that we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed North Korea, the logical conclusion is that a confrontation of some sort is a distinct possibility - I hope it's not. I hope there is room for diplomacy and dialogue. I think getting to the point of dialogue is one of the things that the U.S. administration is doing now, which is an unprecedented application of economic, trade, diplomatic, political and other sanctions as a way of compelling North Korea, the DPRK, to rethink the course that it is on. We're in uncharted territory here. We've never gone down this track in quite this way when it comes to sanctions and other measures.\nMCEVERS: Of course, in this speech, Kim Jong Un also, surprisingly to some, called for direct talks with South Korea. What did you make of that?\nREVERE: I have been waiting since the Moon Jae-in government came into power...\nMCEVERS: In South Korea.\nREVERE: ...In 2017 for the North Koreans to do precisely what they have done - reach out to South Korea. They are, in their own way, trying to drive a wedge in between the South Koreans and the United States by attracting South Korea, the ROK, into a dialogue since the United States and South Korea have been pretty much in lockstep in applying massive pressure and isolation on North Korea.\nMCEVERS: Evans Revere, senior adviser with the Albright Stonebridge Group and a former State Department official.

        "content": "Claim:\nThe U.S. has a global trade deficit of $800 billion.\nOn 8 March 2018 President Donald Trump repeated an often-derided claim regarding the U.S. trade deficit during a press conference in the White House.\nThe president said that the country currently has a global trade deficit of $800 billion  a statement he has reportedly made more than 50 times since 2015. The remark at the press confrence came one day after he repeated the claim on his Twitter account. However, as news outlets have pointed out, that figure leaves out the fact that the U.S. has a trade surplus. As a report released by the Commerce Department shows, the actual deficit is $566 billion:\nThe report said:\nThe 2017 increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of $57.5 billion or 7.6 percent to $810.0 billion and a decrease in the services surplus of $3.7 billion or 1.5 percent to $244.0 billion.\nA report published by the White House in February 2018 stated that the U.S. economy has become more dependent on trade involving \"private service-producing industries\" such as engineering, travel, and finance among others:\nTravel (including that for educational purposes) has constituted the largest share of U.S. services exports. Services trade between countries has continued to grow  given declining travel costs, improvements in telecommunications, and growth in online services that allow, for example, computer coding to take place in remote locations. This allows the United States to export high-skilled services to other countries that do not share our\nexpertise and training advantages.\nFocusing on trade of tangible goods alone, the report added, ignored the country's \"comparative advantage\" in service-related trade.\nTrump reiterated his misleading claim on the same day he officially imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum, respectively. Mexico and Canada  the country's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement  are exempted from those tariffs, and other countries will be allowed to petition for separate exemptions. The president's plan to impose the tariffs led to the resignation of White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn on 6 March 2018.",

        "content": "Claim: The US is suffering from a trade imbalance, with a trade deficit of $800bn (579bn) in 2017.\nReality Check verdict: The President is incorrect about the US trade deficit - it was $566bn (410bn) in 2017. Economists generally agree that neither trade deficits nor surpluses are necessarily 'good' or 'bad' for an economy.\nIn a marked change of direction from his predecessors and decades of American trade policy, US President Donald Trump signalled a shift away from free trade towards more protectionist policies by signing two proclamations which levied significant tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium into the United States.\nPart of his justification for the move was his belief that US trade deficits have hurt the US economy.\nIn remarks at the White House announcing the trade tariff plan, President Trump said \"we lose $800bn (578bn) a year on trade, every year\".\nIt's a claim he's made repeatedly, in tweets and speeches.\nWhat's he referring to?\nPresident Trump seems to be citing the fact that the US imported $810bn worth of goods in 2017. That was what he referenced in a June 2016 campaign speech in Pittsburgh, which many in his administration are pointing to now to suggest they've fulfilled a campaign promise.\nBut in doing so, he's ignoring the amount of services the US exported in 2017, which totalled $242.7bn.\nDiscounting that contribution to US trade ignores a significant part of what makes the US economy tick.\nThis is why most economists agree that the US trade deficit in 2017 was $566bn (410bn).\nLike many developed economies, the US has shifted over the past century from an economy primarily focused on manufacturing goods to one that is primarily composed of services. The service sector accounts for 90 million US jobs and 80% of US economic activity, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe biggest US service exports were travel and tourism, financial services like banking, and environmental services.\nWhat about China?\nIn the White House speech, and in recent days, President Trump has taken particular aim at China - saying the US is losing out because of a $500bn trade deficit with China, which he also mentioned during a 5 March speech.\nHowever, the US has never run a trade deficit with China that is above $337bn.\nOver the past ten years, the US has run an annual trade deficit with China that's hovered between $200bn and $300bn.\nAnd when it comes to steel and aluminium imports to the US, China barely ranks.\nAlthough China has nearly half of the world's steel-making capacity according to the OECD, the US imports the majority of its steel from Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico.\nIn 2017, Chinese steel imports accounted for just 2% of the 34 million tonnes of steel the US imported, or 3% of the total value.\nManufacturing jobs lost\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose accept and continue.\nA big reason President Trump has pursued these tariffs is his desire to appeal to manufacturing workers in Democratic swing states like Ohio. He has specifically said he wants to see the US return to being a country that \"makes\" goods.\nIn the past, he's cited statistics that he says indicate that poor trade policies have hurt the US manufacturing sector overall.\nFor instance, in a tweet earlier in the week President Trump said that since President George H.W. Bush came into office in 1989, the US has lost 55,000 factories and six million manufacturing jobs.\nAccording to the US Census bureau, the US actually lost a total of 77,314 manufacturing establishments from 1989 until 2014 (the last year for which data is available).\nHowever, establishments can encompass anything from a traditional factory to something like a bakery or a candy store, so it is hard to definitively say if more than 70,000 factories were lost in the intervening decades.\nIn terms of manufacturing employment, these numbers are slightly exaggerated. The US lost a total of 5.5 million manufacturing jobs since 1989.\nUS manufacturing employment peaked in 1979. It suffered its sharpest declines in employment in the early 1980s. Since then, manufacturing employment in America has been on the decline.\nSome of the decline is certainly due to unfair trade practices - but a large portion of it could be due to automation, which has resulted in fewer workers on factory floors.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions",

        "content": "When asked whether he would impose tariffs on cars imported from the European Union, President Donald Trump, as he regularly does, used an inflated figure for the trade balance between the U.S. and the EU. The deficit was $101 billion for 2017, not $151 billion, as he repeatedly claims.\nTrump, for years, has been using the goods-only figures for the U.S. trade deficit, instead of the goods-and-services deficit, to justify his trade policies. Since the United States exports a lot of services  such as travel, transportation, finance and intellectual property  Trump skews the trade picture by completely discounting the service trade. The U.S., in fact, has an overall trade surplus in services.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump wrongly claimed again and again that the U.S. trade deficit was nearly $800 billion, a generous rounding-up of the goods-only deficit of $758.9 billion in 2015, the latest figure at the time. The overall goods-and-services deficit was $531.5 billion then. He repeatedly claimed the deficit with China was $500 billion  close to the overall deficit with all countries. (The latest figure for China is $335.7 billion for 2017, despite Trumps assertion on Feb. 15 that a lot of people think its $506 billion.)\nSimilarly, he has distorted the trade figures for Canada and Mexico.\nTrump continues to falsely claim the U.S. has large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, when theres a trade surplus with Canada ($2.8 billion in 2017), and the deficit with Mexico ($68.7 billion) amounts to 11 percent of the total two-way trade with the U.S.\nThe president made his latest false claim about U.S. trade with the EU during an appearance with the federal chancellor of Austria. A reporter asked about a potential tariff Trump has proposed on automobiles and auto parts from the EU. In his response, Trump said:\nTrump, Feb. 20: Theyre very tough to make a deal with  the EU.  If we dont make the deal, well do the tariffs.  But the bottom-line result is whether or not we can make a deal with the EU thats fair. We lose about $151 billion trading with the EU. Thats a lot of money. And this has been going on for many years.\nThats a lot of money, but the wrong figure. Its 50 percent higher than the actual trade deficit with the EU.\nAnd the trade deficit has been going up under Trump. It was $101.2 billion with the EU in 2017, up nearly 10 percent from $92.1 billion in 2016, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published by the Census Bureau. In the last four quarters  from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the third quarter of 2018  the deficit was $113 billion.\nTrump consistently uses the goods-only figure, which also has risen, from $146.8 billion in 2016 to $151.4 billion in 2017 and $154.2 billion in 2018.\nAccording to the Washington Post Fact Checkers database of Trumps claims, the president has repeated his false claim about the EU trade deficit 131 times.\nTotal trade between the EU and U.S. was $1.1 trillion in 2016, and the EU is the largest goods trading partner for the U.S., according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\nEarly last summer, Trump threatened to put a 20 percent tariff on cars exported from the EU to the United States. At the time, the U.S. had added new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including those from the EU, and the EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products. On July 27, the EU and the United States agreed to hold trade negotiations and to not impose further tariffs in the meantime.\nIn an Aug. 21 rally in West Virginia, the president said: We are going to put a 25 percent tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States. And thatll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion dollars and give us a surplus of $151 billion.\nOn Feb. 17, the Commerce Department submitted a study to Trump on how automobile and auto parts imports affect national security. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the president can implement trade restrictions if the Commerce Department finds that imports harm national security. Such a finding was used by Trump to apply the steel and aluminum tariffs last year.",

When the service sector is excluded, the gap was even greater, rising to a record $891.3 billion.\nThe overall trade deficit has grown by $119 billion in the two years since Trump took office.\nLoading...\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\"We have almost an $800 billion a year trade deficit with other nations,\" Trump said in November 2017. \"Unacceptable. We are going to start whittling that down and as fast as possible.\"\nThe deficit, which is the difference between the goods and services the U.S. buys from other countries and those it sells to them, rose to a seasonally adjusted $59.8 billion in December  an increase of almost 19 percent.\nThe goods trade deficit with China rose to a record $419.2 billion, despite Trump's decision last year to impose tariffs on $50 billion in imports from the country.\nHe has also threatened to raise tariffs on another $200 billion if no progress is made in ongoing negotiations with Beijing.\nTrump also slapped tariffs, which are a kind of tax on imported goods, on steel and aluminum imports, a move that led to retaliation from some U.S. trading partners.\nThe trade gap is growing in large part because the U.S. economy has been strong compared to other major countries. That typically means Americans buy more from other nations.\nMost economists do not consider a trade deficit to be a marker of economic weakness. But Trump has consistently singled out the trade gap as a target in his America First policies. Ironically, the administration's tax cuts may have actually helped to increase the trade deficit by juicing spending on overseas goods by consumers and companies.\nAlso, the dollar strengthened against other currencies in the latter part of 2018, making foreign goods more affordable for Americans. The dollar's climb was partly due to a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.",

        "content": "Caked in filth, the world's most powerful drug baron hauled himself from a manhole.\nFor Joaqun \"El Chapo\" Guzmn, whose feats of escapology were matched only by his drug-smuggling acumen, it was a trademark yet ultimately futile manoeuvre. The 17 Mexican marines raiding his ranch nearby would catch him soon enough.\nSix months earlier, he had humiliated Mexican authorities by fleeing Mexico's most secure prison, his second jailbreak in two decades. This time he would not slip through their fingers, although those who caught him were left in no doubt how angry he was to have been arrested.\n\"You are all going to die,\" he warned police in the hours after his capture in Los Mochis, north-west Mexico, on 8 January 2016.\nThree years on, Guzmn has been handed a life sentence, plus 30 years, after being found guilty of international drug smuggling in a lurid three-month trial that exposed his criminal empire.\nAt his sentencing in New York, Guzmn said he had received an unfair trial and his treatment in solitary confinement was tantamount to torture.\n\"We're never going to see his like again,\" Douglas Century, the author of the book Hunting El Chapo, told the BBC.\nGuzmn was the oldest of seven children born into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico.\nHis parents - Emilio Guzmn Bustillos and Mara Consuelo Loera Prez - earned their living from farming. His father was officially a cattle rancher but is believed to have been an opium poppy farmer, Malcolm Beith writes in his book, The Last Narco.\nGuzmn's enterprising spirit was apparent from a young age. He would support his family by selling oranges to peasant farmers for a few pesos. His penchant for the spoils of wealth didn't go unnoticed, either. In a Vice News podcast, Guzmn's younger sister Bernarda said he would wear fake gold jewellery when visiting family members.\n\"Even as a little child, he had ambitions,\" his mother told filmmakers in 2014. She recalled he had \"a lot of paper money\" which he would count and recount.\nHis first foray into organised crime came at the age of 15, when he cultivated his own marijuana plantation with his cousins. Then, he adopted the nickname \"El Chapo\" - Mexican slang for \"Shorty\". But his ambitions belied his diminutive stature (he is only 5ft 6ins, or 1.64m).\nIn his late teens, Guzmn left La Tuna to seek his fortune in drug smuggling. \"He always fought for a better life,\" his mother said.\nGuzmn's reputation for ruthless efficiency was duly noted. In the 1980s he was introduced to Miguel ngel Flix Gallardo - known as the Godfather of the Guadalajara cartel - who put him in charge of handling logistics.\nWhen Flix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, his cartel's drug trafficking territories were divided among different factions, later known as The Federation. Guzmn was a beneficiary, setting up his own Sinaloa cartel with other traffickers in north-west Mexico.\nIn the 1990s, he honed his operation, pioneering the use of sophisticated underground tunnels to move drugs across the border.\n\"He was the go-to guy,\" David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, told the BBC. \"When the United States started shutting down ports of entry in the Atlantic and Pacific in the 1990s, drugs had to go through Mexico. And if it had to go through Mexico, it had to go through El Chapo.\"\nHe invested his proceeds wisely, not only expanding his enterprise, but building infrastructure that benefited locals in Sinaloa too. This cemented his popularity. \"You are Santa Claus. And everybody likes Santa Claus,\" Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico's former ambassador in Washington, told the New Yorker in 2014.\nOver time, Guzmn's cartel became one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US and in 2009, he entered Forbes' list of the world's richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (709m).\nAs his wealth and empire grew, so too did scrutiny from law enforcement. \"The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been after him for decades,\" Mr Weinstein said.\nIn 1993, a Roman Catholic cardinal was shot dead in a turf war with rival drug smugglers. Guzmn was among those blamed and a bounty was placed on his head by the Mexican government. His moustachioed face, previously unknown to the public, started appearing in newspapers and on TV screens. Within weeks, he was arrested in Guatemala and he was later sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, drug trafficking and bribery.\nA prison psychological profile described him as \"egocentric, narcissistic, shrewd, persistent, tenacious, meticulous, discriminating, and secretive\", according to the New Yorker. In prison, he enjoyed a life of luxury, smuggling in lovers, prostitutes and Viagra, according to reports in Mexico.\nEight years behind bars was enough for Guzmn. In January 2001, he broke out of a top-security jail, Puente Grande. He did so, as the myth goes, in a laundry cart. What's more likely, multiple journalists and authors argue, is that he simply walked out of the door with the help of corrupt guards.\nGuzmn controlled the prison to such an extent he escaped in police uniform, Mexican journalist Anabel Hernndez wrote in her book, Narcoland. Guzmn would spend the next decade evading authorities and consolidating his power as Mexico's pre-eminent drug smuggler. In that period, he always seemed to be one step ahead of would-be captors and rival cartels.\n\"He's a micro-manager,\" said Mr Century, who co-authored his book with Andrew Hogan, the undercover DEA agent who caught Guzmn in 2014. \"In the text messages we have, he's in the weeds of every single minor facet of his drug operation.\"\nSex was his other preoccupation, Mr Century said. \"He had more mistresses than you can probably fathom. This was his existence: having sex with strange women and micro-managing every detail of his operation.\"\nAfter 13 years on the run, Guzmn was captured by Mexican marines called in by Mr Hogan in February 2014. Guzmn's second prison break, in July 2015, was arguably even more fantastical than the first. This time, his accomplices used GPS to burrow a 1.5km (one mile) tunnel that led directly underneath his cell in Altiplano prison in central Mexico.\nThe escape was elaborate and carefully planned. The tunnel had ventilation, lighting and stairs and the exit was hidden by a construction site. Mexican TV stations later aired footage that showed that guards failed to act when loud hammering was heard from inside Guzmn's cell.\nGuzmn had embarrassed Mexico's government for the second time, leaving then-President Enrique Pea Nieto \"deeply troubled\" and \"outraged\".\nHis freedom, however, was short-lived. In January 2016, Guzmn was tracked down to a house in an affluent part of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Five of Guzmn's guards were killed in the raid by Mexican marines and he managed to flee out of a manhole, but was caught in a car while leaving town. One year later, he was extradited to the US.\nHis Achilles' heel, Mr Century told the BBC, was his narcissism. He was reaching out to actors and directors to commission screenplays about his life, Mr Century said. His communication with actors and producers gifted Mexico's attorney general a new line of investigation.\n\"When he escaped from prison in 2015, he probably could have run away to the mountains and just lived,\" Mr Century said. Instead, Guzmn made the unprecedented move of granting an exclusive interview to Hollywood actor Sean Penn in October 2015. It was a decision that may have cost him his freedom.\n\"I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats,\" he said in the interview published in Rolling Stone magazine. After his capture it was speculated - though never formally confirmed - that Mexican authorities found Guzmn by tracking Penn. \"He contacted actresses and producers, which was part of one line of investigation,\" said Mexico's attorney general, Arely Gmez.\nHis beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, she said, \"looked bored most of the time\" - even when Guzmn's former mistress testified. While Coronel remained placid, the trial's astonishing moments shocked others.\nOne witness, for example, told the court Guzmn buried a man alive. Another told of a rival narco chief who refused to shake Guzmn's hand - and paid for it with his life. Court papers also accused him of drugging and raping girls as young as 13, calling them his \"vitamins\".\nThe scale of his drug trafficking operation was laid bare, too.\nAssistant US Attorney Adam Fels alleged that Guzmn had sent the equivalent of more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the US in just four shipments. And to protect his businesses, a bribe of $100m (77m) was paid to former President Pea Nieto when he took office in 2012, it was alleged in court. Mr Pea Nieto strenuously denies the allegation.\nWhen Guzmn's guilty verdict was read aloud, his mouth was \"agape\" and he looked \"vaguely stunned\", the New York Times reported.\nIn a trial that attracted podcasters, screenwriters and true-crime obsessives, some observers said the media attention trivialised the proceedings. The intention was quite the contrary, our correspondent said. The trial was meant to be a public spectacle to show what El Chapo and his henchmen had done and to send a warning to others, she said.\nThe title of Mr Beith's book, The Last Narco, suggests Guzmn is one of a dying breed of ultra-violent drug barons as bloodthirsty as they are shrewd.\nYet, while Guzmn is likely to die behind bars, Mexico's drug-smuggling problem is likely to outlive him. In his Rolling Stone interview, Guzmn said it was false to assume drug trafficking would cease \"the day I don't exist\".\nFor all his supposed vanity and self-confidence, not even Guzmn can claim to be the last narco.",

        "content": "Claim:\nOn Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration's desire to be on good terms with the European Union.\nApproximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.\nOne conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform's captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said.\nTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation  whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason  we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden's speech.\nConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:\n\"Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.\"\nWhile saying \"I'm eager to hear,\" Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant \"mmmm\" in the word \"I'm\" blended with the next word, \"eager,\" to make a \"mnnm-eager\" sound. That was the source of the social media posts' allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker's reason for saying it.\nA more plausible reason for the president's phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.\nOn several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound), according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.\nIn other words, the claim is false  Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.",

Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.\nIn February 2021, a few weeks after Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, a few social media users appeared to be in denial of reality as they held on to the idea that former President Donald Trump was somehow still the commander in chief. When a photo of Biden in the Oval Office started circulating online, they claimed that the photo was not taken at the White House but actually showed a movie set:\nThis photograph was taken on Feb. 5, 2021, as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a meeting in the actual Oval Office to discuss their COVID-19 relief package. ABC News reported:\nIn an Oval Office meeting with House Democrats on Friday, Biden recounted how as vice president, then-President Barack Obama had tasked him with pushing through legislation on Capitol Hill to address the recession.\n\"It was hard as hell to get the votes for it to begin with, and then it was hard as hell to get even the number we got,\" Biden said at the start of the gathering. \"But one thing we learned is, you know, we can't do too much here; we can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.\"\nThe claim that this photograph was taken on a movie set is based entirely on what appears, at first glance, to be a crack in the wall behind Biden. This crack, however, simply shows a partially opened door.\nThe Oval Office has four doors, two of which were designed to blend in with the walls. Here's a photograph of Trump that shows the same \"crack\" that can be seen in the viral image of Biden. In the Trump photo, it's clear that this \"crack\" is just a door:\nWhile these \"hidden\" doors may conjure up thoughts of secret passages or escape pathways, there isn't anything secret about these doors. They are just normal doors that open up to rooms adjacent to the Oval Office. The decision to blend them into the walls appears to have been a purely aesthetic choice.\nHere's another video from the Oval Office that showcases these doors. In 2010, former President Barack Obama met with some students featured in the documentary \"Waiting for Superman.\" At one point, one of the kids asks Obama about these strange looking doors:",

It's also true that the United States has a population of approximately 327 million people. However, if you doled out $500 million equally among 327 million people, they would not each receive $1 million. In reality, Bloomberg spent enough to give each American about $1.50.\nSo Williams and Gay were off by about $1 million per person.\nAt the time of this writing, neither Williams nor MSNBC had corrected the mistake.

On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall? Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isnt playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials emphatic insistence that theyll never cough up the dough.\nBecause nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that, the billionaire businessman added. We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. Thats how I know theyre bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, Im going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when Im done building it, Im going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteens Born In The USA to them, just for the hell of it. You just dont mess with the U.S., and thats that ... Let me tell you, weve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think thats a pretty definitive message, and thats the hard way. Now, Ive said before that political correctness is whats killing this country, and Im standing by it. However, since Ive never been a warmonger, Im trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, well have no problem. If they dont and they start acting up, well, well just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.\nComments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from an MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:\nOn MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\nTrust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn't playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday.\nOne of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials' emphatic insistence that they'll never cough up the dough.\nMexican President Pea Nieto blasted Trump in two separate interviews this week, slamming the billionaire's strident expressions to a Mexico City newspaper and warning that the kind of rhetoric he uses has led to very fateful scenes in the history of humanity.\nThat's the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived, Pea Nieto said. Trump's comments, he told El Universal, have \"hurt the relationship we have sought with the United States.\"\nThe first portion of the article may have led readers to think that the subsequent claims were real, but everything beyond its first paragraph was fabricated. Content published by the self-styled \"hybrid\" news sites Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo built upon controversial current events with related embellishments. Politicalo and related sites featured a button enabling readers to \"Show Facts\" or \"Hide Facts\":\nHowever, every Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo item opened in \"Hide Facts\" mode by default, making the embellishments difficult for readers to identify. In addition to its \"Show Facts/Hide Facts\" feature, Politicalo's disclaimer explained:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nPrevious Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo articles that caused social media confusion included claims that Marco Rubio said women should be taken into custody if they were considering an abortion (and that Zika was a punishment from God), Pat Robertson said gay people should wear colors by which heterosexual people could identify them in public, Pastor John Piper said bikini waxes were a sin in the eyes of God, David Bowie was alive but held hostage by Satanic entities, Ted Cruz said God would not have allowed Antonin Scalia to die at a time that was not politically expedient, a Republican lawmaker proposed saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for food stamp recipients, and Bristol Palin said that more black actors weren't nominated for Oscars because they all looked alike.",

        "content": "Claim:\nOprah Winfrey wore a GPS ankle monitor during her interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.\nOrigin\nFollowers of the QAnon conspiracy cult frequently claim to see GPS-monitoring ankle bracelets on high-profile political figures and celebrities, and Oprah Winfrey is no exception. During Winfrey's bombshell interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, on March 7, 2021, some took to social media to report they believed they saw evidence that Winfrey was wearing one. Here's an example of one such post, with the user's name cropped out for privacy:\nAs we have previously reported, QAnon followers generally believe that various Democratic legislators and A-list celebrities are part of a satanic, cannibalistic pedophile ring:\nIn general, QAnon believes [former U.S. President Donald] Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a deep state, satanic cabal of baby-eating, child sex-traffickers led by prominent members of the Democratic party, entertainers who espouse liberal opinions, anybody who mentions pizza, and authoritative sources who relay credible information that may cast a negative light on the president. Proponents of this theory believe that one day soon the storm will come and Trump, with the help of an anonymous high-ranking military official known as Q, will round up members of the deep state, arrest them, and possibly have them executed.\nThe latter part of the above paragraph explains why QAnon followers believe so many famous people wear ankle monitors. The belief system prompts them to look for signs that those famous people are on the brink of mass arrest, as they wait, and wait, for the so-called \"storm\" of arrests and prosecutions to come.\nBut Winfrey wasn't wearing an ankle monitor, nor is she being GPS-tracked by a fictional \"Q\" character and a former president. She was wearing long, brown leather boots, and the bump that people saw was simply a crease in the material when she sat with her legs crossed.",

It was set up by demonstrators amid protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose in-custody death while pinned under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020 went viral after being captured on video.\nDuring the resulting weeks of sustained protests against racism and police brutality, Seattle activists set up the police-free zone, which has become a target for criticism by President Donald Trump and his supporters. But disparaging comments linking the performer to the CHOP are misleading, as the image has nothing to do with the protests.\nHere is the version of the photograph that is being shared, along with commentary such as, \"Antifa Seattle today  this is the group that the Democrats want to rule America  no further comment necessary?!\"\nBut the picture wasn't taken in Seattle, and it wasn't taken during the protests that swept the nation in the spring of 2020 in the wake of Floyd's killing.\nThe original photograph was taken by photographer Peretz Partensky on Sept. 25, 2011, at the Folsom Street Fair, which is a leather and BDSM festival that takes place every fall in San Francisco, California. And the singer in the black netting is a member of the Italian disco band Hard Ton, which is based in Venice, Italy, according to its Facebook profile. The antifa flag in the upper left corner was edited into the picture after the fact.\nWe contacted Hard Ton for comment about the picture being misappropriated, but did not hear back in time for publication.\nBecause the original photograph was taken long before the CHOP was set up in Seattle, and the events took place in a different location altogether, we rate this claim \"Miscaptioned.\"",

These dangerous foreign walk-overs who look more and more like real every-day normal Americans, lured with gift baskets and teddy bears, often blend into the very footholds of our societal norms after establishing dangerous toeholds.\nPalin, known as a vocal and athletic supporter of Donald Trump, said that she is now a double-barreled, locked and loaded supporter of both Trumps and Ted Cruzs proposed guidelines for stricter immigration laws, border protections and neighborhood scrutinies.\n-An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Mrs. Palins call for the removal of Aerobics from physical education courses. The author regrets the error.\nThere is no truth to this story, which came from a well-known (and prolific) hoax and satire news site. The joke in this case is that \"Arabic numerals\" (also known as Hindu-Arabic numerals) are the numbers most familiar to much of the world, and originated in India during the 6th or 7th century. They were introduced to Europe by mathematicians from what is now the Middle East (shown here as they appeared in the Codex Vigilianus around the 10th century):\nPalin has thrown her political backing behind Trump, and has been active on traditional and social media expressing that support. However, she has made no mention of banning numbers, whether of Hindu-Arabic or Roman origin.",

        "content": "Este artculo estar disponible en espaol en El Tiempo Latino.\nQuick Take\nVice President Kamala Harris had a romantic relationship with powerful California politician Willie Brown in the 1990s. But claims on social media that she broke up his marriage misrepresent the facts. Brown had separated from his wife years before he and Harris had dated.\nFull Story\nFalse and misleading claims targeting Vice President Kamala Harris intensified as she drew closer to formally becoming the Democratic nominee for president on Aug. 5.\nWeve written about the false narrative that Harris only recently began identifying as Black.\nAnother viral claim circulating on social media rehashes old rumors about Harris relationship with the influential California Democrat Willie Brown in the 1990s while Harris was working as an assistant district attorney. These posts misleadingly claimed that Harris started her career by sleeping with a married man or that she stole a black womans husband.\nHere is what we know about Harris relationship with Brown.\nHarris was 29 in March 1994 when a San Francisco Chronicle columnist described her as Browns new steady, going on to say that she was something new in Willies love life. Shes a woman, not a girl. At the time, Brown, who was then 60 years old and speaker of the California State Assembly, had been estranged from his wife for more than a decade.\nAs speaker, Brown appointed Harris to the California Medical Assistance Commission later that year, which provides the basis for claims that Brown helped Harris career that sometimes accompany the claims suggesting that she broke up his marriage. (Brown left the Assembly in 1995, and became mayor of San Francisco until 2004.)\nBrown had married Blanche Vitero in 1957 and the couple had three children. But by the early 1970s, Brown was frequently seen around town with young women and his marriage collapsed, according to a 1996 biography written by James Richardson, a senior writer at the Sacramento Bee. It was at this time that Brown got the first of a series of apartments of his own, while his relationship with his wife settled into a mutually beneficial friendship, Richardson wrote.\nA 1984 profile published in the New York Times described Brown as an escort for attractive women and good friend of his former wife, from whom it says he separated amicably two years earlier.\nI dont know whether the marriage failed and the relationship survived or vice versa, but something very valuable lasted, Brown wrote in his own 2008 autobiography, explaining that he and his wife had celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2007, although they hadnt lived together in 25 years.\nAlthough Blanche and I led very different lives, there was never a breakup, he wrote. The two of us kept the family circle going. Weve always been in each others lives. Were friends.\nIndeed, as we said, Brown had developed a reputation for dating around and, in 2001, he welcomed a fourth child, a daughter, with his then-girlfriend Carolyn Carpeneti.\nHarris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship by the end of 1995 or the beginning of 1996. But it has come up repeatedly since Harris first sought public office as San Francisco district attorney, which she won in 2003. During that campaign, Harris was trying to distance herself from Brown, telling SF Weekly, His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing. She called him an albatross hanging around my neck.\nBut, 20 years later, claims about that relationship continue to shadow Harris as she seeks higher office.\nClarification, Aug. 8: We updated this story to better reflect the time frame for when Harris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nVice presidential nominee Kamala Harris had an extramarital affair with former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who gave her two political appointments that launched her political career.\nRating:\nMixture\nAbout this rating\nWhat's True\nHarris did date former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown for a period of time between 1994 to 1995. In his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed her to two political posts  first to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and then to the Medical Assistance Commission.\nWhat's False\nAlthough Brown was technically still married during the time period that he dated Harris, he had been estranged from his wife Blanche Brown for more than a decade. Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened well after the relationship ended, and Harris sought to distance herself from Brown.\nOn Aug. 11, 2020, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, selected U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate. Harris, who is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, made history as the first woman of color nominated as vice president on a major party ticket.\nPredictably, the internet lit up with rumors about Harris, who has been married to her husband, attorney Douglas Emhoff, since 2014. Snopes readers asked about articles and memes circulating on social media stating that years prior, Harris had an \"extramarital\" affair with former San Francisco Mayor and California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, with some claiming that Harris' political success was achieved by being Brown's so-called mistress.\nA tawdry headline from Teaparty.org story read, \"Flashback: Kamala Harris Launched Her Political Career In Bedroom As Mistress Of Married Mayor Willie Brown.\"\nHere's an example of a meme circulating on Facebook, which appears to have been generated during Harris' run in the presidential primaries:\nThese narratives are misleading by way of exaggeration. Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, but Brown had been estranged from his wife since 1981. Brown did appoint Harris to two political posts in 1994 while he served as Speaker of the California Assembly, but that was years before Harris won her first election in 2003. She was already working as an assistant district attorney in Alameda County when she took on the appointments.\nIt's never been a secret Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, although it may not be well known outside political circles in California. Brown addressed their past relationship in a terse piece published by the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 26, 2019, a day before Harris officially launched her presidential campaign:\nYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker.\nAnd I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.\nThe history of the relationship and political appointments Brown gave Harris have also been reported in California-based news outlets for years. Los Angeles Magazine reported in 2019:\nWillie Brown was a fixture in California politics for years, serving as speaker of the state assembly for 15 years, and known as something of an unofficial deal-maker and influencer. He first met Harris in 1994, when she was an assistant district attorney in Alameda County. He was 60 years old at the time, and had been estranged from his wife, Blanche Brown, since 1981.\nIn his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed Harris to two political positions. The first was a six-month appointment to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board; the second was a role on the Medical Assistance Commission, a body tasked with negotiating contracts to control Medi-Cal costs. At the time, Brown had a reputation for filling many openings with his personal associates and inner circle; when Harris vacated the Appeals Board gig, he replaced her with his longtime buddy Philip S. Ryan.\nHarris ended the relationshipwhich was conducted in the open and frequently reported on at the timein late 1995, shortly before Brown was sworn in for his first of two terms as mayor of San Francisco.\nHarris didn't run for political office until well after her relationship with Brown ended. In 2003, she made a successful bid for the office of San Francisco district attorney, a position she held until she was elected to serve as the attorney general of California, taking office in 2011. She held that post until she was elected in 2016 to serve in the United States Senate representing the state of California.\nHarris has been beset by allegations that Brown influenced her career for years. At the time of her first run for office for San Francisco district attorney, SF Weekly quoted Harris distancing herself from Brown:\nI refuse to design my campaign around criticizing Willie Brown for the sake of appearing to be independent when I have no doubt that I am independent of him  and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\nHis career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\nIn regards to the political appointments, Harris went on to state:\nThese jobs were created before I was born. Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work. I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital [in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood] open. I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs. I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no\nIt's true that Harris dated Brown between 1994 and 1995. During that time, when he was serving as speaker of the California assembly, Brown gave Harris two political appointments. Although it's true that Brown was married at that time, the relationship was no secret, since Brown had long been separated from his wife. All of Harris' electoral victories occurred years after her relationship with Brown ended. We rate this claim \"Mixture,\" because while there are elements of objective fact  Brown and Harris dated, Brown appointed Harris to two posts  other elements are sensationalized and misleading.",

Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened eight years after the relationship ended. Since then, Harris and Brown have taken several opportunities to distance themselves from each other.\nAfter U.S. President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, ended his 2024 campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in July 2024, old rumors that she had \"slept her way to the top\" returned:\nThe claim spread quickly on X, Facebook and TikTok.\nSeveral people, including former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, insisted that Harris' affair to former San Francisco Mayor and Speaker of the California Assembly Willie Brown was relevant to her White House bid as proof of her \"ruthlessness\" and \"ambition.\" Indeed, they said, Brown gave her visibility by appointing her to two political posts in the mid-1990s, when they were reportedly \"dating.\"\nThe claim first appeared in 2020, after Biden nominated Harris as his running mate.

He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

One version of this hoax, for instance, was dressed up as an official announcement from Tesla.\nBut this is not a genuine statement from Tesla.\nMusk, the CEO of companies such as Tesla and SpaceX, is one of the richest people in the world.

        "date": "2019-11-18T07:51:19",
        "content": "Claim:\nA San Francisco mural portrait of Greta Thunberg used 700 gallons of spray paint.\nIn November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about widely shared social media posts claiming irony or hypocrisy at work in the production of a massive San Francisco mural in honor of the young climate activist Greta Thunberg.\nOn Nov. 8, the right-leaning social media activist Brandon Straka tweeted a link to a KPIX-TV article about the mural, adding his own view that, \"The leftist geniuses in San Francisco have decided to send a message about climate change by creating a 6 story [sic] mural of Greta Thunberg using 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\"\nThe text of Straka's tweet, and screenshots of it, were further promulgated by multiple users on Facebook. The KPIX-TV article to which he linked did not contain any reference to the paint used by Argentinian artist Andrs Pereoselli (known as \"Cobre\") in creating the Thunberg mural. As such, it did not provide any evidence to support Straka's key claim, that the portrait of the climate activist required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\nIt's not clear where that figure came from, but it might have originated in an article on the right-leaning website The Blaze, which wrote:\n\"While it is unclear how many spray cans [Cobre] has used, the mural spans four stories and at least one smaller project utilized 500 cans of the paint scientists say can generate asthma-inducing smog.\"\nThe Daily Wire, another right-leaning website, subsequently extrapolated that \"the Thunberg mural will likely take closer to 700 cans to finish.\"\nAnalysis\nIn response to concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint, One Atmosphere, a California environmental non-profit group that collaborated with Cobre on the mural, posted the following explanation to Instagram on Nov. 11:\nSome folks have been asking about the environmental impacts of the Greta mural. Read on for some details. The vast majority of the paint is water-based acrylic exterior paint that was rolled onto the building by hand. The finishing details can only be done with spray paint, but we are using spray cans without CFCs. (CFCs are tremendously damaging to the environment). We are using low pressure cans with a minimal footprint. The cans and the boxes will also be recycled, although many of the cans will first have a second life as part of a separate art project.\nThe cans have been picked up and delivered in an electric vehicle, and the artist and organizers have been travelling almost exclusively by way of electric car, electric scooter or on foot to the project site. The lift being used is also electric, not diesel. We are doing our best to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in that order!\nAfter the completion of the project, One Atmosphere's Executive Director Paul Scott provided further details to Snopes in an email. He firmly rejected the claim that the project required 700 gallons, or even 700 cans, of spray paint.\nIn reality, Scott said he counted a total of 117 used 400-ml cans of spray paint, almost all of them from the MTN 94 brand. That's just over 12 gallons in total. However, only some of that 400-ml capacity is taken up by the hydrocarbon propellant that escapes into the atmosphere (as opposed to the liquid paint, which ends up on the side of the building).\nAll aerosol spray paints use a propellant to help disperse the paint from the can and onto its intended surface. In the past, manufacturers used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals that were widely banned from the late 1980s onwards due to the fact that they deplete the ozone layers in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.\nIn the United States in 2019, spray paint manufacturers use hydrocarbons such as propane and butane as propellants. Unlike CFCs, hydrocarbons don't have a deleterious effect on ozone, but they do have a small effect on global warming. However, it's worth putting the scale of that effect into some context, using a measure known as Global Warming Potential.\nAs the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains on its website:\n\"The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period.\"\nThe CFCs used as propellants in aerosol paint in the past have a GWP of between 5,000 and 14,000. Propane, a hydrocarbon commonly used now as a propellant in spray paint, has a GWP of 4. In his email to Snopes, Scott added that, \"The amount of the propellant is also less because the cans are lower pressure, and obviously only a portion of each can is propellant, so the ultimate GWP impact of the cans we used is very limited.\"",

One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

        "title": "US officials: Pilot error caused Kobe Bryant chopper crash",
        "date": "2021-02-09T23:20:51",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP)  The pilot who crashed the helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant, killing all nine aboard, made a series of poor decisions that led him to fly blindly into a wall of clouds where he became so disoriented he thought he was climbing when the craft was plunging toward a Southern California hillside, federal safety officials said Tuesday.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board primarily blamed pilot Ara Zobayan in the Jan. 26, 2020 crash that killed him along with Bryant, the basketball stars daughter and six other passengers heading to a girls basketball tournament.\nZobayan, an experienced pilot, ignored his training, violated flight rules by flying into conditions where he couldnt see and failed to take alternate measures, such as slowing down and landing or switching to auto-pilot, that would have averted the tragedy.\nThe NTSB said it was likely Zobayan felt pressure to deliver his star client to his daughters game at Bryants Mamba Sports Academy. Officials believe Zobayan may have also felt continuation bias, an unconscious tendency among pilots to stick with the original plan despite changing conditions.\nThe closer you get to the destination the more you think just maybe you can pull this off, NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said Tuesday.\nThe agency announced the long-awaited findings during a four-hour hearing pinpointing probable causes of what went awry in the 40-minute flight. The crash led to widespread public mourning for the retired basketball star and several lawsuits, and prompted state and federal legislation.\nThe agency also faulted Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, for inadequate review and oversight of safety matters.\nWhen Zobayan decided to climb above the clouds, he entered a trap that has doomed many flights. Once a pilot loses visual cues by flying into fog or darkness, the inner ear can send erroneous signals to the brain that causes spatial disorientation. Its sometimes known as the leans, causing pilots to believe they are flying aircraft straight and level when they are banking.\nZobayan radioed air traffic controllers that he was climbing when, in fact, he was banking and descending rapidly toward the steep hills near Calabasas, NTSB investigators concluded.\nFlying under visual flight rules, Zobayan was required to be able to see where he was going. Flying into the cloud was a violation of that standard and probably led to his disorientation, NTSB said.\nThere were 184 aircraft crashes between 2010-2019 involving spatial disorientation, including 20 fatal helicopter crashes, the NTSB said.\nWhat part of cloud, when youre on a visual flight rules program, do pilots not understand? Landsberg said.\nNTSB member Michael Graham said Zobayan ignored his training and added that that as long as helicopter pilots continue flying into clouds without relying on instruments, which requires a high level of training, a certain percentage arent going to come out alive.\nZobayan had been certified to fly using only instruments, but was no longer proficient, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.\nThe Sikorsky S-76B helicopter was flying at about 184 mph (296 kph) and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) per minute when it slammed into the hillside and ignited, scattering debris over an area the size of a football field. The victims died immediately.\nBryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and six others who left Orange County that morning were headed to his Mamba Sports Academy in Ventura County. The group had flown to the same destination the previous day and Zobayan had flown Bryant along that route at least 10 times in 2019.\nThe aircraft itself had been flown on largely direct routes between the airports in Orange and Ventura counties about two dozen times since late 2018, data shows, but the pilot took the chopper further north because of low visibility that day.\nThere was no sign of mechanical failure and the pilot was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, investigators said.\nThe helicopter did not have so-called black box recording devices, which were not required, that would have given investigators a better understanding of what happened.\nThe NTSB report reiterated a previous recommendation to require flight data and cockpit voice recorders on choppers, but the agency only investigates transportation-related crashes. It has no enforcement powers and must submit suggestions to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration or the Coast Guard, which have repeatedly rejected some board safety recommendations after other transportation disasters.\nOver the past year, experts speculated that the crash could lead to a recommendation for requiring helicopters to have Terrain Awareness and Warning System devices, which signal when aircraft are in danger of crashing.\nBut NTSB investigator-in-charge Bill English said the system, which was not on the helicopter, would probably not have prevented the crash.\nThe hilly terrain, combined with the disorientation, would have made the warning system a confusing factor, English said.\nThe pilot doesnt know which way is up, English said.\nFederal lawmakers have sponsored the Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant Helicopter Safety Act to mandate the warning systems on all helicopters carrying six or more passengers.\nThe NTSB report is likely to factor into litigation in the case, whether its admissible in court or not, said Dallas lawyer Michael Lyons.\nThe crash generated lawsuits and countersuits, with Bryants widow suing Island Express and the pilot for wrongful death on the day a massive public memorial was held almost a year ago at Staples Center, where the Lakers all-star played most his career.\nVanessa Bryant said Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, and its owner, Island Express Holding Corp., did not properly train or supervise Zobayan. She said the pilot was careless and negligent to fly in fog and should have aborted the flight.\nZobayans brother, Berge Zobayan, has said Kobe Bryant knew the risks of flying in a helicopter and that his survivors arent entitled to damages from the pilots estate. Island Express Helicopters Inc. denied responsibility and said the crash was an act of God that it could not control.\nLawyers for Berge Zobayan and Island Express said they had no comment on the NTSB findings.\nFamilies of other victims sued the helicopter companies but not the pilot.\nThe others killed in the crash were Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughters basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton. Alyssa and Payton were Giannas teammates.\nThe companies have countersued two FAA air traffic controllers, saying the crash was caused by their series of erroneous acts and/or omissions.\nWhile air traffic controllers failed to report the loss of radar contact and radar communication with the flight, which was inconsistent with their procedures, it did not contribute to the crash, the NTSB said.",

        "content": "Claim:\nChinese officials are seeking approval to start the mass killing of 20,000 people in order to stop the spread of new coronavirus.\nOn Feb. 5, 2020, the website AB-TC (aka City News) published an article that claimed Chinese officials were seeking approval from the Supreme Peoples Court to start the mass killing of 20,000 people infected with the new coronavirus in an attempt to contain the disease:\nChina seek for courts approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus\nThe highest level of court in Chhina [sic], Supreme Peoples Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.\nThe State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.\nThis is not a genuine news report. While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet's reporting.\nFor starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \"BREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\" But Shurmur didn't die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.\nThe website has also published hoax articles about \"cannibal restaurants\" (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\nThis website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:\nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News' website\nOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called City News published an article titled BREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\nAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\nNone of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person's byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called \"local correspondents.\"\nIn other words, this website doesn't exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting.\nIn addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC's article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \"document\" or a \"press conference,\" they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \"the state\" or \"the court\" or an \"official\" made a statement, but doesn't provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\nLastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China \"ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.\" That report, of course, made no mention of \"mass killings.\"\nThere is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China website.\nAB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we've concluded that this report is indeed false.",

At 81, he's the oldest president in U.S. history.\nBut some things apparently never get old, notably the strange tradition of presidential turkey pardons, which is happening again Monday as well.\n\"This is the 76th anniversary of this event, and I want you to know, I wasn't there for the first one,\" Biden said with a chuckle right before he spared \"Liberty\" and \"Bell,\" this year's turkeys from a flock in Minnesota.\nThe tradition of giving presidents turkeys to eat did, in fact, start in 1947, but of pardoning them, that's a more complicated tale.\nThis has come to be a tradition that ironically features an American president sanctioning an event sponsored by a lobbying group, which advocates the opposite of what actually takes place at said event.\nThe president makes a few jokes and lets a turkey go free in what only became a formalized occurrence at the White House in the 1980s. But the turkey lobby's actual goal, as most likely know, is to get people to eat more turkey.\nA long, strange history\nThis dance between the turkey lobby and presidents started in the 1940s, but back then, it was  a more honest  gifting of a bird for the president and his family to eat at Thanksgiving.\nBut death is a hard sell.\nMost Americans probably don't know or think about how their food gets to their tables. They really care, as surveys have found, about how it tastes and how cheap it is.\nPoliticians know this.\nRealizing the awkwardness of the whole situation  of publicly accepting a live turkey that was destined for his dinner table  John F. Kennedy broke the tradition in 1963.\n\"I think we'll just let this one grow,\" Kennedy said of the gobbling fowl with a sign around its neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"\nHe and succeeding presidents would realize, it's better to be seen as a turkey liberator rather than the one to publicly send ol' Giblet to the executioner.\nThere was a close call, though, during the George W. Bush administration when Barney, the president's plucky Scottish Terrier, almost silenced the gobble of that year's bird.\nIt took Bush hustling out of a national security meeting to call him off. And remember, this is the same dog that bit a reporter.\nGood thing Biden's German Shepherds were kept far away from the event or there might have been a real ... fowl up.\nAn expanding tradition ... for some reason\nThe birds get their royal treatment, their own hotel room and, of course, punny jokes. And despite the irony, pointed out by your author year after year, this event shows no signs of slowing down.\nIn fact, it only seems to be expanding.\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer brought the tradition to Michigan in 2022, pardoning \"Mitch E. Gander\" (get it!?). And it's slated to happen again this year.\nAlabama has apparently been doing this for decades. Oddly, the birds also, according to the Alabama Daily News, used to use the same names for the turkey every year for some reason  \"Clyde\" and \"Henrietta.\"\nThat changed this year after an online poll of Alabamians picked Giblet and Puddin'.\n\"Today, by the powers vested in me as governor of the state of Alabama,\" Gov. Kay Ivey said at this year's event, \"I hereby am granting a full pardon to Giblet and Puddin', so that they can spend their turkey day enjoying a meal of their own.\"\nLet's just hope that meal isn't what everyone else eats for Thanksgiving.\nIt's become so embedded in the culture that a town in East Texas this year decided to join in on the strange tradition and let live a turkey by the name of ... Dolly Pardon.\n\"The turkey is named Dolly because she's a strong female role model,\" Lisa Mays-Gonzalez, Van Community Library director. \"And it's a tribute to our Southern roots. And she is a very strong literacy advocate.\"\nNo word on whether the turkey can read.\nDolly is set to live out her days at the \"Believe in Vegan\" ranch.",

Individual farms had been gifting presidents birds since the 19th century.\nHis government launched a campaign in 1947 to encourage people to forego eating poultry and eggs on Thursdays, in order to conserve supplies to send to post-war Europe. But Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day fell on Thursdays that year causing outrage.\nPoultry growers sent crates of live chickens to the White House as part of a \"Hens for Harry\" protest campaign.\nOther presidents before Mr Bush Snr did spare birds lives, including President John F Kennedy - who gave an unofficial pardoning days before his assassination in 1963. The light-hearted event with media presence would set the tone for today's presentations.\nPresidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan were also reported to have spared some gifted turkey's lives by sending them to live on farms.\nUnder President Barack Obama, the event became an opportunity for his daughters to make rare public appearances. There has been speculation as to whether 11-year-old Barron Trump will appear at Tuesday's event.\nMr Obama became known for his \"dad jokes\" at the pardonings, in 2016 invoking questionable turkey puns like \"Yes we cran!\".\nThis year's birds, Wishbone and Drumstick, are currently staying at the Willard Intercontinental hotel, where all White House birds have stayed since 2004.\nVideos of them messing up their beds with sawdust were posted by the White House social media team.\nTheir luxury hotel stay is financed by the National Turkey Association, which continues to donate birds each year. This year's birds were raised in Alexandria, Minnesota, by the group's chairman.\nTurkey is the favourite US food for the Thanksgiving holiday, with an estimated 46 million consumed on the day annually.\nTop-Trump turkey stats\nThe Trump administration released statistic cards for both birds online alongside a poll to see which the public thought should be officially pardoned.\nThe poll spurned some users on social media to make jokes about whether he should use his pardoning on members of his administration, because of the ongoing Russian collusion investigation.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

        "content": "A lame-duck president \"pardoned\" a turkey Monday.\n\"They tell me there's 2,500 people here today looking for a pardon,\" President Biden joked at a White House ceremony on the South Lawn. After one of the turkeys, Peach, let out a few gobbles, Biden said, \"What did you say, Peach? Peach is making a last-minute plea here.\"\nHe implored the turkeys to \"keep calm and gobble on,\" then pardoned them. \"Based on your temperament and your commitment to being productive members of society,\" the president said, \"I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom.\"\nBiden noted that the birds would live out their days at the Farmamerica Agricultural Interpretive Center in Minnesota, the top-producing turkey state.\nHe hinted to this strange event's history and did so accurately, unlike many past presidents.\nNot to be snood-y about it, but this fowl tradition has a long and oft-confused history. So let's dispel the myths that get stuck in our beaks that too many have clawed onto and get to the truth of the matter.\nEven presidents have gotten it wrong\nWhich president was the first to pardon a turkey? This might be a shaggy turkey story, but bear with us.\nTo paraphrase a former president, this depends on what the definition of \"pardon\" is.\n\"This is a tradition that dates back to the presidency of Harry Truman,\" then-President George W. Bush said in 2008.\nEh. Sort of, but not when it comes to pardoning turkeys.\n\"So continuing a tradition begun 50 years ago by President Truman, I am going to keep at least -- excuse me -- one turkey off of the Thanksgiving dinner table by giving a pardon to a turkey from Ohio,\" said former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\nThat's definitely not true. And he repeated it the next year.\n\"President Truman was the first president to pardon a turkey,\" he said.\nStill not true. It got so bad that the Truman Library had to weigh in.\n\"The Library's staff has found no documents, speeches, newspaper clippings, photographs, or other contemporary records in our holdings which refer to Truman pardoning a turkey that he received as a gift in 1947, or at any other time during his Presidency,\" it said in a statement in 2003. \"Truman sometimes indicated to reporters that the turkeys he received were destined for the family dinner table.\"\nTruman was the first to be given a turkey by the National Turkey Federation, but not the first to pardon one\nThis is where the confusion comes in. The turkey lobby has been presenting presidents with turkeys since 1947, when Truman was president.\nBut, as the Truman Library notes, the post-Depression, post-World War II-era president ate his turkeys.\nAnd that was the original intent  a gift for the presidential holiday table and for Big Turkey to get attention and remind people to eat turkey for Thanksgiving, of course.\nThere's a story that suggests Abraham Lincoln was the first to let a turkey go because his son took a liking to it, but the White House Historical Association says that story is \"likely apocryphal.\"\nSo maybe it was Lincoln, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was Kennedy?\nThe first documented reprieve of a turkey during a turkey presentation from the Turkey Federation was in 1963.\nA sign hung around a turkey's neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"\nSo clearly the intent was for the president to eat it. But Kennedy, for whatever reason, said, \"We'll just let this one grow.\"\nThe L.A. Times headlined that 1963 event as a \"presidential pardon.\"\nBut it certainly wasn't official.\nWhen was the word \"pardon\" first used by a president in relation to a turkey?\nFollowing Kennedy, Nixon and Carter sent their turkeys to petting zoos. But the word \"pardon\" wasn't used until Reagan in 1987, when he presented that year's White House turkey, \"Charlie.\"\nIt was during the Iran-Contra crisis, and ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson yelled a question about whether Reagan would pardon Oliver North and John Poindexter, who were involved in the arms swap. Reagan deflected, saying, \"If they'd given me a different answer on Charlie and his future, I would have pardoned him.\"\nThe turkey pardon became an officially sanctioned White House event by George H.W. Bush\nThe elder former President Bush, Reagan's vice president, formalized the event in 1989.\n\"[L]et me assure you and this fine tom turkey,\" he said, \"that he will not end up on anyone's dinner table, not this guy  he's presented a presidential pardon as of right nowand allow him to live out his days on a children's farm not far from here.\"",

While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors.

I give you George Soros. A SS in the National Socialist German workers party. Nazi party. He served under Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler. He said it was the best time of his life. The destruction and agony around him was euphoric to him. This man was making policy with Hillary Clinton. And some of you think Trump is dangerous. Wow!\nWow, indeed. But given his age, Soros couldn't have joined the SS (whose minimum age requirement was 17) even if he had wanted to. Moreover, as a Hungarian Jew he couldn't have met the SS requirement for pure \"Aryan\" heritage. Quite to the contrary, Soros and his entire family were obliged to hide their identities and pose as Christians to avoid being forcibly housed in ghettos, interned in concentration camps, deported, or killed during the 10-month Nazi occupation of Hungary beginning in 1944.\nThe miscaptioned photo is easily debunked using a reverse image search. The young man in the Waffen-SS uniform is actually Oskar Groening, a Nazi who served at the Auschwitz concentration camp from 1942 through the end of the war. More than 70 years after this photograph was taken, Groening was found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews.\nWas Soros a Nazi Collaborator?\nIt is also claimed that Soros survived the German occupation of Budapest by becoming a Nazi \"collaborator.\" Fox News pundit Glenn Beck alleged in November 2010, for example, that the 14-year-old Soros \"help[ed] the government confiscate the lands of his fellow Jewish friends and neighbors,\" and, worse (in Beck's view), was unrepentant about it:\nSo when George Soros was 14, his father basically bribed a government official to take his son in and let him pretend to be a Christian. His father was just trying to keep him alive. He even had to go around confiscating property of Jewish people.\nNow, imagine you are Jewish and you have to go and confiscate the property of your fellow Jews. And you are pretending to not be a Jew and if anybody finds out, you're dead. He actually had to endure watching people sent off to their eventual murders, watching people gathering their stuff, sending them off knowing that they were going to go to their death.\n\"I don't want to question the 14-year-old,\" Beck disingenuously stated during a series of broadcasts devoted to painting Soros as an evil \"puppet-master\" of the left. \"I would have, however, liked to question the 80-year-old man who has never once said he regretted it,\" he added.\nCentral to Beck's case were quotes and clips from a 1998 60 Minutes interview (which can be viewed in its entirety here), an excerpt from which was also used as the centerpiece in a commentary on the conspiracist web site InfoWars.com in which host Alex Jones claimed that the teenaged Soros \"helped round up thousands of people\" and \"stole hundreds of millions of dollars\" from Hungarian Jews on behalf of the Nazi occupiers.\nConservative author Dinesh D'Souza (who has gone so far as to compare the 14-year-old George Soros to Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele) revived the \"Nazi collaborator\" claim in his 2017 book The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left, doubling down on it in a social media campaign to promote book sales:\nOther conservative and alt-right media figures followed suit:\nYet the simple truth is that George Soros neither said nor did anything resembling what he has been accused of. In no sense was Soros, who turned 14 years old not long after the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944, a \"Nazi collaborator.\" At no time did he confiscate (or help confiscate) the property of Jews, \"identify Jews to the Nazis,\" or help \"round up\" people targeted for deportation or extermination by the Germans (to answer just a few of the accusations leveled against him). And although Soros did attest during the infamous 60 Minutes interview that he regrets nothing about the time of German occupation, he also said it is precisely because he didn't do any of the things attributed to him that his conscience is clear.\nThe 60 Minutes Interview\nThe 60 Minutes interview is problematic in many regards, not least because Soros's testimony comes across as confused and contradictory. After assenting to Kroft's (inaccurate) statement that he \"helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews,\" a minute later Soros says he was only a spectator and played no role in that confiscation:\nKroft: \"My understanding is that you went ... went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.\"\nSoros: \"Yes, that's right. Yes.\"\nKroft: \"I mean, that's  that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?\"\nSoros: \"Not, not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don't ... you don't see the connection. But it was  it created no  no problem at all.\"\nKroft: \"No feeling of guilt?\"\nSoros: \"No.\"\nKroft: \"For example, that, 'I'm Jewish, and here I am, watching these people go. I could just as easily be these, I should be there.' None of that?\"\nSoros: \"Well, of course, ... I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away. But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there, because that was  well, actually, in a funny way, it's just like in the markets  that if I weren't there  of course, I wasn't doing it, but somebody else would  would  would be taking it away anyhow. And it was the  whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the  I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.\"\nSoros's biographer, Michael T. Kaufman, described Soros as \"visibly dumbfounded\" by Kroft's \"prosecutorial\" line of questioning during the interview. Kaufman addressed the claim that Soros was involved in confiscating Jewish property in his book, Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire (Knopf, 2002).\nWhile it's true, Kaufman wrote, that one of the jobs delegated to young George's temporary protector (a Hungarian bureaucrat named Baumbach) was taking inventory of Jewish properties already confiscated by the Nazis, the extent of Soros's participation was accompanying Baumbach on one of those assignments:\nShortly after George went to live with Baumbach, the man was assigned to take inventory on the vast estate of Mor Kornfeld, an extremely wealthy aristocrat of Jewish origin. The Kornfeld family had the wealth, wisdom, and connections to be able to leave some of its belongings behind in exchange for permission to make their way to Lisbon. Baumbach was ordered to go to the Kornfeld estate and inventory the artworks, furnishings, and other property. Rather than leave his \"godson\" behind in Budapest for three days, he took the boy with him. As Baumbach itemized the material, George walked around the grounds and spent time with Kornfeld's staff. It was his first visit to such a mansion, and the first time he rode a horse. He collaborated with no one and he paid attention to what he understood to be his primary responsibility: making sure that no one doubted that he was Sandor Kiss [Soros's assumed identity]. Among his practical concerns was to make sure that no one saw him pee.\nGeorge's father, Tivadar Soros, provided a similar account of the incident in his 1965 autobiography, Masquerade: Dancing Around Death in Nazi Occupied Hungary (note: Tivadar Soros gave the name of the ministry official as \"Baufluss,\" but Soros confirmed to us that the correct name is Baumbach):\nBaufluss was charged by the ministry with inventorying confiscated Jewish estates. He was home only at weekends; the rest of his time he spent taking inventory in the provinces. During the week George passed his time alone in Baufluss' s apartment. Lacking anything else to do, he caught the attention of some of his schoolmates, who lived in the building across the way. Communicating by hand signals, they seemed surprised to see him holed up in somebody else's house. The following week the kind-hearted Baufluss, in an effort to cheer the unhappy lad up, took him off with him to the provinces. At the time he was working in Transdanubia, west of Budapest, on the model estate of a Jewish aristocrat, Baron Moric Kornfeld. There they were wined and dined by what was left of the staff. George also met several other ministry officials, who immediately took a liking to the young man, the alleged godson of Mr Baufluss. He even helped with the inventory. Surrounded by good company, he quickly regained his spirits. On Saturday he returned to Budapest.\n\"He even helped with the inventory,\" Tivadar Soros wrote. It's a detail one doesn't find in Kaufman's book. Some may rush to cite this as proof that Soros was indeed a \"collaborator,\" but given that it occurred on only one occasion, and that Soros was under an imperative to play the part of Baumbach's godson while in the company of actual Nazi collaborators, it demands stretching the meaning of \"collaborator\" beyond all reasonable limits.\nMoreover, these biographical passages demonstrate that Steve Kroft's claim on 60 Minutes that Soros \"accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews\" is flat-out false. Tivadar Soros wrote that most of young George's time under Baumbach's care was spent alone in the latter's apartment. Both Tivadar and Kaufman report that George only resided with Baumbach for a short time  a matter of weeks  before Tivadar, concerned that his son's real identity was in danger of exposure, shipped him off to spend the summer of 1944 with his mother (who herself was living under an assumed name at a lakeside resort some distance from Budapest). George Soros spent no further time with Baumbach.\nDid Soros Serve Jews with Death or Deportation Notices?\nAnother \"Nazi collaborator\" trope holds that young George Soros helped send fellow Jews to their deaths by delivering deportation notices on behalf of Budapest's Jewish Council (Judenrat in German), an organization tasked by the Nazis with helping enforce Nazi policies on the Hungarian Jewish population:\nHowever, as in the case of the \"confiscation\" rumors already discussed, here we find innocuous facts about George Soros's adolescence twisted and exaggerated into a grotesque lie. According to Soros's father, school-age Jewish children were required to run errands for the council. Among those errands (he came to find out) was delivering deportation notices to prominent Jews. But although George did, in fact, spend all of two days as a Jewish Council errand boy, he didn't perform his assigned tasks exactly as ordered, taking it upon himself to warn the recipients of the notices that they ought not to comply:\nAs Jews couldn't go to school any more and their teachers couldn't teach, they were ordered to report to council headquarters. The children were enlisted as couriers under the command of their teachers. My younger son, George, also became a courier. On the second day he returned home at seven in the evening.\n'What did you do all day?'\n'Mostly nothing. But this afternoon I was given some notices to deliver to various addresses.'\n'Did you read what they said?'\n'I even brought one home.'\nHe handed me a small slip of paper, with a typewritten message:\nSUMMONS\nYou are requested to report tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock at the Rabbinical Seminary in Rokk Szildrd Street. Please bring with you a blanket, and food for two days.\nTHE JEWISH COUNCIL\n'Do you know what this means?' I asked him.\n'I can guess,' he replied with great seriousness. 'They'll be interned.'\nChildren are often good guessers. I wondered whether he knew what being interned meant. Did this child of mine realize that these people would be deported to Germany and very possibly murdered? I felt too ashamed of the world I had brought him into to enlighten him.\n'The Jewish Council has no right to give people orders like that,' I told him. 'You are not to work there any more.'\n'I tried to tell the people I called on not to obey,' he said, clearly disappointed that I wouldn't let him work any more. He was beginning to enjoy his career as a courier: it was all a big adventure.\nDid Soros Say Helping the Nazis was the Happiest Time of His Life?\nIn a foreword George Soros wrote for a 2001 reprint of Masquerade, he described the ten months of the Nazi occupation as \"the happiest times of my life\":\nI was fourteen years old. We were in great peril, but my father was seemingly in command of the situation. I was aware of the dangers because my father spent a lot of time explaining them to me but I did not believe in my heart of hearts that I could get hurt. We were pursued by evil forces and we were clearly on the side of the angels because we were unjustly persecuted; moreover, we were trying not only to save ourselves but also to save others. The odds were against us but we seemed to have the upper hand. What more could a fourteen-year-old want? I adored and admired my father. We led an adventurous life and we had fun together.\nPredictably, this statement has been repurposed by Soros's political enemies, usually in tandem with the false claim that he was a Nazi collaborator, as an admission of moral bankruptcy:\nBut at no time did Soros say \"helping Nazis\" was the happiest time of his life. As he has reiterated on numerous occasions, what he was referring to was the exhilaration of surviving the most perilous situation he and his family would ever face, under the guidance and tutelage of his father, whom George Soros saw as a heroic figure. \"It was his finest hour,\" Soros said of his father in his 2007 book, The Age of Fallibility:\n1944 became the formative experience of my life. I was fourteen and I had boundless admiration for my father. I absorbed and adopted his view of the world wholesale. As I have often said, the year of German occupation was a strangely positive experience for me. We were confronted by mortal danger and people perished all around us, but we managed not only to survive but to emerge victorious because we were able to help so many others. We were on the side of the angels and we triumphed against overwhelming odds. What more can a fourteen-year-old ask for?\nAnti-Defamation League Statement\nOne of the ironies of these attacks on Soros based on his survival of the Nazi occupation is that they use his own (and his father's) candid remembrances of the experience to vilify him. As Holocaust survivor and Anti-Defamation League Director Abraham Foxman stated in response to Glenn Beck's attempted takedown of Soros in 2010, regardless of how one feels about the adult George Soros and his politics, the attacks are morally repugnant and unacceptable:\nGlenn Beck's description of George Soros' actions during the Holocaust is completely inappropriate, offensive and over the top. For a political commentator or entertainer to have the audacity to say  inaccurately  that there's a Jewish boy sending Jews to death camps, as part of a broader assault on Mr. Soros, that's horrific.\nWhile I, too, may disagree with many of Soros' views and analysis on the issues, to bring in this kind of innuendo about his past is unacceptable. To hold a young boy responsible for what was going on around him during the Holocaust as part of a larger effort to denigrate the man is repugnant.\nThe Holocaust was a horrific time, and many people had to make excruciating choices to ensure their survival. George Soros has been forthright about his childhood experiences and his family's history, and there the matter should rest.",

Bellantoni, they asserted, told the tale of a hapless (but non-existent) man named Will Bottom, who claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff, his \"gay lover.\" To illustrate this supposedly abusive relationship, the article repurposed an image of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn, New York, man who suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked and beaten in 2013.\nThe real Christina Bellantoni never spoke to anyone from TheNetSpies and took to Twitter to make it clear the story was falsified:\nThis isn't the only unfounded rumor to dog Schiff, who became chair of the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",

Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence that Schiff paid off anyone over sexual harassment allegations, let alone used taxpayer funds to do it.\nWe found the rumor posted all over Twitter, and one December 9, 2018 tweet in particular from a QAnon conspiracy theory account, which simply claimed the information came from \"congressional sources,\" was picked up and retweeted tens of thousands of times. The rumor seems have emerged as Congress worked toward the bipartisan passage of a bill that requires members to pay their own sex misconduct settlements.\nThe rumor stretched so far that it was found in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Times on Dec. 13, 2018. That account also failed to list any sources to back up the allegation.\nA spokesperson for Schiff told PolitiFact the conspiracy theory is completely false: \"This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account.

The NetSpies posted a picture of the abused man, but the photo is actually of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013.\nBellantoni got wind of the story months later (around the time the rumor was spreading across Twitter) and called it out as fake in a tweet.\n\"Thanks for flagging.

This image appears to have been taken at a November 2019 Trump rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.\nThe BOK Center has the capacity for 19,000 people. According to the Tulsa Fire Department, the arena was less than half full during Trump's rally, with an attendance of 6,200 people.\nWhile the above-displayed post claims that the viral images of empty seats at Trump's Tulsa rally were taken before the event started, there are plenty of images showing these empty seats while Trump was on stage:\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump reelection campaign, disputed the fire department's count, arguing that there were closer to 12,000 people at the rally.

This is absolutely false.\nA look at the family lineages of each of these public figures provides further confirmation.\nGeorge Soros only brother, Paul Soros, died in 2013. According to obituaries published at the time of his death, Paul Soros had just two surviving children, Peter and Jeffrey. His two other children, Linda and Steven, both died as young children, according to The New York Times.\nWedding announcements published in The New York Times show Jeffrey Soros married Catherine Cosover in 1995 and Peter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997.\nSince George Soros has only two surviving nephews, Peter and Jeffrey, and neither married Gretchen Whitmer, its not possible Whitmer is George Soros niece.\nOn Whitmers side, she is the daughter of the late Sharon Whitmer, a former lawyer, and Richard Whitmer, also a lawyer and the former head of the health insurance association Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.\nWhitmer is married to Marc Mallory, a Michigan dentist. She was formerly married to Gary Shrewsbury.\nFalse claims have been shared widely on social media about both Soros and Whitmer amid the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nWhitmer, criticized for her strict stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been falsely accused of hypocrisy in following those orders.\nSoros, the wealthy Democratic donor who has long been a target of bizarre conspiracy theories, has been attacked recently with a bevy of false claims, including that he paid people to protest after the death of George Floyd.\n__\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

        "content": "Claim:\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is the niece of billionaire George Soros.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn June 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was the niece of billionaire George Soros:\nThe variations of this rumor that we encountered on social media were not accompanied by any evidence to prove this familial connection. In fact, these postings weren't typically accompanied by any information about how this alleged discovery was made, nor did they include any arguments (logical or otherwise) in support of this claim. These postings merely consisted of an unverified statement that was seemingly pulled out of thin air.\nThis rumor, of course, is a familiar one. Billionaire George Soros frequently plays the part of the \"boogeyman\" in far-right conspiracy theories (he has been falsely accused of owning a lab in Wuhan, China, of funding refugees to storm the border of the United States, and paying people to stage protests). In some circles, Soros' name has become so synonymous with nefarious activity that purveyors of misinformation can simply suggest that a person or organization has connections to Soros in order to stir up controversy.\nDuring the impeachment investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018, for example, a false rumor was circulated on social media claiming that Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was related to Soros through his sister's husband. This is not true. In 2016, as former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was running for president, a false rumor was circulated claiming that her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was married to Soros' nephew. This, again, is not true.\nAs we've noted in previous articles, Soros had one brother, Paul, who died in 2013 and is survived by two sons, Peter and Jeffrey Soros. Paul Soros had two other children, but they both died in infancy. George Soros has no nieces, which makes this claim about Whitmer false on its face.\nOut of an abundance of caution, however, we reached out to Whitmer for comment. A spokesperson simply told us: \"The governor is not George Soros' niece.\"",

Murray, who left public life a few years ago to pursue a more conservative lifestyle, found out he was dying about three months ago but decided not to make a big deal out of it.\nAccording to his spokesman and lawyer, Art Tubolls, Murray left very simple instructions for his passing:\nBill wanted to see America unite under President Trump and come together to fight against all the things hes fought against his entire career. When he wrote the movie Ghostbusters he used Slimer as an example of how feeding something causes dependence. Stripes was to teach the average American that anyone can be a hero if the timing is right.\nNone of this was true: at the time this report was published, Bill Murray was still very much alive and only 68 years old.

Adam Schiff (D-California) \"used taxpayer money\" to cover up a sexual-harassment accusation:\nIt's unclear where the rumor started, but on Twitter it was sometimes shared in association with a clearly bogus article from the junk news site TheNetSpies.com. That site is filled with obviously false information, and its \"About\" page states that \"If you like our reporting, kick up your feet, partake of your favorite intoxicant(s) and stay a while. If not, go ask your mommy to come down to the basement and nurse her 33 year old wuss.\"\nOn 11 February 2018, TheNetSpies.com published an article for which they alleged to have interviewed Los Angeles Times former Assistant Managing Editor Christina Bellantoni (which TheNetSpies misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). Bellantoni, they asserted, told the tale of a hapless (but non-existent) man named Will Bottom, who claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff, his \"gay lover.\" To illustrate this supposedly abusive relationship, the article repurposed an image of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn, New York, man who suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked and beaten in 2013.\nThe real Christina Bellantoni never spoke to anyone from TheNetSpies and took to Twitter to make it clear the story was falsified:\nThis isn't the only unfounded rumor to dog Schiff, who became chair of the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",

Adam Schiff, a Democrat who represents Californias 28th Congressional District and recently took over as chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\nA March 21 Facebook post displays a picture of Schiff with wide eyes and says: \"Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to reach sexual harassment settlement with a 19 year old male. Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence that Schiff paid off anyone over sexual harassment allegations, let alone used taxpayer funds to do it.\nWe found the rumor posted all over Twitter, and one December 9, 2018 tweet in particular from a QAnon conspiracy theory account, which simply claimed the information came from \"congressional sources,\" was picked up and retweeted tens of thousands of times. The rumor seems have emerged as Congress worked toward the bipartisan passage of a bill that requires members to pay their own sex misconduct settlements.\nThe rumor stretched so far that it was found in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Times on Dec. 13, 2018. That account also failed to list any sources to back up the allegation.\nA spokesperson for Schiff told PolitiFact the conspiracy theory is completely false: \"This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account. It is obviously and categorically untrue.\"\nGoing back a bit further, we discovered a story about a supposed \"gay lover\" of Schiffs on the junk news website TheNetSpies from February 2018. The site is filled with questionable content, and its \"About Us\" page states its content comes in \"the form of sizzling OP-ED, hard nosed investigative journalism, and a bit of satire for laughs.\"\nThe story claimed to have had an exclusive interview with former Los Angeles Times assistant managing editor Christina Bellantoni (which they misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). In a supposed Skype interview, Bellantoni allegedly told the site a man named \"Will Bottom\" claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff. The NetSpies posted a picture of the abused man, but the photo is actually of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013.\nBellantoni got wind of the story months later (around the time the rumor was spreading across Twitter) and called it out as fake in a tweet.\n\"Thanks for flagging. This is some very seriously fake news,\" Bellantoni wrote. \"Clue No. 1: A website youve never heard of citing an LAT story that doesnt exist.\"\nOur ruling\nViral social media posts claim that Schiff used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment allegation with a \"a 19-year-old male.\"\nDespite the rapid spreading of the rumor, not a single credible news source picked up the story. The account could only be found in sporadic, unsourced social media posts and partially in a junk news website that used a fabricated interview and a phony photo.\nThis conspiracy theory is full-on Pants on Fire!",

The text of the ad read: \"35 Foods That Should Never Be Placed in the Refrigerator.\" It showed a picture of eggs in a refrigerator overlaid with a large, red \"X.\" This seemed to imply that eggs shouldn't be refrigerated.\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a 35-page slideshow article. It mentioned 35 products that supposedly shouldn't be refrigerated.\nHowever, eggs never showed up in the story. The ad was nothing but clickbait.\nThe Dr. Health Magazine website did not list any medical professionals on its staff. The copyright date in the footer of the story was last updated in 2017. It did not appear to be a trustworthy source of information regarding health and well-being.\nShould Eggs Be Refrigerated?\nIn 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a rule to egg handlers. The announcement read as follows on the FDA website:\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a regulation expected to prevent each year approximately 79,000 cases of foodborne illness and 30 deaths caused by consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella Enteritidis.\nThe regulation requires preventive measures during the production of eggs in poultry houses and requires subsequent refrigeration during storage and transportation.\nEgg-associated illness caused by Salmonella is a serious public health problem. Infected individuals may suffer mild to severe gastrointestinal illness, short-term or chronic arthritis, or even death. Implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of Salmonella Enteritidis infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent.\nThe rule requires that measures designed to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis be adopted by virtually all egg producers with 3,000 or more laying hens whose shell eggs are not processed with a treatment, such as pasteurization, to ensure their safety.\nThe FDA also advised that eggs should be stored \"promptly in a clean refrigerator at a temperature of 40 F or below.\"\nAccording to The New York Times, the reason some other countries don't advise citizens to refrigerate eggs comes down to one thing: In the U.S., many eggs are washed at egg-production facilities to ward off salmonella concerns:\nWashing the eggs also cleans off a thin, protective cuticle devised by nature to protect bacteria from getting inside the egg in the first place. (The cuticle also helps keep moisture in the egg.)\nWith the cuticle gone, it is essential  and, in the United States, the law  that eggs stay chilled from the moment they are washed until you are ready to cook them. Japan also standardized a system of egg washing and refrigeration after a serious salmonella outbreak in the 1990s.\nIn sum, Dr. Health Magazine appeared to mislead readers by using a picture of eggs in its advertisement. The FDA has strongly advised that people living in the United States should keep their eggs refrigerated.",

And are they safe to eat?\nWe Americans, along with the Japanese, Australians and Scandinavians, tend to be squeamish about our chicken eggs, so we bathe them and then have to refrigerate them.\nBut we're oddballs. Most other countries don't mind letting unwashed eggs sit next to bread or onions.\nThe difference boils down to two key things: how to go after bacteria that could contaminate them, and how much energy we're willing to use in the name of safe eggs.\nTo understand when the rift happened, let's rewind. About a hundred years ago, many people around the world washed their eggs. But there are a lot of ways to do it wrong, so the method got a bad reputation in certain parts of the world. A batch of rotten eggs, which had been washed in Australia, left a bad impression on its British importers.\nBy 1970, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had perfected the art of the wash with the help of fancy machines, and it required all egg producers to do it. Meanwhile, many European countries were prohibiting washing, and Asian countries never got on board with it. The exception was Japan, which joined the egg-washers after a bad spate of salmonella in the 1990s.\nSo what's the deal with washing and refrigeration? Soon after eggs pop out of the chicken, American producers put them straight to a machine that shampoos them with soap and hot water. The steamy shower leaves the shells squeaky clean. But it also compromises them, by washing away a barely visible sheen that naturally envelops each egg.\n\"The egg is a marvel in terms of protecting itself, and one of the protections is this coating, which prevents them from being porous,\" says food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of Egg: A Culinary Exploration of the World's Most Versatile Ingredient.\nThe coating is like a little safety vest for the egg, keeping water and oxygen in and bad bacteria out. Washing can damage that layer and \"increase the chances for bacterial invasion\" into pores or hairline cracks in the shell, according to Yi Chen, a food scientist at Purdue University. So we spray eggs with oil to prevent bacteria from getting in, and refrigerate them to keep microorganisms at bay.\nWhy go to the trouble of washing eggs? A lot of it has to do with fear of salmonella.\n\"It just sort of seeped into our culture that chickens are dirty, or crawling with bacteria,\" says Ruhlman. (The Salt stumbled into this when our post started a #chickens*$!storm.)\nSalmonella enteritidis can infect a chicken's ovaries, contaminating a yolk before the shell firms up around it. Cooking usually kills the bacteria before they can harm you; still, eggs contaminated with salmonella are responsible for about 142,000 illnesses a year in the U.S., according to the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn some European countries, egg-laying hens are vaccinated against salmonella. In the U.S., vaccination is not required, but eggs must be washed and refrigerated from farm to store, and producers must follow a host of other safety measures.\n\"They're different approaches to basically achieve the same result,\" says Vincent Guyonnet, a poultry veterinarian and scientific adviser to the International Egg Commission. \"We don't have massive [food safety] issues on either side of the Atlantic. Both methods seem to work.\"\nThe important thing, he says, is to be consistent.\n\"Once you start refrigeration, you have to have it through the whole value chain, from farm to store. Because if you stop  if the eggs are cold and you put them in a warm environment  they're going to start sweating,\" says Guyonnet.\nNo one wants sweaty eggs. They can get moldy. Another perk of consistent refrigeration is shelf life: It jumps from about 21 days to almost 50 days.\nIn a lot of countries, constant refrigeration just isn't possible because it's simply too costly.\n\"Some of the countries cannot afford cold storage during the whole supply chain,\" says Chen.\nAnd as for why the U.S. and Europe developed such different attitudes about washing, it's also hard to tease apart how much is about safety versus egg aesthetics.\n\"In North America, we like to have everything superclean. So they probably initiated the washing of the egg very early on,\" leading down the refrigeration path, says Guyonnet.\nBut in a lot of places, \"a dirty egg with poop on it is no big deal. You brush it off when you get home,\" says Guyonnet, who was raised in France and now lives in Canada.",

        "content": "Claim:\nSamuel Pepys wrote about taverns being full of gadabouts during a plague in 1665.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn July 2020, a quote ostensibly written in 1665 by Samuel Pepys, dubbed the world's greatest diarist by some, started to circulate on social media. The passage lamented how \"gadabouts\" (defined by Cambridge Dictionary as \"a person who goes out a lot and does not worry about other things they should be doing\") were still frequenting taverns despite the risk of contracting the plague:\nThere are two slightly differing versions of the passage, one describing the taverns as \"full of gadabouts\" (as in the above meme), and the other describing them as \"fair full of gadabouts,\" as in the example below:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nSamuel Pepys, Great Plague 1665 MP and Diarist\n1633-1703\nThis is not a genuine quote from Pepys. This is a modern piece of writing that originated with a social media account parodying Pepys.\nPepys was a naval administrator and member of English Parliament. He was most famous, however, for recording a daily diary for nearly 10 years starting in 1660. Pepys wrote about several significant historical events during this time period, such as the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Great Fire of London, and the Great Plague of London in 1665. The above-displayed passage, however, was not written by him.\nThis quote originated with the Twitter account @Pepys_Diaries, a sort of parody account that reimagines Pepys as if he were a modern-day writer. This account provides a pretty big clue that these are not real quotes, as it uses the handle \"FakeyPepys.\" Also, it is noted in the account's bio that quotes from the real Pepys can be found on the Twitter account @SamuelPepys.\nOn March 20, 2020, the parody account posted the now-viral quote:\nOddly enough, this is not the only entity posting fake diary entries from Pepys as if they were written during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. On March 9, for instance, The Fence magazine published the \"Coronavirus Diaries of Samuel Pepys.\"\nPepysdiary.com, a website dedicated to Pepys' actual writings, addressed this misquote in a March 2020 article. The website noted that another quote from the parody account had also gone viral:\nTheres been a parody Samuel Pepys twitter account running for a while at @Pepys_Diaries. Its a modern-day take on Pepys, imagining him writing in the modern world. Unfortunately one of the accounts recent tweets, drawing parallels between the Plague and 2020s coronavirus, has been quoted out of context and spread around as if its a real excerpt from the diary. The tweet:\n\"On hearing ill rumour that Londoners may soon be urged into their lodgings by Her Majestys men, I looked upon the street to see a gaggle of striplings making fair merry, and no doubt spreading the plague well about. Not a care had these rogues for the health of their elders!\"\n(Update: Theres at least one more quote thats being passed around as if its genuine, but is also from the fake diary account:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nEnd update.)\nScreenshots of this, attributed to Samuel Pepys in 1664, get passed around Twitter and Facebook as if its a prescient example of Pepyss diarising. There are obvious things that point to why its not a real quote (as outlined in this Londonist article), and misuses of language that are apparent to those of us who read the real diary, but that doesnt stop those who arent too familiar with the period.",

Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

Im really looking forward to seeing this movie with yall and I hope you like it as much as Ive liked filming it.\nSurprisingly, the flick is being directed by none other than Clint Eastwood, a man you dont normally think of when you think of rap. Eastwood had his own comments about the upcoming film:\nThis movie was a big challenge for me, not only because of the subject matter, but also because its hard to dramatize a mans entire career like we set out to do.

        "content": "Claim:\nThe Missouri state government issued \"[N-word] hunting\" licenses.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2014, photos of a \"[N-word] hunting\" license circulated on social media sites, often accompanied by a message claiming the license had been issued by the state of Missouri:\nThe pictured license was not issued by the state of Missouri, nor did it provide the holder the legal right to hunt and kill African-Americans. It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

Did he say the language of the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values?\nFULL ANSWER\nThe rumor that President Barack Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools originated from a satirical article posted last month by a fake news website under the headline Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. The site is designed to look like ABC News, but uses the URL abcnews.com.co, the first tip-off that this isnt a legitimate news site.\nThe made-up story begins: Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. It goes on to say the order makes it illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty, which also applies to public schools. Those who violate the order, the bogus story says, can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.\nThe satire becomes abundantly clear for those who read on. The story includes quotes from Sock it Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks and Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.\nAnd then theres this description of abcnews.com.co at the bottom:\nabcnews.com.co: Thanks to ABC News President & CEO, Dr. Paul Horner for making ABC News the greatest website in the universe.

Paul Horner is an internet satirist who has created many fake news websites, articles and hoaxes. He takes responsibility for the pledge article on another one of his websites. The phone number listed for the complaint department, as well as at the bottom of the article as an Obama administration hotline, is the number of the Westboro Baptist Church, which is best known for its anti-gay views and protests.\nAn executive order with the number 13738 does exist, but it deals with labor laws and the federal governments use of private contractors. It has nothing to do with the Pledge of Allegiance. Obama signed it on Aug. 23, and the text is available from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. The National Archives also publishes an official list of all executive orders issued by Obama.\nThere have been legal challenges, dating back decades, to school boards and other organizations that require the pledge to be recited, concerning the under God phrase or religious beliefs. The Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette in 1943 that it is unconstitutional to force children to recite the pledge in public schools. The court ruled that it violates their rights under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. But this does not make it illegal to display or recite the pledge, or to encourage it.\nSources\nObama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. abcnews.com.co. 31 Aug 2016.\nExecutive Order 13738 of August 23, 201.

Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one  or more!  of CJ Trinidads shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

        "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994  and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork  depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries  was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\nThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994, the posts read. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airports public art available on the airports website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is not from DENs art collection. The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. Its called Children of the World Dream of Peace, but it doesnt include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting  posted by Trinidad days earlier  on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece Maskcommunication.\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, United Against Corona- Express through Art, by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the [d]ate of submission as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February  though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name NEHA appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting  and well update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994  and its false to say that its a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nBill Gates is being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations.\nDuring the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020, a popular social media meme asserted that philanthropist Bill Gates was partnered with business magnate George Soros in owning a lab in Wuhan, China (the presumed location where the COVID-19 outbreak originated), and was being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations:\nIt is true that the Microsoft co-founder, through his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has expended billions of dollars funding research and childhood-immunization programs in developing countries. Gates, who has long warned that we are inadequately prepared to deal with global pandemics, has also pledged to make billions of dollars available for funding the manufacture of vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a member of the Leadership Council for the Gates Foundation's Decade of Vaccines Collaboration effort launched in 2010.\nHowever, the meme jumps the rails at suggesting anything more than that Gates is interested in improving lives through medical research and vaccinations.\nGates does not own a lab in Wuhan, China, in partnership with Soros; that claim is a combination of two separate and false rumors that we have already debunked at length: that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was deliberately engineered as a bioweapon, and that Soros owns the laboratory in Wuhan where the alleged development of the virus supposedly took place.\nThe rumor that \"India is suing Bill Gates because he vaccinated 77,000 third world girls between the ages of 9 & 15 and many of them died\" is also a false one that we have explored at length. This claim is not directly connected to Gates or the Gates Foundation, but rather to the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), which conducted a study beginning in 2009 to see if it could reduce the number of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. (The Gates Foundation was one of PATH's global partners and reportedly provided funding for its HPV study.) The study caused controversy in India when seven of the girls involved in the trial in that country died after receiving their vaccines, but state investigations found those deaths were unrelated to the vaccinations:\nState investigations absolved the trial's managers  PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi  of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was \"very unlikely\" to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as \"unlikely.\" ICMR's director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: \"Based on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,\" he insists.",

(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" that covers over 8% of the Pacific Ocean.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nOn 26 July 2015, the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" Facebook page shared a photograph purportedly showing the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\":\nALthough the claim associated with the photograph  that a massive garbage patch covers 8.1% of the Pacific Ocean  has been advanced by some scientists, this image does not specifically depict that particular collection of ocean-borne trash. The photograph seen here shows debris resulting from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake (and resulting tsunami) that struck northern Japan in 2011:\nAn aerial view of damage to Wakuya, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area in northern Japan. Ships and aircraft from the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group are conducting search and rescue operations and re-supply missions as directed in support of Operation Tomodachi throughout northern Japan.\nFurthermore, National Geographic reported that while the name \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" may conjure up an image of a floating island of debris, the actual garbage patch itself was actually difficult to see:\nFor many people, the idea of a garbage patch conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics cant always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesnt show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes. The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nThe claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers \"8.1 percent of the Pacific Ocean\" is also a matter of debate. The number appeared to come from a 2008 quote from Marcus Eriksen, the research director at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation:\n\"Charles Moore, an American oceanographer who discovered the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" or \"trash vortex\", believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region. Marcus Eriksen, a research director of the US-based Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which Mr Moore founded, said: \"The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on. It is not quite like that. It is almost like a plastic soup. It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States.\"\nA 2011 study from Oregon State University, however, asserted that the real size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was hundreds of times smaller than commonly claimed:\nThere is a lot of plastic trash floating in the Pacific Ocean, but claims that the \"Great Garbage Patch\" between California and Japan is twice the size of Texas are grossly exaggerated, according to an analysis by an Oregon State University scientist.\nFurther claims that the oceans are filled with more plastic than plankton, and that the patch has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950s are equally misleading, pointed out Angelicque \"Angel\" White, an assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State.\n\"There is no doubt that the amount of plastic in the world's oceans is troubling, but this kind of exaggeration undermines the credibility of scientists,\" White said. \"We have data that allow us to make reasonable estimates; we dont need the hyperbole. Given the observed concentration of plastic in the North Pacific, it is simply inaccurate to state that plastic outweighs plankton, or that we have observed an exponential increase in plastic.\"\nThe studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically \"cohesive\" plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.\n\"The amount of plastic out there isn't trivial,\" White said. \"But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.\"\nBut a study published in 2018 stated the opposite of many of these assertions -- that the Pacific Ocean trash pile was much larger than previously reported and rapidly growing, that most of its bulk was larger objects rather than microplastics, and that about one-fifth of its volume came from the 2011 Japan earthquake referenced above:\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n\"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\nWhy the discrepancy? A variety of factors made it difficult to posit an accurate estimate of the debris field's true scope in earlier surveys:\nNo one knows for how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortexs area nearly impossible to measure.",

It was very clear that being a dad was more important to him than anything else. Our thoughts are with his family.\nRobin Fontenot, a dog walker in Palos Verdes Estates, visited Benningtons home Thursday afternoon to pay her respects to a resident she described as generous both to his family and the community.\nIts sad.

This is just who I am, this is what I write about, what I do, and most of my work has been a reflection of what Ive been going through in one way or another.\nHe also shared details of an abusive childhood. In a 2011 interview with the Guardian, he said: When I was young, getting beaten up and pretty much raped was no fun.

His close friend, Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, was being laid to rest at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. My name is Chester, Bennington told the mourners gathered there. I had the great privilege of being a friend of Chris and invited to be a member of his family. Then, accompanied by Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson on guitar, he sang Hallelujah. Bennington had become famous in the early 2000s as the powerhouse voice of one of rocks biggest bands, expressing himself through an angst-ridden scream, but that day his singing was different: plaintive, somber, fragile. He also paid tribute to Cornell on Twitter: Your voice was joy and pain, anger and forgiveness, love and heartache all wrapped up into one. I suppose thats what we all are. You helped me understand that.\nLess than two months later, Bennington, too, was being mourned. He died of suicide by hanging and was found on the morning of July 20th in his Palos Verdes Estates home in Los Angeles County, a week before Linkin Park were to set out on a 29-date North American tour. The singer, 41, had been on vacation in Arizona with his wife, Talinda, and his family, but came home alone, saying he needed to work. (Linkin Park had a photo shoot scheduled for the morning of the 20th.) TMZ reported that police had found a partially empty bottle of alcohol in the bedroom where he had died.\nBennington had always been open about his struggles with addiction and depression, but those close to him were shocked by his suicide. The day after Cornells memorial, Bennington tweeted that he was feeling very creative and had written six new songs. Around the same time, he told a friend, Rene Mata, We have to stick together, and we have so much to live for.\nEditors picks\nBennington had reason to be happy: Linkin Parks new album, One More Light, had topped the charts when it was released in May, and a single, Heavy, was doing well on rock radio. In addition to the Linkin Park tour, he was planning a reunion with his pre-fame grunge band, Grey Daze, for September. He was on top of the world, says Sean Dowdell, drummer for Grey Daze and a friend of Benningtons since their teens, who last talked to him two days before his death.\nSteve Stevens, who plays guitar with Billy Idol, remembers Bennington holding a new puppy while greeting everyone who came backstage at an event last October for Rock to Recovery, an organization for sober musicians. He was making sure that everybody got to meet the dog at the door, he says. It was so endearing and so Chester.\nHe was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, its horrifying  longtime friend Ryan Shuck\nOn Linkin Parks European tour in June and July, Bennington seemed to be in top form. We saw the most alive and present Chester of my 15-and-a-half-year history with the band, says Jim Digby, the groups director of touring. He was arguably in the best physical condition of his life.\nA few days before his death, Bennington had been texting with Robert DeLeo, his bandmate in Stone Temple Pilots (Bennington fronted the band from 2013 to 2015 after Scott Weiland left the group). His messages were loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things, DeLeo recalls. And the day before he died, Bennington e-mailed former Guns N Roses drummer Matt Sorum, saying hed like to perform again with their all-star covers band, Kings of Chaos.\nBut some of Benningtons friends now feel they overlooked signs that the singers dark side  which he called his dark passenger, a reference to the force that motivated the serial-killer protagonist on TVs Dexter  had been creeping back into his life. Bennington had gone to rehab around 2006 and appeared to be sober in the years after. But friends say he suffered a three-day relapse last August, during which he blacked out from alcohol, and had been drinking as recently as October.\nA month before his death, Bennington told longtime friend Ryan Shuck, who played guitar in Benningtons side project Dead by Sunrise, that he was six months sober. But Bennington also sent Shuck, who had his own struggles with alcoholism, some text messages that seemed portentous in hindsight: He was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, its horrifying. He was telling me, down to the detail, what he would do in the first hour he wanted to drink: I basically just take it hour-by-hour every day. \nBennington talked about his issues in an interview in February with Music Choice. I have a hard time with life, he said while describing the meaning behind the hit Heavy. Even when its good, I just am uncomfortable all the time. . . . The opening line, I dont like my mind right now  like, that is me 24 hours a day. And if I get stuck in here, like, I just find life really hard. It doesnt have to be.\nRelated\nShuck believes Bennington had a couple of drinks just before his death. We dont know how much, but it doesnt take much when youre that advanced an alcoholic and an addict and youre battling to the extent he described to me. You dont need much to lose your mind for a minute.\nShuck and Dowdell downplay speculation that Cornells death inspired Benningtons. While there are similarities  both artists hanged themselves, and Bennington did so on what would have been Cornells 53rd birthday  they believe it was mostly a coincidence. It could be a part of it, but its a small part of it, Shuck says. I think that its just another horrible event that gets put in your subconscious. Its kindling, but the fire was already burning.\nBenningtons troubles go back to a nightmarish childhood. He was born on March 20th, 1976, in Phoenix, the youngest of four children. His mother, Susan, was a nurse; his father, Lee, was a police detective who investigated child-sex crimes. They divorced when Chester was 11, and, feeling abandoned by his mother, he lived with his dad, whom he later said was not emotionally stable at the time.\nFrom the time Chester was seven or eight until he was 13, he was sexually abused by an older male friend. I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didnt want to do, he once said. It destroyed my self-confidence.\nThe experience led Bennington to explore drugs and alcohol. By his teens, he had used opium, amphetamines, marijuana and cocaine. Id drink so much that Id shit my pants, he once said. Bennington claimed to have kicked substance abuse the first time in 1992, when a local gang burst into a place where he was getting high with his friends and beat and robbed them.\nBennington poured his experiences into Linkin Parks songs, which mixed his soul-baring screams with Mike Shinodas rapping and the bands lumbering riffs for a sound that dominated the pop charts for much of the 2000s. He had a distinct voice, at once delicate and ferocious, says actor and 30 Seconds to Mars frontman Jared Leto, who met Bennington on the festival circuit in the 2000s (30 Seconds to Mars also toured with Linkin Park in 2014). Its the angel and the demon, sitting on both shoulders. You could feel the tension between the two when he sang, and I think the reason so many people connected to his music was because of that balance he achieved between the two.\nBenningtons songs, many co-written with Shinoda, became anthems for young people struggling with some of the same emotional issues.  Crawling, for example, is probably the most literal song lyrically Id ever written for Linkin Park, Bennington said of the single, off the bands megaselling 2000 debut, Hybrid Theory. Thats about feeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol.\nThose who knew him say Bennington didnt let his struggles define his personality. He could be funny in a juvenile way one minute (he was a fan of scatological humor) and deeply sensitive the next: Shuck recalls Bennington kicking himself endlessly after making a joke about lung cancer onstage.\nHis messages were loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things, Robert DeLeo recalls.\nBennington would sometimes tell bands that opened for Linkin Park, Next time we might be opening for you guys. Sorum remembers how hed asked the Kings of Chaos band members to do a gig shortly before Christmas. Bennington and DeLeo were laid over for 12 hours in Chicago, and the drummer felt horrible for keeping them from home during the holiday season. I e-mailed those guys and said, I apologize. Im so sorry. Thank you so much for going the distance,  Sorum says. And typical Chester style, he e-mailed back: Anytime, bro. There was no drama. Nothing.\nAt home, Bennington found solace in his six kids. Hed become a father for the first time at age 20, and first got married in 1996. That relationship ended in a tumultuous divorce, marked by a relapse where I drank myself to the point where I couldnt leave the house and I couldnt function, he recalled. I wanted to kill myself. He married Talinda in 2005, and the couple had a son and twin daughters. Leto remembers going to Benningtons house for dinner one night. I walk in and its just jam-packed with the biggest family youve ever seen, he says. I just couldnt believe that he had such a beautiful and thriving family life, especially for someone so young. I hadnt seen so much of that [in him], spending time on the road.\nHe always had enjoyable tales of his six kids, which he always referred to with a beaming smile, no matter what kind of parental woe might have had him do a double take, says ZZ Tops Billy Gibbons, who toured with Bennington in Kings of Chaos within the past year. His tattoo-parlor business was another highlight; he had me designing silver jewelry for the Las Vegas shop where we whiled away the hours talking shop. He was really an engaging soul.\nIn late July, Shuck paid tribute to Bennington at a private service in Los Angeles, where he read a eulogy alongside Linkin Parks Joe Hahn and Shinoda. (The members of Linkin Park, as well as Talinda Bennington, declined to be interviewed for this story.)\nBenningtons death is still resonating among his fans, who experienced a shock wave when the news reached the public. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline says it received a 14 percent spike in calls on the day after the news broke.\nTen days after Benningtons death, the singers home was encircled with a temporary six-foot fence. A police cruiser sat outside as fans left flowers, drawings, signs, guitar picks and crosses on its perimeter. When I found out, I was at a museum, and I just bawled my eyes out, said 19-year-old Briana Yah-Diaz. It was like a piece of my childhood went away. The little-girl part of me needs to come up and pay my respects. . . . I could always count on them.\nOutside his home, one note read, Fly free now! With love all the way from Texas. Another said, Dear Chester Bennington, It hurts all of us to know that you saved so many lives, yet we couldnt save you. . . .\nAdditional reporting by Steve Appleford\nAll donations to Music For Relief will now be directed to the One More Light Fund in honor of Bennington",

        "content": "Claim:\nA line from George Orwell's novel 1984 predicts the power of smartphones.\nIn June 2017, a quote, purportedly taken from George Orwell's novel 1984, spread widely online, forming the basis for several memes that presented it as a remarkable prediction of the power and ubiquitousness of smartphones.\nReviewing Robert Icke and Duncan MacMillan's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2017, the Australian news web site News.com called it a \"quote from the production\" and added:\nThe line is from one of the characters that works for the Government, otherwise known as Big Brother. He says: The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice whats happening.\nAnd in its review of the play, which came to New York's Broadway in July 2017, the Spectrum News NY1 TV channel also highlighted the quotation:\nPerhaps most terrifying of all is hearing O'Brien seeming to predict our current state of apathy, saying, \"The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what's happening.\" In 2017, \"1984\" resonates louder than ever.\nWhat neither of these reviews make clear, and what the many memes get wrong, is that these words weren't written by George Orwell in 1949, and do not appear in the novel 1984.\nDespite a thorough search of the 2016 Enrich Spot e-book edition of 1984, we were unable to find these lines in the original novel. However, they resemble a speech from the book, made by O'Brien, a member of \"the Party\" who works at the Ministry of Truth:\nThe proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.\nAt another point in the original novel, the protagonist Winston notes: \"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.\"\nThe earliest iteration of the quotation on Twitter dates to July 2014, during the play's second run at the Playhouse Theatre in London. (It was first staged in 2013). During the same run, a second tweet attributes the lines to the stage adaptation. However, soon afterwards, the quote began to be falsely attributed to the 1949 novel, rather than the 2014 theater adaptation.\nThe revival of the play in Australia and then New York during the summer of 2017 has led to a resurgence in social media posts and memes falsely attributing the line to George Orwell's 68-year-old novel.",

He said that the calendar will be sold nationally, and the collected monies will cover not only cover the costs of the campaign, but will create a fund to help families who can not afford prosthetics. \"[The purpose] is to promote beauty, to show that you have life after amputation, and that these patients can lead full lives that include attending clubs, hanging out with friends, and dating,\" stresses Nol.\nThe goal is to show that amputation is only a detail, and that beauty is a matter of attitude. The pictures are all in black and white, but the prostheses will be featured in vivid color images. The initiative is a way to show that physical limitations can not take away a woman's most valuable asset: pride.\nBanker Jaqueline Felizberto opened up in the photographs. She lost her right leg at seven years old when she was hit by a truck in front of her house. But the trauma has not hindered her life. \"I have a normal life: super, super busy, well run. I really enjoy my makeup, go out and have fun. I love the beach. I like to enjoy a lot,\" says the banker turned model for a day.\nCamile Rodrigues was born with a malformed leg, but that did not stop her from becoming a top athlete. At the Pan-American Games in 2011, the swimmer took three silver medals and one bronze. For her, the concept of beauty has little to do with aesthetics. \"Beauty to me is happiness. I think if you're happy, you're beautiful.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA man in Ireland earned the nickname \"Shawshank Husband\" after he dug a tunnel from his bedroom to a local pub over the span of 15 years.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nInternet legend has it that an Irish plumber spent 15 years digging a tunnel from his house to a local pub so that he could enjoy a drink at his leisure without his wife's permission. This story has appeared on several web sites over the years, and despite its rather ludicrous premise it has repeatedly taken in some gullible social media users.\nThis rumor started with a September 2014 post on the web site \"Tyrone Tribulations\" entitled \"Omaghs Shawshank Husband Dug Tunnel from Bedroom to Pub Over 15 Years\":\nAn Omagh plumber tunnelled a hole from under his bed to the local pub 800 feet from his house over the course of 15 years, a court heard today.\nPatsy Kerr had been summonsed to Omagh County Court after it emerged he had been the cause of a collapsed sewage pipe from a neighbouring house. Kerr told the court about his secret tunnel and the reasons behind it:\nThe wife has a bad snore on her and after watching the Shawshank Redemption on RTE one night in 1994, I decided to do something about it so I waited til she was in a deep sleep and then set about digging a hole under the bed in the direction of the pub. I used all manner of tools from spoons to a heavy duty tunnel boring machine I managed to sneak down there when she was at the shops. It wasnt until 2009 that I hit the jackpot and came up through the womens toilet mop and bucket room.\nThe story was picked up by viral web sites such as Boing Boing and BuzzFeed (both of which later admitted that they had been fooled) before it spread to less reputable sites such as 8shit.net. As of October 2018, web sites such as mens-corner.net were still presenting this story as if it were a genuine piece of news.\nThis tale, however, is just a humorous bit of fiction.\nTyrone Tribulations did not specifically mark this story as satire, but it was replete with sufficient ridiculous details to clearly indicate that it was a work of fiction. The most telling aspect is likely found in the closing paragraph, which depicts a wife who simply shrugged off the fact that her husband routinely smelled of sewage:\nThe tunnel was finally discovered after the DOE performed a survey on a sewage problem which turned out to be caused by a pipe Kerr had hit accidentally, causing sewage to leak into his tunnel over five years. The judge questioned Kerrs wife as to why she never smelt the sewage odours from her husband. Mrs Kerr simply shrugged.\n\"Gombeen,\" the author of the article, also provided some humorous explanations when readers questioned the authenticity of his reporting. When asked how this Irish plumber could have seen the Shawshank Redemption in 1994 when the film wasn't released in Ireland until 1995, Gombeen remarked that years work strangely in the Emerald Isle. And when queried why this man would bother digging a tunnel when he could have just walked out of the front door given that his wife was such a sound sleeper (she apparently wasn't bothered by the noise of his power tools), Gombeen averred that the floorboards in Omagh are extra squeaky:\nTyrone Tribulations frequently publishes humorous material that pokes fun at life in Ireland. Although the site does not carry a disclaimer explicitly labeling its content as satire, they do state that the accuracy of their stories \"cannot be guaranteed.\"\nWe reached out to the site to confirm that this was a bit of fiction and asked the proprietor, \"Paudge McGaudge,\" what it was like to unwittingly fool thousands of people:\nI completely made the story up -- that's what my website does ... short local fictional stories. I've written 1000s now since 2012 but that was by far the most successful. I just thought about it driving home from work and wrote it up on my kitchen table in about 20-30 mins in Sept 2014. Within days it took off. I think the big pulls were: it being read out on BBC Radio 2 during the day as a funny real story; John Cusack tweeting about it; and Buzzfeed running with it before they realised it was fake. I don't mean to catch people out and take no pleasure in doing that -- I just like writing stories to make people laugh.",

These dangerous foreign walk-overs who look more and more like real every-day normal Americans, lured with gift baskets and teddy bears, often blend into the very footholds of our societal norms after establishing dangerous toeholds.\nPalin, known as a vocal and athletic supporter of Donald Trump, said that she is now a double-barreled, locked and loaded supporter of both Trumps and Ted Cruzs proposed guidelines for stricter immigration laws, border protections and neighborhood scrutinies.\n-An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Mrs. Palins call for the removal of Aerobics from physical education courses. The author regrets the error.\nThere is no truth to this story, which came from a well-known (and prolific) hoax and satire news site. The joke in this case is that \"Arabic numerals\" (also known as Hindu-Arabic numerals) are the numbers most familiar to much of the world, and originated in India during the 6th or 7th century. They were introduced to Europe by mathematicians from what is now the Middle East (shown here as they appeared in the Codex Vigilianus around the 10th century):\nPalin has thrown her political backing behind Trump, and has been active on traditional and social media expressing that support. However, she has made no mention of banning numbers, whether of Hindu-Arabic or Roman origin.",

Although the Tumblr page stated that their material consisted of \"100% sourced and verified quotes,\" we investigated several of the entries shared by that page and found all of them to be false.\nThe Tumblr page made its agenda clear in its description, \"Get to know the psychopath known as Hillary Clinton a little better.\"\nWe attempted to unearth this quote in the pages of Clinton's 1996 book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, but (unsurprisingly) came up empty-handed.\nThe only credible publication to connect this quote to Hillary Clinton was the Tallahassee Democrat. That connection, however, was posted on 26 October 2015 (a day after the putative quote appeared on the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr page) and appeared in the web site's \"Zing\" section, which features opinions and \"snappy one-liners\" from anonymous users.\nWhile it's true that Hillary Clinton published a book in 1996 called It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, it does not include the statement in question, and Clinton (a parent herself) has not said at any point that she believes children should be raised primarily by the state, with their parents taking a secondary role.",

        "content": "Claim:\nImages shared widely in September 2019 showed people easily climbing the same fence, or same type of fence, that U.S. President Donald Trump said \"can't be climbed.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn September 2019, some online observers attempted to ridicule U.S. President Donald Trump's boasts about the impenetrability of his southern border wall by juxtaposing his claims that the wall could not be climbed with video footage of what was presented as people climbing the wall.\nIn a widely shared tweet on Sept. 21, one user wrote:\n\"Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed. But Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\"\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump's September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \"Trump's fancy border fence...\" while another user joined in, adding \"But ... he said that you could 'fry an egg.'\"\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \"This wall can't be climbed,\" next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump's claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump's election as president.\nAnalysis\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure's resistance, the administration had invited 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \"This was the one that was hardest to climb,\" Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they're unbelievable climbers. This wall can't be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it's also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it's designed to absorb heat. So it's extremely hot. The wall is -- you won't be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot. So if they're going to climb it, they're going to have to bring hoses and water and we don't know where they're going to hook it up because there's not a lot of water out here. So it's a very, very hard thing to climb.\"\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump's claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it's clear that Trump's Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president's claim that \"this wall can't be climbed\" were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump's long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. ... This wall can't be climbed.\" So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump's claims.\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does)  a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \"can't be climbed,\" in September 2019:\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president's assertions, \"Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\"\nHowever, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \"very, very hard thing to climb.\" Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump's boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

        "content": "Claim:\nPilot Flying J is removing American flags from their truck stop flagpoles because the flags \"offend foreigners.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 5 May 2018, Facebook user Dave Moore uploaded a video from a Pilot Flying J truck stop in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that a flagless Flying J location it displayed was the result of the company's attempt to placate \"foreigners\" who would otherwise be offended by the sight of an American flag in the United States (for reasons he did not explicate):\nMoore described (but did not film) a interaction with an unspecified employee who, according to him, openly stated that non-American customers requested that the flag be removed: \"I went inside the Pilot and I asked them ... they said they had an issue with foreigners coming here and complaining, and they didn't want to lose the foreigners' business so they took it down.\"\nIn fact the clip did not corroborate his claim, despite being made directly in front of the Pilot Flying J where he claimed the interaction took place. Although he shot a video directly after the purported conversation, he apparently didn't capture evidence that it happened as described (or at all).\nGas stations are frequently targeted for rumors of insufficient patriotism and various versions of the \"Shunned Serviceman\" urban legend. Modern (mostly invented) repetitions of the such rumors have circulated in Illinois, on Long Island, and in Holly, Michigan.\nIn some e-mailed variations of this rumor which we received, readers asked if Pilot Flying J had announced that they would be removing all American flags, everywhere:\nPilot and Flying J truck stops announced they were taking down the American Flag. They started the American Flag was offensive to the foreign truck drivers. Well screw them I will not stop or use these truck stops or gas stations ever again. I cut up my Pilot rewards gas card.\nAs is often the case with claims about \"offensive\" American flags or unpatriotic gas stations, Moore's story spread quickly, accruing nearly three million views in under a week. One day after it was posted, Pilot Flying J addressed the rumor on social media, stating that the store in question lacked a U.S. flag because a damaged flagpole there was in the process of being repaired:\nIn their Facebook post, Pilot Flying J reported that a \"team member was misinformed,\" but the company did not provide any more detail about the nature of that misinformation.\nA public relations firm representing Flying J sent us a response to our inquiry about the issue which stated that:\nI want to re-iterate that the current policy is that an American flag can only be displayed at our locations if it can be flown according to military protocol. The flag at store #436 in Amarillo, TX was not being flown as the pole is broken and prevents the flag being flown according to protocol.\nWe apologize the store manager did not have this information. We are still investigating all the details behind this miscommunication, but what we can tell you is what the situation at hand truly is, and that we are working to fix the pole at this location and are currently surveying our locations with flag poles to review if they are in proper working condition.",

My son gave me a potted plant for my birthday. I kept it on my kitchen counter until this week when it was warm enough to plant outside.\nI took it out to plant and tried to get it out of the pot with no luck. So I wet it really well, and the plant came out. It was in a decorative glass container with no holes in it and had a plastic pot cut and wedged into the glass pot. After I planted the flower, I tried to get the plastic pot out of the glass one by wedging a knife around the sides. When I did this, something moved. It looked like a snake, so I called my son outside. He took the liner out, and to our surprise, we found not one snake, but two baby copper heads!\nI almost died! I've been upset since then. When we took the plastic pot from the glass one, there was a piece of card board along the side. We think there must have been eggs in the holes of the cardboard at the grower's nursery. They must have hatched later.\nI am sending you pictures. Take my advice, and don't bring plants inside. This could have been really  really bad. This plant was bought at the grocery store. I will not give the name of the store, because I don't want to ruin their business. I'm sure it wasn't anything they knew about. It's the grower that should be more careful in potting these plants. I just want to warn you guys not to bring plants inside. Who knows what could be lurking under those roots? I am only thankful this was not a plant to be kept inside.\nThe lack of any identifying details about when, where, and under what circumstances these e-mailed photographs were taken makes their accompanying back story difficult to verify and leaves open the possibility that (as often happens) they were simply innocuous pictures to which someone else added a sensational (and fabricated) narrative to explain their origins. (Some versions of the message open with the statement \"This happened here, Columbus, MS!!\" but that line appears to be a later addition to the text.)\nEither way, we can make a few general points about what's described here:\nIt isn't unusual for snakes (venomous or otherwise) to occasionally turn up in consumer products and packaging (or in the stores that sell them), particularly at outlets that vend imported produce or gardening and nursery supplies (although sometimes such discoveries are more likely attributable to pranksters than to Mother Nature).\nRoughly speaking, only about 5% of the snake species found in the U.S. are venomous, so the average encounter with a snake is unlikely to result in any harm to humans.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a 6-year-old child working as a coal miner.\nIt's no surprise to students of history that throughout the American Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, and up until the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, many children in the United States were allowed  or compelled  to spend long hours toiling at physically demanding, hazardous, and unhealthful jobs for marginal wages. As one history of The American Era of Child Labor described those circumstances:\nAmerican children worked in large numbers in mines, glass factories, textiles, agriculture, canneries, home industries, and as newsboys, messengers, bootblacks, and peddlers.\nThe lucky ones swept the trash and filth from city streets or stood for hours on street corners hawking newspapers. The less fortunate coughed constantly through 10-hour shifts in dark, damp coal mines or sweated to the point of dehydration while tending fiery glass-factory furnaces ... By and large, these child laborers were the sons and daughters of poor parents or recent immigrants who depended on their childrens meager wages to survive ... By 1911, more than two million American children under the age of 16 were working  many of them 12 hours or more, six days a week. Often they toiled in unhealthful and hazardous conditions; always for minuscule wages.\nYoung girls continued to work in mills, still in danger of slipping and losing a finger or a foot while standing on top of machines to change bobbins; or of being scalped if their hair got caught. And, as ever, after a day of bending over to pick bits of rock from coal, breaker boys were still stiff and in pain. If a breaker boy fell, he could still be smothered, or crushed, by huge piles of coal. And, when he turned 12, he would still be forced to go down into the mines and face the threat of cave-ins and explosions.\nA meme commonly seen on social media attempts to vividly demonstrate the realities of the child labor era by displaying a photograph of a very young child (variously described as being 6 or 8 years old) who was supposedly working as a coal miner in the early 20th century:\nAlthough this photograph might reflect some realities of the child labor era, it does not literally depict a very young coal miner.\nThe child seen here looks too young to have been working in a coal mine at all. But even if he were, boys that young were not put to work actually mining coal, a job too physically demanding for such small children. Rather, they would be assigned other tasks, most commonly serving as \"breaker boys\" who spent their days at the labor-intensive tasks of separating slate and other impurities from coal by hand:\nFor 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into \"clean\" coal bins.\nThe work performed by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only at the end of the working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.\nThe original photograph looks to be merely a posed picture of a young boy dressed up with some props  he's gripping a tool (a pickaxe) far too large for him to wield, sporting a luxury he couldn't afford (a pipe), and standing in what looks far more like a photo studio than anything remotely resembling the environs of a coal mine:\nIndeed, the Western Mining and Railroad Museum in Helper, Utah, where this photograph is displayed, confirmed to us that the picture was taken in a nearby studio and does not depict a child coal miner:\nAccording to what we have, [this picture] was taken in a studio in Castle Gate, just outside of Helper, Utah. This is our most commented-on photograph in the museum, [and] it is interesting to see the wide range of reactions [it elicits], from amused to horrified. When visitors ask, I tell them this boy was not actually working in the mines, that [the photograph was] made in a studio. I tell them children did not work [as miners], although there is some reality to it, as the kids did go to work with their fathers [at the mines] at a young -- although not that young -- age. We have a display about what children did at the mines and child labor laws that I direct [visitors] to.\nIn sum, children did account for much of the labor force in mines in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with boys as young as 8 put to work in the countrys many coal mines under grueling and dangerous conditions. But although the photograph seen above is from that era and reflective of its characteristics in a broad sense, it's merely a \"cute\" staged picture of a little boy dressed up with props and not a genuine snapshot of a child coal miner.",

        "content": "Claim:\nRush Limbaugh's final net worth was revealed and it left his family in tears.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nRush Limbaugh's net worth was the subject of an online advertisement following his death on Feb. 17, 2021. The conservative radio personality died after battling lung cancer.\nThe ad in question featured a photograph of Limbaugh and read: \"[Photos] Rush Limbaugh's Final Net Worth Left His Family In Tears.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a slideshow article with 254 pages. Each page featured a celebrity and his or her purported net worth.\nWe clicked through the entire story. It wasn't surprising to us that Limbaugh never showed up on any of the 254 pages. The article didn't mention his name even once. The ad was nothing more than clickbait.\nAside from the ad, the article seemed less than trustworthy. For example, Parker Schnabel of the \"Gold Rush\" reality TV series was featured on three different pages. Two pages claimed he was worth $8 million, while a third page said the figure was $10 million.\nAccording to the story, former TV news personality Megyn Kelly was purportedly worth both $30 million and $55 million at the same time, an incredible feat.\nNear the end of the story, actress Milana Vayntrub was featured on page 250. She is best known in her role as Lily Adams on AT&T television commercials and has been featured in the past in misleading advertisements.\nThe final page featured Monica Lewinsky, who previously was the target of a similar ad.\nAside from lengthy articles like this one, some readers might often find net worth dollar figures that appear above Google searches. While these might be interesting for discussion, there's perhaps little data behind those numbers to support their accuracy.\nAs for Limbaugh's actual net worth, the real figure was not made public. A number of websites have mentioned an amount of around $600 million. However, several of those websites all cited the same source for the figure. That single source only publishes estimates.\nIn sum, Limbaugh's net worth did not leave his family in tears. We've seen the same \"net worth left his family in tears\" trope for former \"Jeopardy\" host Alex Trebek and a number of other celebrities. All of those stories have been rated \"False.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

Here is an excerpt:\nTrumps older sister is not happy about the behavior of her little brother, the President of the United States.\nMaryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trumps older sister and a United States Circuit Judge, told reporters over the weekend, Donnies not acting right. \nThe 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.\nI dont recognize the Donnie whos in the White House right now, added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.\nDonnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him Donnie Dimwit. But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and thats not good for the country.\nAlthough Trump does have two older sisters, one of whom is inactive Senior Circuit Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, apart from reportedly likening him to P.T. Barnum on a past occasion she has not been known to criticize her brother Donald in public  and certainly has said nothing on the order of the disparaging statements attributed to her in this article.\nThe spoof was apparently inspired by the release of the Michael Wolff expos Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which asserts that some of President Trump's own aides question the 71-year-old's mental stability and competence. The provenance and accuracy of some of Wolff's claims have been questioned by other journalists.\nHis fitness for office has been defended by White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who called him an \"incredibly strong and good leader,\" and by Trump himself, who issued a tweet saying he qualifies as a genius, \"and a very stable genius at that!\"\nWhite House physician Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson conducted a cognitive assessment of Trump during the presidents's annual medical exam and said he did \"exceedingly well,\" scoring 30 out of 30 on a test designed to detect mild cognitive impairment. \"I find no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process,\" Jackson said during a 16 January White House press conference.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Donald Trumps inaugural committee spent more than $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the nations capital as part of a scheme to grossly overpay for party space and enrich the presidents own family in the process, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\nThe District of Columbias attorney general, Karl Racine, said the committee misused nonprofit funds and coordinated with the hotels management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. He said one of the events planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, the presidents daughter Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates, a top campaign official at the time.\nDistrict law requires nonprofits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies, Racine said. In this case, we are seeking to recover the nonprofit funds that were improperly funneled directly to the Trump family business.\nIt was the latest allegation that Trump and his family have used public and nonprofit funds spent at Trump-owned properties to enrich themselves  part of the peril of Trump not fully withdrawing from his businesses while he is president. Trump has maintained ownership but turned the reins over to his adult sons, who have bristled at the charge that they are profiting off their fathers presidency.\nThe committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trumps inauguration in January 2017. But the committees spending has drawn mounting scrutiny.\nThe inaugural committee said Wednesday that it cooperated with the investigation and that Racines office hadnt contacted its lawyers to interview any employees. A spokesman for the committee also said the group had not been contacted by the attorney generals office since last summer and suggested the timing of the suit was politically motivated, as the Senate impeachment trial of the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress was underway.\nThe facts will show that the PIC operated in compliance with the law and this suit is without merit. In fact, it reads more like a partisan press release than a legal filing, according to a committee statement.\nProsecutors found that Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who flipped on the president during the special counsels Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms. In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was a bit worried about the optics of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said.\nStephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump who played a leading role organizing the inaugural parties, had also told Trump, when he was president-elect, and Ivanka Trump that she was uneasy with the offer, Racine said. Winston Wolkoff later followed up with an email to Gates and Ivanka Trump warning that the hotels proposal was at least twice the market rate, Racine said.\nBut Gates went through with it anyway, at a cost of $1.03 million, the suit says.\nProsecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didnt consider those options.\nGates pleaded guilty to charges tied to his lucrative political consulting work in Ukraine and was sentenced last month to 45 days in prison, a punishment that a judge said reflected the extensive cooperation Gates had provided to the Justice Department. Racines office said investigators did not directly speak with Gates in as they pursued the suit.\nA lawyer who represented Gates for the criminal proceedings didnt immediately return a message seeking comment. The White House didnt immediately return a message nor did the Trump Organization.\nThe suit contends that the hotel went against industry practice and refused to discount the space, and double-booked its largest ballroom with a different organization that was still affiliated with the inauguration, the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast. Both organizations were nonprofits, but the breakfast paid $5,000 for the ballroom. The committee, however, paid $175,000, the suit claims.\nProsecutors say the committee also used nonprofit funds to throw a private party on Jan. 20 2017, the night of the inauguration, for Trumps family  a $300,000 affair. The reception was for three of Trumps children  Donald, Jr., Ivanka and Eric.\nThere will be an after party at the OPO (Trump Hotel) following the inaugural balls on Friday. DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric, Gates wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump, according to the suit. DJT is a reference to Donald J. Trump.\nEvent staff within the inaugural committee recognized this would not be a proper use of committee funds and had tried to cancel this event, according to the suit, but Gates and the Trump family went ahead anyway.\nRacine said his office focused on the inaugural committee and the companies that profited because investigators believe thats the best option for them to possibly recover the funds.\nRacine had been sending subpoenas for months related to the investigation. The inaugural committee was also being investigated by New York and state authorities in New Jersey, who are looking into, among other things, whether foreigners illegally contributed to the inaugural events.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the inauguration was held on Jan. 20, 2017.",

Carroll has accused him of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman fitting room in the mid-1990s.\nIn an interview with The Hill, Trump said the incident never happened, stating that Carroll was \"not my type.\"\n\"I don't know anything about her,\" Trump declared. \"I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is -- it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that.\"\n(New York magazine and other mainstream news outlets published a different photograph showing Trump in the company of Carroll, her then-husband John Johnson, and Trump's then-wife Ivana at a public event in the 1980s. Trump didn't question the authenticity of that photograph but continued to insist, in spite of it, that he had \"absolutely no idea\" who E. Jean Carroll was.)\nThe image of Harth with Trump was taken more than 20 years earlier. Harth accused Trump of having groped her in 1992 in his daughter's bedroom. The picture was published during a 2016 broadcast of the TV news show Inside Edition, in a story about Harth's allegations. It can be viewed at about the 45-second mark in the video below:",

Rowling revealed that lead film actor Daniel Radcliffe is Chinese.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 6 January 2017, the satirical web site ClickHole, an offshoot of The Onion created to mock clickbait and viral content, posted a story reporting that the author and creator of the widely popular Harry Potter series had revealed that Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who portrayed the boy wizard in film versions of her books, is not English but Chinese:\nEver since releasing the final book in her beloved series, J.K. Rowling has been known to reveal some shocking secrets from inside the Potter universe. Whether its a characters hidden past, a plot point we may have missed, or a look inside what our favorite witches and wizards are doing today, Rowling has proven time and time again that theres still plenty we dont know about the magical world of Hogwarts. But the authors latest bombshell really takes the cake: J.K. Rowling just announced that Daniel Radcliffe is Chinese.\nWhoa. Mind = blown!\nAs proof, the web site included a series of fake tweets by Rowling, allegedly made on 6 January 2017:\nThe tweets don't appear on the author's authentic Twitter timeline, and according to available biographical information, Radcliffe was born in London, and neither of his parents is of Chinese descent.\nClickHole, like its sister site The Onion, is an openly satirical web site. Here's how ClickHole describes their content on the site's \"About us\" page:\nLets be honest: Today, the average website carelessly churns out hundreds of pieces of pandering, misleading content, most of which tragically fall short of going viral.\nAt ClickHole, we refuse to stand for this. We strive to make sure that all of our content panders to and misleads our readers just enough to make it go viral. You see, we dont think anything on the internet should ever have to settle for mere tens of thousands of pageviews. We believe that each and every article  whether about pop culture, politics, internet trends, or social justice  should be clicked on and shared by hundreds of millions of internet users before they can even comprehend what they just read.\nClickHole has one and only one core belief: All web content deserves to go viral.\nSome of the headlines on ClickHole's front page as of 6 January 2017 included \"Passing The Torch: Watch This Father Give His Daughter His Panini Before Walking Into the Forest Forever\" and \"One Day I Will Understand Basketball (by Jack Nicholson).\"",

It was originally presented as a reproduction of a newspaper editorial harshly critical of those who had voted for Obama in 2008, one supposedly published in \"the Prague newspaper, Prager Zeitungon.\" That mention appeared to be a misspelled reference to Prager Zeitung (\"Prague Newspaper\"), a German-language weekly newspaper from the Czech Republic which is also circulated in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Later versions of this same item attributed that editorial to Vclav Klaus, a Czech politician who served as the first prime minister of an independent Czech Republic from 1993 to 1998 and then as the second President of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013.\nThe attributions of both publication and author were unverifiable, however. The initial version of this item (which was circulated at least as far back as April 2009) provided no contextual information such as a publication date or headline that would facilitate verification of its publication in Prager Zeitung. A search of that newspaper's website at that time pulled up only one article that mentioned Barack Obama, and that article included only an incidental reference about the level of security provided to a U.S. president. No evidence documented that this editorial had been published in either the print or online version of the Prager Zeitung.\nMoreover, not only did no evidence exist showing that Vclav Klaus penned this editorial, it was exceedingly unlikely that he would have written anything like it. Vclav Klaus and Barack Obama appeared to have a reasonably good working relationship while both were in office, and Klaus had not been otherwise been recorded as writing or saying anything (in public or private) nearly so harshly critical of President Obama as the editorial attributed to him here.\nMarcus Hundt, the editor-in-chief of Prager Zeitung, confirmed that the newspaper has never published such an article ... about Joe Biden nor about Barack Obama and that it primarily reports on events in the Czech Republic and Europe and not on domestic affairs in other counties.",

Many of the baseless claims associated with the caravan centered on the idea that the group was violent and posed an immediate threat to American citizens. For example, one image shared on social media purportedly showed members of this caravan dragging a Mexican official through the streets:\nAs usual, this photograph was not connected to the caravan of asylum seekers traveling toward the United States in October 2018 and originated in a different time and place. This picture was actually taken in November 2014 and related to violent protests in Acapulco, Mexico, over the disappearance of 43 students.\nThis photograph was shot by Pedro Pardo and is available via Getty Images, where it is posted with the following caption:\nDemonstrators hold a riot police during clashes following a protest against the suspected massacre of 43 missing students, near the airport in Acapulco, in the Mexican state of Guerrero State, on November 10, 2014. Protesters angry at the suspected massacre threw stones and a firebomb at riot police in the Pacific resort of Acapulco on Monday, injuring 11 officers. Around 300 students, some wearing masks and armed with sticks and machetes, were joined by some parents of the 43 missing young men as they marched toward the city's airport, but police blocked their way. Mexico was confronted with one of the grisliest massacres in years of drug violence after gang suspects confessed to slaughtering 43 missing students and dumping their charcoaled remains in a river.\nA November 2014 news report from The Guardian provides some context to the protests associated with this photograph:\nThe disappearance of the students had already sparked numerous peaceful demonstrations punctuated by the occasional outbreak of violence.\nTension has intensified, however, since the announcement by attorney general Jess Murillo that a large group of young people were massacred in a rubbish tip near Iguala a few hours after the students were arrested. He said that the victims were then burned on a huge pyre for 14 hours, making identification of the remains recovered by the authorities very difficult.\nThe parents have accused the government of trying to close down the case.\nPrior to the announcement of the massacre, the authorities had said they recovered at least 38 bodies from nine mass graves near Iguala. Attorney general Murillo said four of these have now been identified as people who disappeared at checkpoints set up by Guerreros Unidos gang members and the municipal police.",

While a few odd coincidences exist, Simpsons prediction hoaxes may outnumber actual Simpsons predictions.\nFor example, \"The Simpsons\" did not predict that U.S. President Donald Trump would ride down an escalator while announcing his bid for president; Lady Gaga's Superbowl halftime show; the video game Pokemon Go; the fire at Notre Dame cathedral; a mass shooting during a screening of \"Black Panther\"; Trump's touching a glowing orb; or Trump's death.\nIn August 2019, after Trump mulled the idea of buying Greenland and then announced that he was canceling a trip to the area after Denmark's prime minister rejected the idea, another Simpsons \"prediction\" started to circulate on social media.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a message on Twitter about how the animated show had predicted the kerfuffle.\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow made a similar joke on Twitter:\nWhile these tweets were likely posted in jest, some people didn't quite get the joke. At least two threads were started on \"The Simpsons\" section of Reddit asking if the prediction was real, and multiple people chimed in on Twitter about the show's uncanny ability to tell the future. Murphy's tweet was also shared on Fark as proof that \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening had a time machine.\nWe searched Frinkiac, a website named after the Simpsons' bumbling mad-scientist character Professor Frink. The site allows fans to search the show's archives for favorite quotes and jokes. And nothing surfaced for mentions of the words \"Greenland,\" \"Trump,\" and \"Denmark\" together.\nFurthermore, we've previously covered the show's \"predictions\" about Trump's presidency. And as far as we can tell, the first mention of a \"President Trump\" came during the season 11 episode, \"Bart to the Future,\" in 2000. Trump was mentioned in prior seasons, but never as president or a potential buyer of Greenland:",

        "content": "SUEZ, Egypt (AP)  Salvage teams on Monday finally freed the colossal container ship stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal, ending a crisis that had clogged one of the worlds most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.\nA flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of the skyscraper-sized Ever Given from the canals sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged since March 23.\nThe tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule.\nWe pulled it off! said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired to extract the Ever Given. I am excited to announce that our team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated the Ever Given  thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again.\nNavigation in the canal resumed at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT, noon EDT) said Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal Authority, adding that the first ships that were moving carried livestock. From the city of Suez, ships stacked with containers could be seen exiting the canal into the Red Sea.\nAt least 113 of over 420 vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed are expected to cross the canal by Tuesday morning, Rabei added at a news conference.\nAnalysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end.\nThe Ever Given sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, for inspection, said Evergreen Marine Corp., a Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship.\nBuffeted by a sandstorm, the Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That created a massive traffic jam that held up $9 billion a day in global trade and strained supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic.\nRabei said an investigation would determine why the Ever Given got stuck, and he estimated daily losses to the canal of between $12 million to $15 million.\nThe Suez Canal is not guilty of what happened. We are the ones who suffered damage. he said.\nAt least 367 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, had backed up to wait to traverse the canal. Dozens of others have taken the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africas southern tip  a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.\nThe canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Mondays events after days of silence about the blockage.\nEgyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis, he wrote on Facebook, despite the massive technical complexity.\nIn the village of Amer, which overlooks the canal, residents cheered as the vessel moved along. Many scrambled to get a closer look while others mockingly waved goodbye to the departing ship from their fields of clover\nMission accomplished, villager Abdalla Ramadan said. The whole world is relieved.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Cairo tweeted its congratulations to Egypt.\nThe breakthrough followed days of immense effort with an elite salvage team from the Netherlands. Tugboats pushed and pulled to budge the behemoth from the shore, their work buoyed by high tide at dawn Monday that led to the vessels partial refloating. Specialized dredgers dug out the stern and vacuumed sand and mud from beneath the bow.\nThe operation was extremely delicate. While the Ever Given was stuck, the rising and falling tides put stress on the vessel, which is 400 meters (a quarter mile) long, raising concerns it could crack.\nRabei praised the team, saying they achieved a very difficult mission in record time, without damaging the vessel or its cargo.\nBerdowski told Dutch radio station NPO 1 the company had always believed it would be the two powerful tugboats it sent that would free the ship. Mondays strong tide helped push the ship at the top while we pulled at the bottom and luckily it shot free, he said.\nWe were helped enormously by the strong falling tide we had this afternoon. In effect, you have the forces of nature pushing hard with you and they pushed harder than the two sea tugs could pull, Berdowski added.\nThe crew on the tugs was euphoric, but there also was a tense moment when the huge ship was floating free so then you have to get it under control very quickly with the tugs around it so that it doesnt push itself back into the other side of the canal, he said.\nJubilant workers on a tugboat sailing with the Ever Given chanted, Mashhour, No. 1, referring to the dredger that worked around the vessel. The dredger is named for Mashhour Ahmed Mashhour, assigned to run the canal with others when it was nationalized in 1956 by President Gamal Abdel-Nasser.\nOnce the Ever Given is inspected in Great Bitter Lake, officials will decide whether the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship hauling goods from Asia to Europe would continue to its original destination of Rotterdam or head to another port for repairs.\nThe crisis cast a spotlight on the vital trade route that carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the worlds oil. Over 19,000 ships ferrying Chinese-made consumer goods and millions of barrels of oil and liquified natural gas flow through the artery from the Middle East and Asia to Europe and North America.\nThe unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, has prompted new questions about the shipping industry, an on-demand supplier for a world under pressure from the pandemic.\nWeve gone to this fragile, just-in-time shipping that we saw absolutely break down in the beginning of COVID, said Capt. John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com. We used to have big, fat warehouses in all the countries where the factories pulled supplies.  Now these floating ships are the warehouse.\nInternational trade expert Jeffrey Bergstrand predicted only a minor and transitory effect on prices of U.S. imports.\nSince most of the imports blocked over the last week are heading to Europe, U.S. consumers will likely see little effect on prices of U.S. imports, except to the extent that intermediate products of U.S. final goods are made in Europe, said Bergstrand, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dames Mendoza College of Business.\n__\nDeBre reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

Furthermore, no official announcements were made on 1 April 2018 about Daniel Radcliffe's return to the series, nor is any upcoming movie called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child or any derivation thereof in the works.\nHowever, this particular hoax was easier to believe, because it does have some basis in fact. A play by the same name, which is based on a short story written by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne (who also wrote the play) has run in London since 2016, and opens on Broadway in April 2018.\nSome Facebook pages have this poster presented as if it is genuine; others have admitted that this movie news was nothing more than a hoax:\nThe fan-made poster has been around since at least December 2017. It appears to have been created by someone who goes by \"BlueWolfArtista,\" and it was originally shared with tags such as \"concept art\" and \"photomanipulation.\" The image of the cursed child was created by altering a still shot of actor Asa Butterfield from the movie Ender's Game:\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a legitimate play, but whether it will become a movie remains to be seen  and it's a good bet that if it does, the announcement won't be made on 1 April.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

The man shown in the meme was born without arms and is not a veteran. Trump himself amplified the incorrect, debunked claim on Twitter.\nFull Story\nPresident Donald Trump can be seen in a viral image touching the face of a supporter with prosthetic arms  a moment that occurred during a campaign rally in early 2016.\nA purported story attached to that image, however, is incorrect.\nRadio personality Mark Simone, a Trump supporter, tweeted the photo on Sept. 4, claiming, I remember when President Trump met a veteran wounded so badly that he had no arms. The President reached out and touched his face so he would feel the human contact.\nThat story is wrong  and while Simone has shared it since 2017, fact checkers at Snopes debunked it a year ago.\nSimones recent tweet was then retweeted by Trump, who thanked Simone, and has been turned into a meme condemning the media that has been widely viewed on Instagram accounts such as republicansmovement and donaldtrump_2020.\nThe claim is being shared anew in the aftermath of a story in The Atlantic that quoted unnamed sources alleging that Trump made disparaging comments about wounded veterans and fallen soldiers. Other outlets have also reported corroborating parts of The Atlantics story, but Trump has denied the claims.\nSimone in a Facebook post, sharing the photo of Trump greeting the supporter, urged his followers not to fall for the Atlantic Magazine hoax.\nA reverse image search of the photo in question brought us to 2016 stories referring to a Trump campaign video about veterans that used the image.\nIt was actually taken at a rally at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina  and it shows Trump interacting with a supporter, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr.\nThe Chester News & Reporter published photos and an account of the meeting  during which Trump signed one of Stevensons prosthetic arms.\nChester News & Reporter, Jan. 19, 2016: Stevenson said Trump came over to him after his speech, asked how he was doing and how he got injured. He told Trump that he was born without arms.\nTrump signed Stevensons arm, a sign and his hat.\nIt is my first tattoo on my arm, Stevenson joked.\nLocal news reports in 2014 had covered an online fundraising campaign by Stevensons family to collect donations in order to buy a bionic arm. He and his mother relayed then, too, that he was born in 1991 without arms.\nNone of the stories reported on military service.\nWe reached out to Stevenson, but didnt hear back.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "The place where it was Christmas almost every day\nFor almost 30 years, Aviemore was Father Christmas' home in the Highlands.\nSanta Claus Land and Craft Village opened in 1970s with shops, a grotto and theme park rides.\nIt closed in 2002 and, over the next 20 years, the site fell into ruin before being demolished. It was recently replaced with a retail park.\nBut fond memories have not faded of the place where it was Christmas almost every day.\n\"I was 10 or 11 when we'd climb a 12ft barbed wire fence to get into Santa Claus Land,\" recalls Mark Allan.\n\"All the local kids did it. Eventually someone made a hole in the fence to make it easier to get in.\"\nIt was the late 1970s, and the heyday of Santa Claus Land, the year-round Christmas-themed park.\nMuch of Mark's childhood was spent roaming the park with his friend Dougie - after they had sneaked in over the security fence.\n\"Santa Claus Land was made up of lots of little attractions. I knew every inch of it,\" says Mark.\n\"There was pond full of wild birds with a sleigh ride round it, there was pony trekking, a North Pole attraction, crazy golf and a great pets' farm - with a goat that would butt its fence.\n\"For a young boy it was bit like a dreamland.\"\nOpened in 1975, near the centre of Aviemore village, the site had gift and toy shops including one called the Dolls House full of dolls for customers to buy.\nThe attractions included a ghost train and the veteran car ride that offered visitors a trip around a track in little vintage cars.\nMark says he was lucky to spend his childhood running around Santa Claus Land with his friends.\nHis mum Veronica Allan, but better known in Aviemore by her school days nickname Monka, also worked at the park.\nHer roles included helping to run the toy shop where the park's Santa had his grotto.\nMark says: \"My friend Dougie's mum, a lovely lady called Margaret, ran the catering and we would pester her for pancakes.\"\nHe remembers the park always being busy, with families from Glasgow and Edinburgh among the visitors.\nMark's first job when he turned 16 was at Santa Claus Land.\nOne of his roles was on the ghost train.\nAfter setting the train off on its way, he would sometimes run to hidden spots along the route and then jump out to scare passengers.\n\"The ride was scary enough as it was,\" joked Mark.\n\"I'd run back to the ticket office and sit there as if nothing had happened.\"\nSanta, of course, was the big attraction for families with young children.\nAmong those stepping into Santa's boots - while the real Father Christmas was busy in the North Pole - was the late George Swinney.\nMark says: \"I think he had been in the Navy. He was such a nice man who looked the part.\n\"In the village, even after he had retired, he was known as Santa George.\n\"My brother used to cut his grass and help him with his messages (shopping).\"\nRaymie Mackay, whose mum Sheila Mackay worked at the park and who later himself worked at the site, said growing up in Aviemore was special as a youngster.\n\"I would finish school and go to Santa Claus Land to meet my mum most days, so it really was Christmas all-year round as a kid,\" he says.\n\"Alice in Santaland was especially popular being a glow-in-the-dark ride.\"\nRaymie's favourite place was Santa's house.\nHe says: \"With toys from the floor to the ceiling. Full-size Lego models. A coin operated Hornby train set. And a Scalextric track.\nRaymie adds: \"And many a penny was thrown into the wishing well hoping for Santa to be good to us.\"\nSanta Claus Land closed in 2002 and over the following years the site became derelict.\nMark spent time away from Aviemore working and on a return visit to his home village was surprised by the state of the Santa site.\nHe says: \"Coming back one time, Dougie took me on a wee wander of the place.\n\"I was shocked by how overgrown it had become.\n\"It was very sad for me to see it in the state it was.\"\nMark, who now works as a manager on a Highland estate, says he is proud of what Aviemore could offer to families, and that the village continued to be popular with visitors.\nDavid and Julie Carman used to run the website Auld Aviemore and gathered dozens of stories about the theme park.\nThey said the park was a huge hit with locals and visitors, but in its final years a lack of investment and competition from low-cost holidays abroad saw the site fall into a \"sorry state\".\nDavid adds: \"But we still have our memories.\"\nSanta Claus Land is long gone, but its lasting legacy includes a street named after it.\nLocal Highland councillor Bill Lobban says: \"Almost all of the site has already been developed as a shopping complex.\n\"The only thing that remains are great memories and the name Santa Claus Drive.\"",

In Kvikkjokk-rrenjarka in Swedish Lapland, the mercury dropped to minus 43.6 C (minus 46.5 F), the lowest January temperature recorded in Sweden in 25 years, Swedens TT news agency reported.\nExtremely cold temperatures, snow and gale-force winds disrupted transportation throughout the Nordic region, with several bridges closed and some train and ferry services suspended. Several schools in Scandinavia were closed.\nPolice across most of Denmark urged motorists to avoid unnecessary trips as wind and snow battered the northern and western parts of the country.\nThe wave of cold air from Siberia and the Arctic region has also swept down over western Russia, with temperatures in Moscow and other areas plummeting to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 F), well below the average temperature for early January.\nOfficials in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other areas have issued orange weather warnings, cautioning residents against possible health risks.\nMild but wet and windy conditions prevailed further south, where a storm wreaked havoc in parts of western Europe.\nIn Britain, a driver died after a tree fell on his car in western England. Gloucestershire Police said the man died in the incident near the town of Kemble on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe storm, which has been named Henk by the official weather services of Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, has caused power cuts, transport troubles, property damage and disruption across the U.K.\nMore than 300 flood warnings were in place across England and Wales on Wednesday, while 10,000 homes remained without power. A severe flood alert, meaning a danger to life, was announced for the River Nene in Northampton in central England. Several residents were evacuated from houseboats and caravans at the nearby Billing Aquadrome.\nThe U.K.s rail network was hit by flooding and power cuts, with many operators reporting ongoing issues for the Wednesday morning commute into work.\nThe strongest gales in the U.K. were recorded on the Isle of Wight, just off the coast in southern England, where wind speeds reached 94 miles per hour (151 kilometers per hour).\nIn the Netherlands, police near the city of Eindhoven said strong winds may have played a role in the death of a 75-year-old man who fell off his bicycle late Tuesday as high winds lashed much of the country. The countrys water authority said a small section of a dike that regulates water levels was washed away Wednesday afternoon. The water was flowing into the already swollen river Maas near the city of Maastricht. Owners of a number of houseboats were being evacuated as a precaution.\nIn France, heavy rains have pummeled the northern Pas-de-Calais and Nord regions since Sunday, forcing the evacuation of about 200 people and knocking out power to 10,000 households, according to local authorities.\nRoadways in the town of Blendecques turned into waterways, and authorities warned residents in the areas under flood alert Wednesday to restrict their movements until water levels subside.\nHundreds of emergency workers from around France mobilized to rescue people from inundated homes and clear roads, and reinforcements of personnel and equipment came from Czechia, Slovakia, and the already-drenched Netherlands. Powerful pumps were brought in to divert up to 60,000 cubic meters of water from the worst hit towns toward the English Channel and lower water levels around the Aa River delta, the regional prefecture said in a statement.\nThe national weather service maintained flood and wind warnings Thursday for several regions across northern France and its borders with Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, with more rains forecast along with winds up to 100 kph.\nParts of Germany were also grappling with flooding, which could be aggravated by more rain falling in the worst-affected northwestern state of Lower Saxony.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Angela Charlton in Paris, Geir Moulson in Berlin, Mike Corder in Amsterdam, Pan Pylas in London, Jari Tanner in Helsinki and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.",

During the town hall, Cooper asked Biden whether he had brought up the Chinese government's human rights abuses, namely against its Uyghur population, in his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nBiden didn't say that cultural differences are a justification for China's atrocities against Uyghurs  instead, his meaning appeared to be the opposite of that. Biden stated that Xi implicitly understood he or any U.S. president would be expected to take a position against human rights abuses by the Chinese government. Here is a transcript of full the exchange between Cooper and Biden, with the key portion bolded:\nMR. COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We must speak up for human rights. Its who we are. We cant  my comment to him was  and I know him well, and he knows me well. Were  a two-hour conversation.\nMR. COOPER: You talked about this to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I talked about this, too. And thats not so much refugee, but I talked about  I said  look, you know, Chinese leaders  if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been  the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they havent been unified at home. So the central  to vastly overstate it  the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.\nI point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea Im not going to speak out against what hes doing in Hong Kong, what hes doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful  I said  and by the  he said he  he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they  their leaders  are expected to follow.\nLater Biden indicated that Xi knew that human rights abuses by the Chinese government would result in consequences:\nMR. COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just  is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What Im doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other  other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.\nWe reached out to the White House asking for clarification on Biden's remark.\nKedenard Raymond, director of communications for the National Security Council, wrote in an emailed statement to Snopes that Biden's comment conveyed the expectation that an American president will speak out against human rights abuses:\nPresident Biden has called the oppression of the Uyghurs a genocide, and he stands against it in the strongest possible terms. In that statement, the President was speaking about the need for U.S. Presidents to speak out on universal values, which are deeply held by Americans, and about human dignity everywhere. If you look at the preceding statement, the President stated: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. As he has said publicly and in the initial rounds of calls he has made to leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China, U.S. Presidents are expected to reflect the American norms and values of advocating for human rights.",

        "content": "Claim:\nUlta Beauty will close its doors following a buyout by competitor Sephora.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn April 2017, social media rumors circulated that makeup and beauty chain Ulta Beauty was closing all stores following a buyout by competitor Sephora:\nMany versions contained what appeared to be a link to an article about the sudden closures, (which sometimes appeared to be published by Curbed.com):\nHowever, all links led to a page that was mocked up to look like a phony article from People magazine (hosted at \"people.com-realsource.co\"), with a claim that Sephora's supposed buyout of Ulta would be beneficial for cosmetics shoppers:\nSephora Just Announced They Are Buying Out Ulta - Here's How YOU Can Take Advantage\nSephora just announced that they will acquire the 950 Ulta Stores nationwide, the first major announcement regarding the buy out in the new year. The mega-retailer will double in size and has already begun the liquidation process of Ulta products. To date, 18 of the 950 Ulta stores have already closed. The remaining stores will close by the end of the year.\nSome of you may be sad to see your local Ulta Beauty close down, but the rest of you are probably wondering:\"Will this benefit me in any way?\" The answer to that question is absolutely \"YES!\" On top of the final blowout sales that are going to be held at each of the closing locations, Ulta Beauty cosmetics department is offering FREE SAMPLES of their skin care products..\nThe scam advertisement then claimed that Ulta carries a secret product reserved only for celebrities and other high rollers, but now accessible to all due to the (nonexistent) liquidation of their products thanks to the (nonexistent) buyout:\nUntil recently, Ulta Beauty has always kept an amazing wrinkle secret called Vlamorous Cream reserved for their high paying celebrity clients. They reported that in order to clear the products off the shelves, they needed to give out free samples for everyone to try. As a result, a few weeks ago they shared the simple solution previously only shared with celeb clients to everyone!\nVisitors to the fake People site were greeted by a landing page that resembles the magazine's digital counterpart, complete with invitations to subscribe and a portal to other magazine titles. Clicking the links to other magazines leads to more scam sales pages:\nAttempts to close the page causes a window to pop up with information about a \"free trial\" with dwindling supplies. The page is not published by People, it does not report real news, and it serves only to convert traffic into sales for a skincare product it falsely claims was a long-kept secret at Ulta.",

        "content": "Cases have increased rather steadily since November, which saw four million new cases in that month alone, climaxing on Jan. 8 with almost 300,600 new cases that day. Even with dips in new cases later this winter, the numbers are still far above those from before November.\nAcross the country, the overall Covid-19 risk level is far worse now than ever before, according to coronavirus cases and testing data analyzed by The Times and public health experts. Right now, residents of most U.S. counties are at an extremely high risk for contracting the virus. (A county is considered to be at an extremely high risk level if it either reports more than 640 cases per 100,000 people during the past two weeks or has more than 10 percent of test results reported as positive.) And while cases have fallen from their record highs in January, an average of more than 3,000 daily deaths from the virus were reported that month. Go to this search bar to look up your county's risk level and to get suggestions about what to do to stay safe.\nAnd those numbers dont lie. Winter is a double-edged sword: We are more indoors, increasing our risk among those around us, and the colder, less humid weather can increase the viral load of the air were breathing in. Covid-19s fatty outer membrane becomes rubbery in cold weather  easing its transmission between people whose dry and winter-damaged nasal passages are more susceptible anyway. (Makes you want to throw on a mask, huh?)\nThe nose and mouth are the viruss portal of entry, said Rossi A. Hassad, an epidemiologist and statistician at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. How can a mask not be a barrier against an organism coming toward me?\nAnd just because this is the year of Covid-19, doesnt mean that winters stuffy friend, the flu, got the memo to stay away. As in other years, tens of thousands of people are expected to die from the flu this year. (A point of comparison: Covid-19 has a fatality rate at least 10 times that of the flu.)\nWhat we know about the flu, which has that same rubbery membrane coat, can inform us about the dangers and precautions we should take against Covid-19.\nComparing the two, Dr. Hassad wrote in MedPage Today: This Covid-19 pandemic has the potential to parallel the 1918 flu pandemic if we fail to comply with the protective measures recommended by public health authorities.\nSo far, more than 400,000 people have died in the U.S., with the country recording its first 100,000 deaths from the virus in late spring.\nIn addition to prime winter conditions for the virus, people across the country are also experiencing pandemic fatigue. Or as Dr. Stanley M. Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who has studied coronaviruses for more than 40 years, puts it, People are losing respect for the virus and letting their guard down.\nStriking a balance between restrictions and mental health, while also keeping yourself and others out of harms way, is important.\nSo what to do? If you are indoors, wear a mask, keep the recommended six feet distance from people outside your immediate household whenever possible, try to limit your time inside to only places with good ventilation, open windows when you can and crank the heat, if necessary. Humidifiers are also strongly recommended.\nBut if you are socializing with others, its better to stay outside whenever possible. One suggestion from the British journalist Oliver Burkeman: Embrace your inner Brit and suck it up. An umbrella over the barbecue? (Not a problem, Mr. Burkeman said.) Eating ice cream in your fleeces? (Still yum.) And, remember, just because youre socializing in the cold, doesnt mean you cant complain about the weather. (The Brits always do.)\nRead More Keep Your Loved Ones Safe Over the Holidays\nEven with a pandemic raging, there are things some have been lucky enough to celebrate. And you should: Life is short  you just dont want to make it unnecessarily shorter. So how do you celebrate safely?\nInfection rates have been on the rise as people began cozying up together indoors. In November, the month of Thanksgiving, the virus set new daily infection records: a million new cases reported in 10 days, another million in under seven days  a total of four million new cases over that month. And we similarly saw increases after the winter holidays  with a record 300,600 new cases Jan. 8 alone, just a week after New Years.\nSome celebrations are worth delaying indefinitely. (Have you really turned a year older if it hasnt been celebrated?) Others can be hosted over video chat. Or you can whittle down the party  masked up and distanced  to the people who matter the most.\nAnd if youre determined to gather, be sure to keep your guest list small. Experts advise limiting the number of households attending. (Its best not to mix households at all.)\nThe recommended 10-day quarantine ahead of gathering  or even a shorter restriction of your contacts is better than nothing. Experts also suggest driving to the destination while limiting contact along the way, keeping your mask on and doing your best to keep some distance from those not in your household. You could throw a test on top for extra precaution  even for local gatherings. (See below for information about testing to determine the best test for you and when you should get it. And get more information from the C.D.C. about testing here.)\nNo matter the location or style of the event, everyone should wear masks as much as possible when not eating and people from different households should do their best to keep their distance. The recommendation is keeping six feet apart at all times.\nThe best safe-hosting option? Move the gathering outside. Outdoor gatherings are lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, according to Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester. (Go here for some tips on safe picnicking.)\nIf you must host indoors: The C.D.C. has prepared separate guidelines about how to properly clean your house before guests arrive, as well as how to be a pandemic-savvy host.\nBefore guests arrive, open the windows. That can increase the air exchange rate to as much as three times an hour  just half the rate recommended for buildings by the World Health Organization.\nIf it gets cold, you can crank the heater  in fact, the C.D.C. suggests putting your central air and heating on continuous circulation. Exhaust fans (like those over your stove or in the bathroom) can also help, but dont turn on a regular fan  because that will simply recirculate the same, potentially contaminated air and increase everyones risk.\nOther ways to lower the risk to you and your guests is to limit the length of your celebrations, keeping shouting and singing to a minimum, and limiting the sharing of serving bowls and utensils. And dont bother getting out the nice guest towels. This year, paper towels are the way to go. The C.D.C. also reminds us to drink responsibly: Use of alcohol or drugs may alter judgment and make it more difficult to practice Covid-19 safety measures.\nDuring the pandemic, being a good host means letting your guests know the expectations and safety standards up front  so no one is uncomfortable by unexpected rules or the lack there of  and have extra masks on hand in case a guest forgets.\nBut if youre truly worried about getting Uncle Harold sick, stay home. It is the surest way to keep him safe.\nAnd remember, no matter how far you traveled to gather: If you develop Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, etc.) within 14 days of celebrating or later test positive, make sure to let your host know and follow these guidelines to keep others safe.\nRead More How to Celebrate a Birthday Now\nFor those of us who enjoy getting older  or at least all the attention that comes with it, you can still observe the day while making sure you live to see another year. For those in milder climates, park birthdays (everyone masked and distanced) may still be an option. (For those in colder climates, a park party is a good way to see who will scarf-and-glove up for you  you know, the people who really love you.)\nOtherwise, that virtual party over Zoom can actually be a lot of fun (Im speaking from experience)  so long as you limit the time and plan simple, interactive ways to get everyone on the call to take part. Dont pick a time too close to mealtimes  or youll lose people to their microwaves. Be respectful of not monopolizing peoples days. And if youre inviting people from different time zones (after all, this is the year you can have anyone and everyone youve ever loved in one  albiet virtual  place), be sure you pick an hour that isnt too late or too early for the guests.\nIf youre like my mother and think eating birthday cake in front of everyone (without a slice) is rude, you can suggest they bring along their own favorite treats, so it feels like youre all together. (Or just plough in, it is your birthday, after all.)\nThink carefully about that invite list: Who knows who, what personalities work well together and what do folks who havent met have in common? The simple answer to that last question is: you. So, your next step is figuring out how this group of people can pass the time together, and, again, that should probably be centered on what they have in common  again, you. So ask folks to introduce themselves and (if youre brave enough) share a funny or embarassing story about yourself. Its a nice way to get people laughing, talking about someone they all know and (I assume) love, without it starting to sound like a eulogy. You can also end with a short game as a sign off  like a round-robin story where everyone contributes one sentence with their goodbye.\nJust be sure to keep your guests tendencies in mind: If youre inviting a bunch of talkers, you can let people speak up on their own (so long as they dont scream over each other). If theyre a quieter bunch, you might want to call names  and regardless, thats a nice way to get the party started. (You can even let a close friend or two know youre going to start with them, so you can get rolling on a high note.)\nIf everyone enjoys singing or another particular activity, you can incorporate that  but just be sure if youre an opera star and inviting someone who is (um, well, not), you dont make anyone feel uncomfortable. (Youll know when peoples faces start blinking to darkened squares.) And speaking of appearances, just because you dont have to clean the house, doesnt mean that you shouldnt make an effort with a nice, festive background  via real decorations or your own Zoom creation.\nFor kids (and more festive adults, too), you can also go for a multi-tiered birthday celebration: in-person activities at home with the members of your household, as well as online or drive-by activities with friends. At home, endow your birthday celebrant with magic powers for the day  the chance to pick each meal and all the family activities. (Get ready for a few more sweets and even more noise than usual.)\nNot sure how to fill time online with your kids friends? You could hire virtual entertainment. There are still music classes and magicians and clowns, and they offer virtual shows. (The website Mommy Poppins has a good list.) Or, if you dont have the budget to hire a clown, you could always consider putting the red nose on yourself  and practice your juggling beforehand. (Unless you want the kids laughing at you.) Just be sure to keep any virtual party short and sweet  say one hour, with a start and end time. And to keep on schedule, signal that the call is wrapping up by introducing one final activity  phrases like before we say goodbye, or we have just a few more minutes to do X will cue that the party is coming to a close. (Both you and the other parents on the call will appreciate it.)\nOr, if your kid feels like hes at school every time he looks at his friends through a computer screen, consider taking the party to the street. Put a festive birthday sign replete with his favorite color balloons in the front yard and host a drive-by caravan, with celebrants waving, honking and throwing a requested candy from the window.\nRead More Go Ahead, Blow Out the Candles on Zoom\nAre you dreading the impending date of the day you have always dreamed about? The pandemic has ruined a lot  and has really taken a toll on weddings. Depending on cancellation fees, you may choose to postpone. (Lots of people are.) And if you want to be sure that you can celebrate in person with everyone you love, be flexible about choosing a new date  you wouldnt want to have to re-cancel. For those who cant afford to postpone, you can create a virtual component to the wedding, so that everyone can be there without actually being there. (But keep reading for the right way to do that  because while manners are changing with the pandemic, they arent null and void.)\nFor the newly engaged: Enjoy the moment  if you do it right, youll be engaged only once. In the interim, start talking with your partner about what youd like for the big day, and plan slowly. With people getting vaccinated, we will soon be able to start making plans like normal. But the process could be slow. No need to rush the wedding, just to postpone later. Besides, if you plan it too soon, you might lose out on your bachelor/ bachelorette party  and those will be far more fun in the near but undated future. (And remember, if you're in a holding pattern for the big day, data suggests that you're doing it right: the later you get married, the more likely you are to stay married; adding years of courtship ahead of the big day incrementally decreases your risk of filing for divorce later.)\nAs for changing plans, long-held wedding decorum may no longer be applicable, especially when it comes to uninviting guests. To avoid having to retract invitations, Steve Moore, an owner of Sinclair and Moore Events in Seattle, says couples should either skip the save-the-date cards or include a disclaimer noting they plan to adhere to state and federal guidelines for gatherings. Well ask in advance for your flexibility, understanding and grace, he offered as a suggestion on what to write. Just dont send a plethora of fake invitations, complete with parking information, just to recant later in a Facebook post with a link to your registry.\nAnd in some places, like New York, the one-time epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, large marriage ceremonies will be allowed starting March 15  with strict measures in place, of course. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo plans to release guidance about how such events can go forward, and any such weddings will additionally need to be approved by local health departments. Up to 150 guests could attend  with proof of negative test results, and venues would be capped at 50 percent (or, again, up to 150 people).\nNo matter what, be sure you are clear when communicating with your guests about any changes. A simple online blast, while effective, may not be sufficient. (You dont want a guest showing up just because she has the good sense to detox from social media.) Depending on the size of the guest list, you can call, or send a text or an email  or depending on the timing and nature of the changed plans, you can send a you are cordially uninvited to my wedding card. (A disappointed selfie of the couple could at least bring a few laughs along with the dis-invite.) But soon-to-be-married couples: make sure to emphasize that the change in plans is not because you dont love the person but because you do. And you can always tack on the promise of a second to be determined invitation. After all, with the stress youve been under, your first or second wedding anniversary might just call for a big party  when you can host without all of the pressure. (Paper and cotton gifts may not cut it in a post-pandemic world.)\nAnd if you really dont want to cancel, you could try to host a wedding over Zoom at the planned location or somewhere else  or switch it up to a drive-in theater). Or, just invite the people closest to you (thats often both immediate families and best friends, not all of your sorority sisters  unless you really are that person) to celebrate face-to-face, making sure they all get tested before you gather. (Please bring a gift and proof of Covid test.) #Covidwedding has 336,000 Instagram posts and counting.\nRead More What Will Happen With Weddings?\nThanks for checking in. Clicking on this question is an important first step. Now, more than ever, all of our tics and bad habits are coming out to play. And drinking is a particularly hard one  with the stressors of the pandemic, a relaxing glass of wine or two at the end of the day can so easily slip into a bottle or two.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald, a man who struggled with his drink and also lived through the Flu Pandemic of 1918, wrote of drinking: \"First you take a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you.\"\nIt doesn't have to be January to start a dry month  if you're looking to make a change.\nOf course, not all drinking is a problem. If you imbibe, it makes a lot of sense that you are drinking more now. The coronavirus can be both stressful and boring, and drinking can dull the stress of waiting without an end date. Although you might normally have enjoyed wine with friends, drinking alone  especially if you live alone  is not inherently frightening.\nBut we're dealing with a lot more now  working, schooling and parenting from home for many, and the drowning sense of loss of work and wages and the fear of losing even more stability for many others. It's enough to drive anyone to distraction  and to look for distraction, too.\nSubstance abuse experts have worried the pandemic may also trigger more serious drinking problems and even create new ones for people who have never struggled with dependency before  and data so far supports just that. Addiction  including addiction to alcohol  is at its core a disease of isolation. Feelings of loneliness can increase the risk of drug and alcohol abuse in people with substance-use disorders, according to a recent study published in Drug and Alcohol Review.\nThe United States was struggling with a communal drinking problem before the pandemic  the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2019 recorded more than 14 million American adults having alcohol-use disorder (A.U.D.), the preferable medical term for alcoholism. Now, sadly, binge drinking has ticked up during the pandemic, according to several studies. And a study by the RAND Corporation in September shows Americans drinking far more  across the board, 14 percent more often in response to pandemic-related stress, with the increase particularly noticeable in women, whose heavy drinking days shot up by 41 percent in 2020.\nIf you're looking to cut back, you're not alone. One poll found that 15 percent of Americans planned to participate in Dry January. But with January behind us, you can pick any month to go dry  unless you have moderate to severe A.U.D., in which case first seek medical attention, as untreated severe alcohol withdrawal can be fatal. Get rid of any alcohol from your home, as well as your ever-more-frequented virtual space (both booze-related and booze-inducing content on all your devices). Research shows that this extended time away from the bottle is the best way to get a sense of your drinking behavior  plus, it gets you on the fast-track to cutting back.\nAnd it's not just about the libations you're cutting out of your life. It's also about the joy you're putting back into it. After all, drinking has a few benefits: diminishing tensions and inhibitions, while adding a relaxing ritual to your day. (These days with most everything at home, it's hard to find when the workday ends and the rest of life, well, just continues on.) You don't want to replace one bad habit with another, but you can replace the bottle with other activities that bring joy and relaxation to your life  they may even be healthy. Instead of reaching for the bottle, call a friend to chat or if you can't get someone on the phone, write them a letter instead. Add daily exercise to your routine. Figure out how much you're spending on alcohol and start budgeting and planning a trip for after it's safe to travel again. Make a list of books you want to read and start ticking your way through them. Pick a new television series to watch virtually with friends and talk about it after. Or find something you're passionate about and start doing it (or doing more of it). Having a few go-to's is a nice way to keep from overusing one crutch while staying motivated to push on.\nAlso, try to quantify your drinking. If you can't keep track, you should consider what that means and maybe try keeping a drinking journal or a simple tally. Or, if you prefer an app to help you keep track, try Drink Control or Drinks Meter, which helps you track your drinks while also contextualizing your number compared with an anonymous database of over 6,000 other people's drinking habits across the world.\nSomething very interesting happens when we put things on paper, said Laura McKowen, who once started a journal of her own to confront her drinking problem. \"Because we have a lot of cognitive dissonance around drinking.\nThere is no right answer as to when its time for you to be worried. Some questions, though, might help you get a clearer sense of the problem. Among others, you can check out the free alcohol screener from CheckUp & Choices.\nAnd here are a few questions to consider, which are drawn from ones developed by rehabilitation facilities and medical centers: How many days a week do you drink? When you drink, how many drinks do you have? Is there a time of day that you most want to drink? Can you sleep without a drink?\nWhat about your attitude toward drinking: Do you get angry or irritable when someone tries to take your drink away, or suggests that you may have a problem? Are you secretive about drinking?\nAnd, primarily, have your drinking patterns changed drastically since the pandemic started? Have you had major life changes  beyond lockdown  like losing your job or the death of a relative? (You may be looking for solace from these stressors at the bottom of your glass.)\nIf your answer to some, or many of these questions, is yes, it may be time to step back and reconsider. And if you try a sobriety month and find that going without alcohol is painfully difficult, you could have A.U.D., which is a disease necessitating treatment and is not your fault. Check out this N.I.A.A.A. navigator to determine the right treatment for you, and then use this services locator to find the help you need.\nSocial settings are an important part of recovery, and many treatment centers have closed down or greatly limited their in-person meetings, with a concentrated number of closures in the Northeast, because of New York being at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States this past spring. Although in-person meetings aren't an available option for many during the health crisis, a plethora of virtual support groups gather for meetings from the comfort of their beds or couches.\nIf you are looking to join a free virtual support group, there are many communities to choose from, among them: Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, SheRecovers, In the Rooms , Eight Step Recovery , Refuge Recovery , Recovery Dharma and LifeRing.\nMs. McKowen, author of We Are the Luckiest: The Surprising Magic of a Sober Life,\" also founded the Luckiest Club, a virtual community group with membership and classes available for people struggling with drinking. Or try the online recovery program Tempest, which has different membership options depending on the intensity of the program you choose.\nSome groups are also designed for people of color or belonging to certain age groups, interests and professions  like the sobriety support group Bens Friends, built for those in the restaurant industry, which has a notably difficult relationship with alcohol consumption. Another one: the Sober Mom Squad. Want to date without worrying about alcohol?

And these certainly aren't those.\nDuring the pandemic, people's anxiety and depression have shot up  and that includes young adults. If you're looking for someone to talk to, you're not alone.\nFor starters, therapy is different than counseling, both of which have merits. In many states, a \"therapist\" (providing therapy) is licensed, while a \"counselor\" is not. Our below recommendations are for therapists, although you should go with the person you're most comfortable talking to.\nTherapy can be time-intensive and expensive. If you have insurance, figure out who is covered under your plan and narrow your choices from there. Regardless of insurance, if you are able to make it work, then consider following these steps:\n1. Determine what type of professional help you need.\nIf youre mostly looking to talk, a psychologist (someone who cannot prescribe medicaton) is a good bet.\nBut if you have a specific ailment  panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, sociopathy, borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia  you should see a psychiatrist (someone who can prescribe medication) or a psychologist with considerable experience in that specialty.\n2. Next, consider if you're ready to go into the therapist's office or if you'd prefer virtual therapy.\nVideo therapy is backed by peer-reviewed research and mirrors an in-person appointment, unlike text-based therapy services. In fact, teletherapy may be as effective as in-person therapy (and certainly has some advantages right now).\nTherapists say it gives them a literal window into your home, which can make for more effective therapy, depending on the situation. And it's more convenient and sometimes less expensive than in-person consultations. Go to Psychology Todays therapist finder to compare online and in-person therapy options where you live. As long as the therapist is licensed in your state, video appointments can expand your search beyond your immediate geographic area. (Of note: The selection of online therapists is still fairly limited, especially in some less-populous states.)\nIf you want to go the online route, we suggest searching for an online therapist with Amwell. (We're not making this suggestion lightly: Our reporters researched five platforms for more than 70 hours, going to appointments with each over a two-year period.) The service is private, secure, accredited and accepts insurance. It also offers more therapists than the competition  increasing your chances of finding someone who fits your schedule and needs.\nPlus, you know how annoying it is when you're video-calling someone and then your eyes wander to that little square with your face in it? (Is that a hair out of place? Do I really look like that? What am I doing with my hands? Wait, what were we talking about, again?) Well, with Amwell you can hide yourself, making your session feel a bit more like a real-life conversation.\nOther teletherapy services include MDLive and Doctor on Demand, among others. You might also consider these newish mental health startups, which also provide virtual services, among them: Real Therapy, Cerebral. (Of note: since the pandemic, Medicare has changed its policies to cover most telehealth, and the same goes for many private insurance companies.)\nSome people are even finding connection through TikTok, where therapists sometimes post in their PJ's and the usual walls are down. The burgeoning of mental health content has come when more and more people are feeling down and seeking connection. Of course, the 60-second video platform should not be the end of your therapy search, but it might be a toe in.\nNow, if you're in a home situation where you can't safely talk, you could consider counseling or therapy services through texting apps like BetterHelp and Talkspace, both of which have seen an uptick in users since the start of the pandemic. While this does not provide the same interpersonal connection, depending on your circumstances it may be the safest bet. The most important thing is to reach out for help. (Also check out our question: \"Im worried that I, or my friend, might be suffering domestic abuse. What should I do?\" for more information about what to do to get out of a bad situation. We've including help numbers and chat lines, too.)\n3. Then, set up a few preliminary calls and consultations. The getting-to-know-you session is often free, and you should take it as an opportunity to talk about what you are looking for from therapy, and learn how each therapist approaches their practice.\n4. Whether online or in person, you might click with someone the same way you would with a new friend. And theres nothing wrong with trying a few initial appointments to learn about your own wants and desires.\nRead More Questions to Ask a Prospective Therapist (from Your Own Couch)\nSeems like it's getting harder and harder to fall asleep and stay asleep these days. And while there's no catch-all fix to getting good night's sleep, staying on a consistent schedule is certainly a good start to improving your sleep. (That means sticking to a regular wake and bedtime, and setting up a relaxing pre-sleep routine that helps you wind down before you even get under the covers.)\nNot to give you something else to contemplate when you should be counting sheep, but sleeping seven hours a night is linked to a healthier, longer life. (Eight hours a night is the magic number that most adults need.) And sleeping less than that is associated with a nightmarish assortment of problems: obesity, heart disease, depression and impaired immune function, among others. (And we could all use a high-functioning immune system right about now.)\nIn fact one study links a decrease in sleep to an uptick in your risk of getting sick and without sleep you're curbing your body's abilty to produce cytokine, a protein boosting your immune system's response to antigens. Even less than a week of really bad sleep, one study found, can cut a healthy young person's typical number of antibodies to a flu vaccine in half.\nWe all come with a 24-hour internal clock that keeps us in time with the earth, but genetics, age and our personal habits throw that timer off. If you're not sure where you fall on the spectrum of lark to night owl, take this sleep quiz.\nAnd keeping a simple sleep log for one week (here's our sleep diary worksheet) can help you determine any issues with sleep:\n1. Note the time you go to bed and the time you wake up.\n2. Now do the math: how many hours did you get?\n3. Are you waking up in the middle of the night? Also note any mid-day siestas.\n4. In the morning ask yourself: Am I tired? (Hint: If you're falling asleep throughout the day, or longing to curl up for a nap, then the answer is: \"Yes.\") And if you're getting that seven to eight hours and you're still answering \"Yes,\" then it may be about the quality, not the quantity, of sleep you're getting; you could be experiencing interrupted sleep or a sleep disorder, so talk with a doctor or undergo a sleep study, so you can take advantage of those sacred hours of shut-eye.\nTo reset that internal clock, start with a goal: When do you want to wake up each morning? (And be honest, how does that compare to when you're actually waking up?) Begin waking up 20 minutes earlier each day, inching toward that goal wakeup time. (Hopefully, of course, you'll also be getting to bed 20 minutes earlier each night, too.) And whatever you do, don't mix it up on the weekends. It should go without saying, but: go to bed when you're sleepy  your body wants to get back on rythm, so let it.\nAnd if you want to avoid those hours tossing and turning after your head hits the pillow, consider incorporating some or all of the below:\nBefore Bed:\n-Nix that late cup of coffee (obviously). Also, alcohol (which leads to fragmented sleep), as well as any food (no need for the heartburn or the extra inches around the waist).\n-Cut the screentime 90 minutes before bed. (That means no emails, social media or TV.) Might we instead suggest some more soothing options: take a bath or read a book. And if you're still doubtful of your willpower, start small with 15 minutes away from the screen and continue cutting back.\n-Make a list of what you need to do the next day and then let it leave your mind. It's written down  for tomorrow.\n-Your bedroom should be a place of rest. Don't leave out unfinished work, exercise equipment or other stress-inducing reminders from the day. (And yep, that includes television and other news media.)\n-Sleeping pills could help, but you may want to talk to a doctor first. One option could be melatonin supplements. But be sure to read the pill bottle for what you can and can't take with any medication. (Sleeping medication might be another good reason to cut down on the alcohol: you shouldn't be mixing it with melatonin supplements, for instance.) Better yet, try these drugless alternatives.\n-If you have a hard time waking up, then leave the blinds open so the natural light will stream into your room in the morning, gently nudging you to consciousness. (And if you have a work shift that requires you to work nights, consider investing in blackout curtains.)\nIn the morning:\n-Get up with your alarm clock  and don't even think about hitting snooze. (Pro tip: if you're not waking up to your alarm clock, then buy a louder one or switch up the ring tone.)\n-Head outside for at least 15 minutes of sunlight early in the day. The sun nudges you awake and has other positive effects for the mind and body.\n-Yep, actually eat breakfast. Not only is it good for your metabolism, but it also gets you into a good grove from the start.\n-Get moving earlier in the day: Working out (a socially distanced walk or at-home routine) uses up that nervous energy and tires you out by the end of the day. Just be sure not to get your blood flowing too close to bedtime, or you'll be wide-eyed (and sweaty).\n-To the extent possible, throughout the day try to keep to a routine: eating around the same time and winding down, too.\n-If you need a nap, take it between 1 and 3 p.m. But don't let the nap become your sleeping problem. Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist who studies the connection between behavior and sleep, recommends keeping it short: 10 to 20 minutes should do it. (Yep, your cat really has been doing it right all along.)\nRead More How to Get More Sleep Tonight and Every Night After\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a single person a year into the pandemic must be in want of a partner ... and that a couple one year in must be in want of, well, a little more alone time.\nIn some cases, the pandemic has fast-tracked relationships, and couples who have known each other for only a short time find themselves cohabitating or even heading down the aisle. In other cases, couples break up, and divorce rates are rising in some places. What this all reminds us is that relationships, too, relationships, too, must live or die by the pandemic.\nIf youre cohabitating, you could be in a tough spot. If youre not, while your situation could not be more different, you may similarly find yourself with difficult decisions to make: youve probably had to figure out ways to see each other  or not  that feel safe and nurturing for both of you, as well as those in your inner-circles.\nOr as Eric Spiegelman, a podcasting executive in Los Angeles, tweeted in April, My wife and I play this fun game during quarantine, its called Why Are You Doing It That Way? and there are no winners.\" (It got over 400,000 likes and some 47,000 retweets. Apparently, a lot of us have been playing that game.)\n\"The traditional marriage vows are 'for better or for worse,'\" said Jean Fitzpatrick, a relationship therapist in Manhattan. This is for worse. And so, how do we navigate a time like this? Our relationships will either grow as a result, or they will be harmed.\"\nLong before the pandemic, one married couple tied themselves together with a 15-foot string for a whole day and wrote about their experience for Slate. We dont have any stories to tell each other about our day because we lived the same day, David Plotz, the husband in the article, wrote. We dont have questions for each other because we know the answers. We cant lie and exaggerate and twist the days happenings to gain sympathy  the usual evening activity for most married couples, I suspect  because the other will call foul. Sound familiar?\nIf it's too late and your partner is already out the door or you've been single throughout the pandemic and are now looking for a new match, consider skipping down to the question \"How do I date during this time?\" For others, whether you're too far apart or too close together right now, you may be missing your partner. Vanessa Marin, a relationship and sex therapist, has written several columns about maintaining your relationship. We've compiled some of her advice (and advice from others) to help your relationship survive the pandemic:\n1. Take care of yourself first. (And, no, that's not a selfish No. 1.) Being a better you will make you happier, as well as your significant other, because, newsflash: taking care of you is not the sole job of your partner. Right now, it's more important than ever to \"feel your feelings,\" writes Ms. Marin, adding that validating your emotions will help you move on more quickly. To get in touch with yourself, try meditating, journaling free form for five or 10 minutes a day and exercizing. Also, be sure to reach out to others beyond your partner. Remember those friends you used to get together with before the pandemic squeezed the normality out of life? Reach out to friends and family to see how they're doing and share what's going on in your own life, too. (Pro tip: If you're getting almost all of your social and emotional support from one person, you're not doing it right. It's not fair to expect or possible to deliver on taking care of each other's every need. Bottom line: It's just not healthy and you're building a foundation for certain disappointment.)\n2. If you live with others, consider the safety of everyone in your households and openly communicate with them to determine individual comfort levels before bringing your significant other back to that shared space. Then be sure to check-in frequently: With passing time and new strains of the virus cropping up, those comfort levels may be changing, and what people were good with in the summer could be very different from what they're OK with now.\n3. Make (and stick to) a plan. Discuss what each of you have to tackle (both longterm and over the course of the next week or so). Check in at an appointed time each week to recallibrate and nightly to tweak the day ahead. Right now, the pandemic has put only added pressure to a persistent disparity in the distribution of parental labor, with women carrying the brunt of added child care responsibilies (as well as disproportionate job loss) even beyond their majority share before the pandemic. That unequal division of parenting and household responsibilities, along with financial problems, and just too much arguing are among the top reasons couples separate or file for divorce, studies show. So be sure to divide the responsibilities, and if you're the kind of couple that gets joy (or at least a bit of peace) from a shared calendar, then go for it.\n4. Yep, you should still be checking in on each other. Whether you're living in different timezones or literally sitting next to your partner all day, every day, be sure to remember: Its not about grand gestures, its about doing small things often,\" says Logan Ury, the director of relationship science at the dating app Hinge. (And that goes for asking about the little things, too.) Some of us are experiencing ambiguous loss, said Sinead Smyth, a licensed marriage and family therapist, adding that some of us may not want to complain to our partners about these frustrations, but if you dont honestly share these feelings, you may start to lean away from each other, when you should be leaning closer. (At least metaphorically speaking.)\nIt might seem simple or even over-redundant, but you should still be asking the questions you (hopefully) were asking pre-pandemic: \"How was your day?\" \"How are you feeling?\" (Or, \"I notice you seem [insert emotion here], what's going on?\") \"What can I do to better support you through this?\" And while you're at it, say \"thank you\" and be specific: \"I really appreciate when you do [insert that great thing they do],\" or \"thank you for seeing I was losing it and stepping in with [insert that great save they made].\" The more you start spelling out what you're grateful for, the more you will find things to be grateful for. As for your partner: it never hurts to hear you're appreciated, and they might just return the favor. In the end, this time together could actually make you closer. (Take a look at the next question, too, for pointers about how to start a good conversation with your partner.)\n5. Mix some excitement into the relationship, suggests Jancee Dunn, a frequent NYT Parenting contributor and the author of How Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids.\" According to one experiment just 90 minutes of novel experience a week for a month can make for a more satisfactory relationship for months to come. Consider planning a future trip together (just maybe don't buy the tickets yet). Or start a new at-home hobby together (you don't even have to be good at it for it to still be fun and different). Pasta making, anyone?\n6. Create boundaries: they're a sign of love, too. How can you give each other space  when we all need a little more of that from the people we're now doing everything with? If you were both usually apart and at work before the pandemic, you probably didnt talk for 14 waking hours straight. (At least your boss hopes you didn't talk for 14 hours straight.) So now if you're sudden-cubicle buddies, build in that time apart, so that seeing each other is a nice break at the end of the day.\nIf you're both working from home, create separate work spaces. (If you can, close the door.) And to keep those dividers up, even consider texting during the work day as opposed to screaming into the other room. That way you can each respond when you have a moment. It's also nice to have peaceful alone time, and you can find creative ways to make that a part of your everyday routine. Maybe you devy up who gets up first to fix the coffee or wake the kids, while the other luxuriates in bed a little longer. (Then switch the next day.)\n7. Remember, this isn't actually the pandemic of 1918: We live in a technological world, so take advantage. Even if you're tired of video-chats, if you're separated from your partner, seeing each other's faces is an important way to stay connected. On Zoom you can even use the function to hide your own face making it seem more like an in-person conversation. (Plus, you shouldn't be staring at yourself anyway.)\nTo bind your lives together, what's known as \"interdependence\", try video-chating while cooking from the same recipe (in two separate kitchens), then get dressed up for a candle-lit dinner via laptop, or take your FaceTime chat outside and go for a walk together or cozy up on the sofa and pick a TV show to watch at the same time: one-two-three-play. (Texting and sending audio message reactions throughout can be fun, too.)\nEvidence suggests that your long-distanced relationship can work just as well as those close together. So if you're in a newly long-distanced relationship, consider some hilarious (and actually helpful) advice from Holly Burns, a writer in the San Francisco Bay area and the survivor of a long-distance relationship in the era of AOL Instant Messenger. (The highlights include a few mind-twisters: \"talk about when youre going to talk,\" \"be there even when you cant be there,\" and \"get awkward early,\" among others.) And Ms. Marin, the sex therapist, has a few more suggestions about how to keep your sex life alive (including the use of remote sex toys, which your partner can control from afar).\n8. But no matter what, prioritize quality time  it's more important than the quantity of it. Whether you're living together or rarely ever see each other these days, be intentional with the time you do have in-person, as well as virtually. Talk about the things you miss doing together and find ways to salvage old routines while creating new ones. Maybe that's rejuvenating your long-lost date nights, maybe that's starting them up for the first time. Consider among the options (side-by-side or via face-cam): cooking an elaborate meal or reading a book together  agreeing to a number of chapters a night or even reading aloud together. And in case you've forgotten how: Get dressed up for an evening in. Give your partner a massage. Pop open a nice bottle of champagne  OK, we'll leave the rest of the night up to you.\nRead More How to Help Your Relationship Survive a Lockdown\nYep, it's been a tough year for us single folks. (Me, too.) How many months has it been since you last had physical touch? I'm not even talking about sex; how about just a hug without fear that you might kill someone? Are we still counting the months? Have you broken the streak? And, no, your coupled friends absolutely do not understand. (And don't let them nod and smile and pretend they do.) Gagan Bhatnagar, 35, a clinical oncology consultant in London (yes, he's single), does understand, and you'll find other singles who do, as well, on his cry into the darkness on Twitter in December.\nAs the writer Megan Nolan points out, just because you hadn't found your perfect match by March 2020, doesn't mean you should be hung out to dry until whenever you happen to get vaccinated  nor should you feel shame in lamenting your loss (however you define it): \"There are not a finite number of ways to have felt pain,\" in this pandemic, she writes.\nAs if dating wasn't already hard enough, dating in a pandemic is that much harder  and, let's face it, even if you're not serious about the person, dating right now is a serious undertaking. Before we went by the adage that you are sleeping with every person your partner has ever slept with, but now, in a pandemic, you're hanging out with every person your partner has been near in the past 14 days. As such, if you are dating, you should be more transparent than you were before the pandemic about the social interactions you've had and the risks you've taken (including those outside your typical geographic space).\nOn the flip side, it's not healthy to be alone for too long, and one particularly disheartening study shows it can even increase the risk of premature death by 26 percent.\nBut before we get too dating-doomsday, Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist who has spent some four decades studying romantic love across the globe, offers some positive thoughts about dating during this time, including among them: spending and chitchatting less, while slowing down to have more real conversations before things get physical. Gone are the days (we hope, at least for now!) from before the pandemic, when some 34 percent of American singles had engaged in sex before an official first date. And now deep into the winter months, we're experiencing an >a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/style/cuffing-season.html\">elongated cuffing season, which has been going strong since the summer.\nReally getting to know one another, sharing our innermost feelings and life story, creates intimacy, love and, yes, even commitment. (By the way, men are equally likely to share their feelings as women.) And although romantic love may suddenly hit you over the face, those feelings of deep attachment take time  something many of us have a bit more of these days. In fact, the social psychologist Sara Konrath, Ph.D., says that \"somewhat ironically\" the pandemic is speeding up the slow dating movement.\nYou can start by getting to know each other over video-chat. To relax be sure to keep to your typical pre-date rituals: play that Beyonc song, sip that glass of wine, give yourself that mirror pep talk. And then, since they're getting a peep inside your home anyway, set up in a spot that may lead to meaningful conversation. (Not the one corner of your apartment that isn't covered in unfolded laundry  because obviously that's not really you.) Try for a space that will encourage questions and deeper (maybe even funny) stories that help you get to know each other: situate yourself by your favorite piece of artwork (and talk about how you bartered for it on a sidewalk in Santiago and somehow, against all odds, it survived international travel in your over-stuffed suitcase), or by that piece of furniture that (just barely) survived a house party with a bit too much mezcal, or (here's a novel idea): how about by your open fridge. ('Why, yes, I do have four types of hot sauce.') Or what about by that pile of books by the couch (a bookshelf works, too)  pick up a few and share what you're reading. Then ask them to share from their favorite corner  although if one of you opens your fridge, expect reciprocal action.\nAnd, unless you really do want to stare at yourself all night, be sure to hide your own face on Zoom, to make it seem more like the in-person dates of bygone days. For more ideas, here are six things you could consider for the first virtual date  from getting ready beforehand, to breaking the ice shortly after logging on, to deciding if you really want to see them again. (Speaking of which, if things go well, be sure to switch it up for future dates. You wouldn't go back to the same restaurant every time now, would you?)\nBut be aware: virtual dating does have its drawbacks; the chemistry you feel online may not result in sparks face-to-face. That's because you've gotten to know the person that they presented themselves as, not necessarily the person they prove to be, in, well, person. Yep, we're talking about that inexplicable vibe, built on that (yes, it's shallow) full-body view, hand gestures and our preferred distances from one another. On video chat, space is just an illusion; only in person do we have the chance to mediate boundaries and comfort zones. When we don't have that, we fill in the gaps with our imagination, painting a frog as a prince(ss), something a few of us are guilty of even in regular times.\nSo since taking it slow is both safer and statistically proved to cultivate a deeper relationship, if you decide to take the dive into the pandemic dating pool and see your date in RL, you might start with a socially distanced walk with masks. But no matter what, get to know them (ideally in an outside setting) before taking off each other's masks (or anything else you both so choose). The C.D.C. has a few guidelines for dating in person, too: Stay home if you feel sick, wear a mask in public, keep at least six feet from others and wash your hands after the date. Also, outdoor meetings are safer than indoors ones.\nAnd perhaps more important even than the date itself is the communication before and during your outing. You should be up front about your expectations and what precautions you plan to take  like if you're going to wear a mask or not. (Please, wear a mask, though.) You can try questions like: \"What does social distancing mean to you?\" or \"I'd like to meet up, but only if we wear masks and get tested first.\" You can also phrase any considerations you have (like the idea of holding hands or kissing during a date) as a hypothetical to take the forwardness out of the proposal (if forward isn't your style). And if you're uncomfortable asking, just say so: naming the feeling automatically diminishes it. You can (and should) also share upfront the risks you've taken and ask about the other's comfort level in social interactions and any intimacy that requires less than six feet of distance. (Of note: some dating apps do some of the work for you. Bumble, for instance, uses a badge system to note user's social distancing comfort levels on dates, while Lex, an app for the queer community, includes Covid-19 and antibody test results on profiles.)\nWhile on the date, be sure to verbalize any discomforts you have. Non-verbal cues (like turning away from your unmasked date) can signal disapproval, but in a time when issues of consent blatantly extend beyond the bedroom (what about hugging? removing your mask?), it's always best (and clearest) to use your words, especially when our masks cover much of our faces, literally masking our expressions. Remember: just because you like your date, doesn't mean he/ she/ they fall under what Marie Helweg-Larsen, a professor of psychology at Dickinson College, calls that supposed \"umbrella of invulnerability\" that we tend to assume of those we, well, like.\nNow, we do need human touch  it's a proven mood stabilizer, and if you're still counting that time a cashier accidentally grazed your hand while giving you change, you may be feeling anxious, even depressed right about now. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner for disease control at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, put it simply: \"Abstinence for the duration of the pandemic is not going to work.\"\nIn fact, the New York City health department has infamously provided a \"Safer Sex and Covid-19\" fact sheet with more-detailed and, shall we say, descriptive advice. These guidelines remind us: you are your safest sex partner,\" the next safest partner\" is someone in your household, and, of course, \"heavy breathing and panting can spread the virus further.\" A number of other public health agencies have offered tips for dating and sex during the pandemic,.\nOf course, if you are going to be physically intimate, youll need to have frank and honest conversations about your limits and your living situations. (Actually, while we're on the topic, that's a good conversation to have whether you're living in a pandemic or not.)\nRead More Your Corona-Dating Guidebook\nIf you are in immediate danger call 911. If you are not in immediate danger but living in a dangerous situation at home, call the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or text LOVEIS to 22522. Services are available in more than 200 languages. And if you belong to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community and are experiencing abuse or hate-based violence, call the Anti-Violence Project at 212-714-1141, which provides round-the-clock hotline help in English and Spanish.\nIf you are a child who is being hurt at home, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline: 1-800-4-A-CHILD (22-4453).\nBut please be careful when reaching out for help, especially if your partner, parents or caretaker monitors your phone and/or computer. If you fear being overheard, we have linked to the texting and chat tools for each website above. (Many local hotlines also have texting options.) Or ask a trusted friend to call for you. (Typically, that trusted person should not be related to your abuser.) Here you can search for domestic violence shelters by your zipcode. And this listing includes agencies by country in over 115 languages.\nAnd remember, if your abuser comes upon you while you're reviewing any website, you can hit the Escape button on your keyboard twice to exit immediately. (Many sites also have quick exits displayed when you visit.) No matter what, afterward, please clear your browser history and the phone number in your call log. (That includes clearing this question from your browser history.) Here's how to clear your history from any browser, and here's more on your digital security.\nIn the interim, if it's not possible to leave, try to make your home life as safe as possible. Think through your options: where is the safest place within your home? If an argument starts, where should you go? (For instance, you probably want to keep away from the kitchen where there might be knives, or the bathroom, which can also be quite dangerous.) Is it possible and safe for you to sleep in the car? These are questions you should brainstorm, if possible with that trusted friend.\nOf course, abuse extends well beyond physical and sexual violence and may include isolation from friends, family and employment, as well as constant surveillance; strict, detailed rules for behavior; and restricted access to basic necessities including food, clothing and sanitary facilities. It can be triggered by stress, which is now at an all-time high: many people are out of work or with less of it, concerned about money, struggling with alcohol, drug and other addictions and cooped up in small spaces with family even easier targets than usual amidst frequent lockdowns and quarantines. No matter what, our lives are more shuttered to the outside world than they were a year ago, further isolating families and shattering support networks like schools, workplaces and religious institutions, among others. Now spending more time than ever with their abusers, families often have a harder time reaching out for help  while facing an even more extreme version of the age-old problem: leaving the devil you know for an uncertain future (in this case, one filled with fears of contracting Covid-19).\nIts terrible for women who are living with their abusers right now, said one woman in Chicago who had left her abusive husband. Its hard to walk out during normal times. And these are anything but that.\nEven now, you are not alone. This is a problem affecting people around the world. If you are looking for services and resources in the United States check out the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence's compilation of organizations helping people who have been abused, which also lists specific resources for targeted sub-groups. (And if you yourself are struggling with coping mechanisms that have become addictions, you may want to check out some of our other questions including: \"How can I deal with the loneliness?\" and \"I am drinking a lot of alcohol. Should I be worried?\" If you need someone to talk to about issues like these, scroll up to: \"How do I find a therapist?\")\nEarly into the pandemic, reports at domestic violence hotline centers spiked in some places across the country, with calls and text messages mounting. But in other places and as time went on the calls tapered off  not because abuse has fallen but becuase those experiencing domestic violence have found it more and more difficult to distance themselves from their abusers and orders of protection have slogged through court systems operating below capacity. And along the same trend, reports of child abuse cases are also falling, which is worrisome.\nShut off from their typical daily reprieves at school and trapped in the hands of their abusers all day, children have even less agency than usual. Teachers are often the main reporters of suspected child abuse, but with many classes still virtual across the country, such small windows into the children's lives may not be cutting it. After all, people who abuse their families now have more control and supervision than before, making it easier for them to hide the mistreatment and harder for children to seek help. Additionally, it is nearly impossible for teachers to ensure their students are getting enough to eat or to suss out other forms of neglect or mental abuse that requires time, space and the trust that develops face-to-face. Earlier in the pandemic, the drop in reports was palpable, with cases dropping by 51 percent in New York City.\nThe pandemic has put in stark relief a rather consistent global failing to take care of those experiencing domestic violence, with countries' policies often falling like dominoes in the early onset of the pandemic. While such early missteps might be expected from some of the first countries ravaged by the virus, the fact that places like Britain, which ignored early warnings, were so under-prepared, lays bare a wider failing to take seriously and prioritize violence within the home. Meanwhile, the United States's mismatched patchwork of health policies made it difficult for service providers to adhere to changing guidelines while continuing to serve their clients.\nAnd none of this is surprising. The pandemic is just the latest in a series of crises that have shaken households, exacerbating the intensity and frequency of abuse cases, it also happened immediately after 9/11, with the economic downturn of 2008, and after both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.\nFor people concerned about a friend or family member who you believe to be mistreated, remember: you may not have success reaching out the first time. Oftentimes, the methods used to control partners and children bear an uncanny resemblance to those used by kidnappers against their hostages and repressive regimes against political prisoners, according to Judith Lewis Herman, a renowned trauma expert at Harvard University Medical School. Let the person know you're there and ready to talk whenever and wherever, keep reaching out and file reports if you witness or are told about the mistreatment. Those reports are anonymous and confidential.\nRead More What to Expect When You Call for Help\nIf you've noticed regressive behaviors in your kid, that's normal. If the kid has been acting out more, that's normal. And, yep, if the kid has been super happy at home, that's normal, too. Just like the rest of us, kids react to stress in different ways  the important thing is to be there for them.\nThe protections we get from positive relationships, along with sleep, exercise and a healthy diet are important for keeping those stressors in check. Parents: that mean's a lot of this is on you. (What isn't these days?) So you may want to check out the American Academy of Pediatrics's clinical interim guidance, released this fall, which walks parents through their role in supporting children through their emotional needs right now.\nLook out for these warning signs that your kid may be stressed out:\n-Has your young child lost skills she had already mastered? This is called regression, and it's normal for children to proceed, regress and proceed again; nothing in life is truly linear, but if it becomes a troublesome pattern, it could again indicate internalized stress.\n-Are your kid's eating habits changing? Is he eating more or less? Stress can affect the diet, and while it's totally normal for a kid to eat a lot one day and hardly anything another, watch these habits carefully to determine if such behavior appears normal or an indicator of something bigger.\n-The same goes for unhealthy sleeping patterns (sleeping too much or not enough).\n-What about trouble concentrating or a sudden uptick in headaches, stomachaches or muscle tension?\n-Has the kid turned the home into a zone of negativity? Perhaps you're hearing a lot of negative self-talk and general pessimism about others and their environment: \"I'm so stupid, you're so stupid, the world's so stupid,\" etc. Help your child reframe those thoughts in a more positive light  that will be important for how your kid tackles the day (or maybe just that tough homework assignment), as well as for the rest of the family. (Negativity is contagious, too.)\n-Has your teenager closed off (more than usual) about how they feel? Starting in middle school, some kids may begin hiding their concerns out of fear, shame or a sense of responsibility to avoid burdening others, according to the American Psychological Association.\n-Or has your teenager become more hostile and irritable (again, more than usual), withdrawn (more) from you or even from close friends? These can also be signs of stress.\nWhen talking to our kids, word choice is important, but it's not just about what you're telling your kids, it's also about how you're telling them. Children under the age of 5 need you to seem OK (even if you're not): what you say in answer to their questions is secondary to how you seem to think and feel about those words. That means prioritize the way you present the information (your demeanor, tone), because that may be more important even than the information itself. Naturally, it affects the way they process it. Try to avoid hyperbolic words and phrases with any child, but that's particularly important with our youngest children, who understand the world in magical terms (monsters under their beds and tooth fairies under their pillows) and even our kids through about age 10, who have started to understand logic, but not irony and sarcasm. At this age, they're worried not just about themselves but others, too, which can make this pandemic a lot scarier. Be sure to listen to their questions, explain things clearly and ask them what made them think or ask a certain question. It's important to understand the source and substance of the concern in order to effectively combat fear with knowledge. By age 11, your kid has probably begun to understand abstract thought, and as they progress through adolesence is also dealing with social and bodily changes that can be overwhelming separate from the pandemic. Be empathetic and remind them (if needed) why we're all having to give up so much right now.\nMadeline Levine, a clinical psychologist, reminds us: \"This is not the apocalypse. The crisis will pass. In the meantime we will have to teach our children how to deal with uncertainty. We dont have to love it. But we do have to model it.\" She has also offered tips about how to do that, tailored to your kid's age.\nAnd if you're stressed it's probably coming out in how you're reacting to and explaining the changing situation to your kids (not just your words, but your facial cues and body language, too). Give yourself grace and let yourself cut corners if you need to. It's really OK: no one's popping in to judge you, anyway. To the extent possible put a timer on your worries. Allow yourself maybe 30 minutes to really dwell and then after that 30 minutes, write them down to consider down the line. If that doesn't work, try keeping your worries at a distance for an hour at a time. Remember, worrying over the unknown is not in fact going to do anything to change it.\nIf you're part of a two-parent household, now is not the time to turn on your partner (even if you really do think they've totally lost it this time). Keep an open and non-judgemental dialogue about your own emotions. Starting sentences like: I need or I would feel better if, can help cue your partner to what will make you feel better. (Because, obviously, by that really stupid thing they just did, they haven't been getting it right so far.) And if you need a starting point for processing your own emotions, take a look at: Am I depressed? Or just in a bad mood?, \"Help! Im frustrated with my partner\" and \"How do I find a therapist?\" among others.\nWhen parents are stressed and worried, kids become stressed and worried, said Dr. Carol Weitzman, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician.\nEven our youngest children  as young as just 3 months  can tell when their parents are sad or angry  and can also feel those emotions. In fact, infants and toddlers are so aware of their parents's emotions (noting small changes in how they're held, facial expressions, tone of voice and changes in routine), that if you don't keep your own stress in check it's literally going to rub off on the baby.\nIf your child is worried about the pandemic, listen and validate those concerns. Don't shrug it off with a comment like Everything will be fine.\" Such dismissive reactions can make children feel like theyre not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota. Kids want to understand. (That's the why behind all those \"why's?\") Moreover, talking about the pandemic and its impact may help alleviate harmful stress.\nPlus, with understanding we all (kids included) start to see a way forward (and a light at the end of this long tunnel of unspecified length). To begin, focus on what's in our control, what we can do day to day to help others  like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when we go out. Just like the rest of us, kids like having a purpose and being a part of the solution.\nThere's another kind of talk  one you may have already experienced in the past year  which is even harder, but also crucially important. And that's talking about the grief we've all been experiencing in different ways. Maybe that's the death of a loved one, a divorce, the loss of Mom's job or the house, or even the smaller but still painful losses like missing senior year, prom, graduation ceremonies  or even one of those infrequent play dates. While those conversations will look quite different depending on the type of loss, and permanent changes (especially death) will require ongoing support and conversation, all of these losses (even the ones that may seem inconsequential in the long run) can hit hard these days. We've already lost so much in the past year  including our very sense of normal  and we've likely had fewer joys to look forward to and fill in the gaps. Now even the small things feel so much bigger. Just like the rest of us, your children need time, love, support, and, yes, even space to process these emotions. And even though it goes against every parental instinct you have to try to make things better, remember it's OK for things to not always be OK ... so long as we recognize those times and help each other through them.\nAlong with the talking, you should also build in some important structure to the days and months that still lie ahead. For kids who like structure, try to keep things as close to their \"normal\" schedule as possible, and even for those who take the day in stride, a little extra support can be helpful  in other words: lean into routine. (For a starting point, take a look at our questions: Help! I'm now both working and parenting from home. What should I do? and How can I keep my kid on track?)\nAnd don't forget to make sure your kids are getting interactions with other people to help keep their spirits up  whether that be virtually or through distanced or pod play dates. (Scroll down to \"What about socializing with other children? Can we do it safely?\" for some ideas about the best ways to go about this.)\nAll this is to say: No matter your child's age, check in on them. Even if they push you away, be that annoyingly persistent parent you promised you'd never become and keep knocking on that locked door. We all need someone to ask how we're doing now and again. Maybe you check in with everyone in the family around the table at dinner every Monday night. Maybe it's individual check-ins that aren't on a schedule. Whatever it looks like, just be sure they know you're their for them  always.\nRead More How to Keep Childrens Stress From Turning Into Trauma\nHere are a few tips to keep your kids engaged in the remote classroom. (Most of these ideas are good personal reminders for the working parent, too.):\n1. Dont let them study in bed: If your children arent asleep, they shouldnt be in bed. Instead, create a space with your children that fosters a good learning environment  one that separates work from the rest of life, says Donald M. Rattner, a New York-based architect who specializes in creating productive home and office spaces.\n2. Pick a space away from other distractions (like the television) and where they have room to move around. If you can position their desks by a window to let in natural light, thats even better. Create separate spaces with curtains, screens or an extra sheet. And let your children take some leadership in creating their spaces, adding artwork, fun pencils or a favorite photo. The in-home classroom should be a place where the kids want to be.\nJust be sure that the work space includes all of their necessary school supplies. (Nothing wastes time like walking all over the house in search of a sharpened pencil or that long-lost password to login.) In fact, depending on the age and needs of your child  as well as the layout of your home or apartment  you may set up offices as though your child is the co-worker in the next cubicle over.\nYou have an important work call, your child has a test or maybe one of you just needs a moments peace? Signal that. Color-coded cards (green for \"go,\" red for \"dont even think about it\") on the space dividers can signal when each of you can invade the others space.\n3. Set a strict routine. Just because youre not jumping out of bed and rushing to school every morning doesnt mean that some parts of that morning routine cant stay the same. Work on a schedule with your children  one that they are happy with and that works with your own schedule (you matter, too!).\nThen help them keep to it. Set a time to wake up, eat breakfast and, yes, change out of pajamas. And be sure to follow the same rules as the kids. No just-coffee-for-breakfast hypocrites in the house, please.\n4. Set daily goals. Sharing these goals with family members can give everyone ownership of their day and create self- and group-accountability, as well as compassion toward others in the house. If people are lagging behind, remind one another of your goals and see what you can do to meet them even after the inevitable hiccups in the day.\n5. Transitions are natural  just dont get caught up. You cant be productive every moment of the day. Kids need breaks (and so do you) for snacks, recess  and, yes, even naps!  to process the day. Build that into the routine.\n6. Get up and get moving. Take breaks to go outside, get some exercise or even just move around a bit inside the house.\n7. Remember to engage with your child. Theres a reason children are always asking Why? They, too, are invested in the meaning of what we do day in and day out. And some of that gets lost in a virtual environment. Try to connect their work to an everyday example in which youve used the material theyre learning.\n8. Keep in touch with the teachers. Just because you cant go to parent-teacher conferences right now doesnt mean you cant check in and voice concerns or ask for help. This is a school year for the record books. So have compassion for the teachers who are up against even more than usual. (And thats saying something.)\n9. Keep your distance, too. While younger kids need more help logging on and staying on  their fine motor skills arent fully developed yet  older kids dont need someone peering over their shoulder every few seconds. (And you have better ways to spend your time, too.) If your child needs help and youre equipped to provide it, then schedule some time outside of class to work together. And be sure to mark an end to the school day. In pre-Covid times, the school bus ride or walk home from school was a nice cue that the day was over  at least before the homework began. But now since all work is homework, when work is finished, find cues for both students and parents that the day is done: Close the computer, stop checking email  youre transitioning back into the life part of that work-life balance.\n10. Remember, tomorrow is a new day. You might not be trained as a teacher and probably never expected to be a full-time worker, caregiver and teacher all at once: Youll make mistakes and so will the kids. Give them grace. Give yourself grace. Give everyone grace again and again and again. You can work the kinks out with each new day.\nRead More Help! Im Working, Teaching and Still Doing All Those Other Parenting Things  But From Home\nFor most college students, it has been a rough last few semesters. But across the country, administrators were optimistic that the lessons learned at the start of the academic year would serve them well, enabling them to bring more students safely back to campus, through consistent testing, thorough contact tracing and, of course, requiring masks and social distancing.\nAs a result, the University of Michigan  which had 2,500 confirmed cases this fall, shifted to more remote class offerings in the spring, upped its testing, limited dorm room capacity to one occupant and set a no-tolerance policy for rule violations. Even still, students coming back to campus brought with them the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant. And from the start of the year through early February, the school has announced more than 1,000 new cases.\nAlthough the school was better prepared than in the fall: This is a variant that moves 50 percent faster than anything we had to deal with last semester, said Emily Toth Martin, an associate professor of epidemiology who devised the campus testing program.\nAnd since the spring semester started, other colleges across the country have also struggled with emerging variants, among them: the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Miami, Tulane and the University of California, Berkeley.\nEven before variants emerged in the United States at the end of the year and in January, by early December, The New York Times had already linked more than 397,000 cases and at least 90 deaths to campuses since the pandemic's start.\nAhead of the spring semester, the University of California, San Diego, planned to bring an additional 1,000 students to campus housing, the University of Florida to up the number of in-person classes offered and Princeton to increase its on-campus living student population to thousands of undergraduates from a few hundred. Almost two times the number of students would return to Harvard  and make that almost three times to Brown. And Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., wasn't just increasing the number of students on campus, it planned to reopen study abroad, too. (On the other side of the argument, California State Universitys 23 campuses planned to be mostly remote this spring.)\nFar from everyone was happy about the reopenings. Faculty members at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill voiced their concerns about in-person classes in an open letter: We have every reason to expect that the university will  once again  be overwhelmed by infections when classes resume, they wrote, asking the university to cancel most in-person classes in the spring.\nMore than 200 professors at the University of Florida asked for reprieves from teaching students face to face  less than half were given permission to do so.\nAnd State University of New York at Oneonta in upstate New York announced it would reopen for in-person classes in the spring  to a voluminous petition in protest. In the fall, the school, which suffered the worst outbreak of any public college in the state, had not mandated negative tests before students returned to campus (although many schools in the college system asked students for test results). That changed in the spring, and students have also been required to complete a daily health questionnaire for the 14 days before they came to campus and to quarantine for seven days before arriving. They are also subjected to weekly pooled surveillance testing.\nYes, money is, of course, a factor in the decision to bring students back. (Colleges make a lot, charging for room and board.) But actually, some studies suggest its not a bad approach because oftentimes cases arent traced back to in-person classes anyway  the biggest risk is the social activities college students like to engage in after class. In fact, a study of 70,000 undergraduates at Indiana University suggested that the more classes a student took in person, the lower the likelihood that student would become infected with Covid-19. But that was before the variants appeared on campus, which could affect how schools adjust going forward.\nOf course, not everyone will adjust the same. So far, colleges have adapted a patchwork of policies of varying strength and effectiveness to combat outbreaks on campus. At times the gaps have put students and faculty at risk. In fact, although the American College Health Association's guidelines suggest testing college students twice a week in order to detect asymptomatic infections, it is unknown how many colleges have gone ahead and adopted this research-backed approach.\nSeparately, college students are becoming frustrated with fees and loans that dont seem worth the virtual education. Students at the University of Georgia and at Georgia Tech are suing to get some of their tuition and fees back. Community colleges are enrolling fewer and fewer male students  especially among students of color. (Right now, you shouldn't have to pay anything toward your student loans  or accrue interest  through the end of September. And you won't need to pay income taxes on that forgiven debt, either for any debt forgiven from the start of this year through the end of 2025. For more info, see this Q. and A. with the Education Department.)\nIts not an easy time. Last year colleges asked Congress to pass a bill with $120 billion in relief for higher education. The third stimulus package puts almost $40 billion toward higher education.\nRead More Tracking the Coronavirus Across U.S. Campuses\nSchools should be the last to close and the first to reopen, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (But that hasn't happened anywhere.)\nAnd for no one is that more important than for our youngest students, because: 1. They really need that in-person instruction more than the older kids, and 2. Its safer for them to be in the classroom.\nIn February, the C.D.C. urged schools K-12 to reopen as soon as possible, while emphasizing the particular importance of getting younger children back in their desks. (The C.D.C. also said that vaccinating teachers should be a priority but not a prerequisite for reopening, which follows New York's statistics, as well.)\nC.D.C.s operational strategy is grounded in science and the best available evidence, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the C.D.C.\nYounger children  those under 10  are less likely to contract and transmit the virus, so they can enter the classroom at a much lower risk than older students.\nPlus, many health experts, say classrooms are rather safe, so long as schools enforce safety measures like mask wearing and social distancing.\nElementary students can safely receive at least some in-person learning in communities with high transmission rates, according to the C.D.C. And taking those children out of the classroom should only be in the most extreme circumstances (and even then, they should be on a hybrid model with some in-person instruction). Meanwhile, older students can safetly attend if their community has lower transmission rates, or if, amid higher rates, their schools enforce weekly testing of students and staff to weed out asymptomatic infections. But, the C.D.C. notes, those students may have to return to hybrid or remote learning in those cases, and at the highest transmission rates, these classrooms should shutter. (Additionally, the C.D.C. urged prioritizing in-person instruction over other school activities  like sports, clubs.)\nOf course, it's safest for everyone if local governments do the work to tamp down their numbers  and parents might also be more comfortable sending their kids back. But across the country, city and state governments have prioritized the openings of nonessential businesses and other quickie-economic fixes over getting kids back in the classroom. And although the C.D.C.'s guidance is rooted in science, it has no enforcement mechanism.\nSadly, that means that while the agency is pushing for the reopening of schools, its own criteria would keep more than 90 percent of U.S. counties from full-time classroom teaching, according to Dr. Walensky's own figures.\nThe good news: Most public school districts across the country are providing at least some face-to-face teaching, although only about half of the country's students are learning in the classroom. The bad news: Poor students of color in urban districts are less likely to get that face time  often, their schools are still closed.\nWhen many elementary students in New York City started back Dec. 7, they returned to classrooms with even more health precautions: random weekly testing and 10-day closures for every two unrelated positive cases detected in the school. (Individual classrooms also shutter with the detection of a single case.) As a result, between Jan. 4 and Feb. 10, more than half of the 1,052 open school buildings had been closed for up to two weeks, while less than 400 had not had to close at all in the new year.\nIn February, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that about 62,000 New York City middle school students (those who last year opted for in-person learning) will return to the classroom for at least part of the week beginning Feb. 25  the first time since November. (The two-case rule is not likely to change before they do.)\nMr. de Blasio also wants to reopen high schools this spring, too  but they're a complex situation, he said.\nAnd aross the country, school districts have turned to New York, the nation's largest district, which has been leading the pack in reopening to determine the best course of action. Even so, by the time elementary students started back in New York, those in Michigan, Cambridge, Mass., and Johnson County, Kan., were already in class.\nRead More Say Goodbye to Your Elementary Students, Class Is (Finally!!) Back in Session\nOver all, our excercise habits have changed considerably during the course of the pandemic. A study from the U.K., which had not been peer-reviewed, showed than many of us have been less active since the start of lockdowns, although some people have really upped their routines  and many of those people are over 65. No matter where you are on that scale, it's never too late to get started.\nLet's just get this out of the way up front: If you are healthy and do not have a breathing ailment, then, no, wearing a mask should not affect your ability to workout, and, yes, you should be wearing one  still.\nTwo studies  one published out of Israel and the other out of Canada  and both focused on cycling, find that masks don't negatively affect vigorous workout routines. People's heart rate and respiration changed negligibly. (That's right, it's in your head.) And, no, it doesn't matter what your mask is made of.\nFrom the results of our study, I dont think masks are likely to make workouts feel worse, said Philip Chilibeck, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who oversaw the Canadian study.\nThat said, wearing a mask can take some getting used to, so you might want to take it slower while you figure it out. (The studies showed that after a period of acclimation, you'd feel like the workout was essentially the same level of difficulty as without a mask.) But you should find the mask that feels best while working out (and it might not be the one you use to walk the dog). Also, an N-95 mask isn't suggested, as it ups your carbon dioxide levels.\nNow, if youve had Covid-19, expect a long recovery, and please take your time returning to exercise.\nEven if you were an athlete beforehand, you are not going to be back at your peak capacity for a while. And the usual return-to-play criteria for sick athletes do not apply, said Dr. James Hull, a sports pulmonologist at Royal Brompton Hospital in London.\nWe have seen people have some mild symptoms to start with and seem to improve,\" he said, only to then deteriorate really badly at seven days following their first symptoms.\"\nAnd no matter what, most everyone took some time off their normal workout routine in the early part of the lockdown, and many have struggled to hit stride with a routine that fits this new pandemic world. In other words, a lot of people are a lot less toned than they used to be.\nIf you are one of those people, start slow. Even just taking an \"awe walk\"  conscientiously noting the beauty all around you (at whatever pace feels comfortable) will make you feel happier and more rejuvenated than if you, well, didn't.\nFocus first on strength, rather than cardio, because inactivity eats away at muscle mass. But take your time as you return to weight training, said Brad Schoenfeld, an associate professor of exercise science at Lehman College in New York, who researches resistance exercise. If you have been doing almost no training,\" he said, plan to start at 50 percent of the volume and intensity of your prior workouts\" when you return to the barbells. (And if you plan to head back to the gym, be sure to check out our question \"How about gyms?\" for safety tips.)\nAs you get back into your routine, you can add in cardio. But remember, even if youre running outside, wear a mask. Youre breathing heavily, and you could be spitting out  or sucking in  virus droplets. (I know, yuck, right?) And while you might not be hitting the same mileage as before (or you may be a little slower), that's okay. You'll get it back ... one step at a time.\nRead More Your First Workout Challenge\nPresident Biden says his $1.9 trillion relief plan is paramount to keep people in their homes rather than being thrown out in the street.\nThe third stimulus package puts almost $22 billion toward emergency rental assistance. And that money can be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses. Lower income families who have been without work for at least three months are prioritized. (See the question above for more specifics and to see if you qualify.)\nMoreover, President Biden extended the federal eviction moratorium through March 31. Congress also put $25 billion toward rental assistance.\nBut even still, tens of millions of people owing backrent may be uprooted anyway  the countrys data on evictions is so incomplete that city and state governments now with money to give away dont know who is at risk of eviction and homelessness or how to get the money to those people.\nMost renters in this country live in private rentals, their income just above public housing thresholds or their immigration status barring them from other options, and the U.S. holds almost no data on this vast majority. In fact, according to one study, one third of U.S. counties have no idea how many people are evicted from their area each year.\nAnd so, against the backdrop of a federal moratorium and other state moratoriums, thousands of evictions (illegal and suspect) are currently forcing people from their homes, but without a federal database, such removals cannot be tracked or halted.\nPresident Biden has said that housing is a right in America. But referring to the two-month extension on the moratorium, Eva Rosen, author of The Voucher Promise: Section 8 and the Fate of an American Neighborhood writes: While this temporary measure is a necessary Band-Aid on a gaping economic wound, housing is not yet a right in this country  far from it.\nIf your landlord is pressuring you to leave, be sure you know your rights (they vary widely by state). Also, be sure to take a look at the National Low Income Housings federal eviction moratorium lookup tool to determine if your address falls under any of the federal eviction bans. And for more information on those bans, check out these detailed explanations from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which also provides this guidance for renters who need help.\nCheck out low or no-cost legal assistance through Legal Services Corporations map, as well as Just Shelter, a tenant advocacy groups website on local organizations helping tenants in need, and Eviction Labs list of local and regional actions to halt evictions. (The research team out of Princeton University has developed the first national database of evictions and is also tracking evictions in real time across five states and 19 other cities, enabling them to determine if such moratoriums are working effectively.)\nDepending on where you live, you may have several avenues to pursue before youre kicked out.\nCities like Philadelphia and Los Angeles are shifting to cash assistance programs. Moreover, the California Legislature recently passed a bill extending the states eviction moratorium and allowing renters to apply for assistance without formal leases (you can use documents like bills and school registrations instead). California will also put as much as $2.6 billion in federal rental aid toward clearing arrears.\nMeanwhile, New Yorkers unable to pay rent are now also temporarily protected under a new state law, which will halt almost all evictions for at least 60 days, even those where the leases have expired. Additionally, tenants who sign documentation saying they have been adversely affected by the pandemic can lengthen those protections until May 1.\nOf course, renters arent the only ones suffering. Mom and Pop landlords are struggling, too  and with far fewer reprieves and little relief under New Yorks recently passed law. (The law does however keep lenders from foreclosing on property owners with no more than 10 units until May 1  again, if they are adversely affected by Covid. Even still, however, they must pay mortgage, taxes, water and heating bills.)\nAlthough renters and small landlords may find themselves at odds against each other, they are actually in a similar predicament right now. If you find yourselves on either side of this problem, try to talk to one another  respectfully.\nTenants, let your landlord know where youre at. If your landlord has a heart (and some actually do), they will appreciate knowing why it is you cant pay (even if they keep pressing): let them know if youve lost your job or wages or have had a health or family emergency that has depleted your funds. Tell them you understand they may be struggling, too, and that you want to work out a payment plan that works for both of you.\nSmall landlords, approach your tenants and ask for their backstory. Why cant they pay? Are there some fixes they may not be aware of? (Remind them about unemployment benefits and other assistance, which can help bridge the gaps.) If youre in the position to do so, you can offer them the option of paying a reduced rent and waive part or all of the arrears or put them on a payment plan that reduces what they pay now but still requires them to pay you in full later. Or you can offer to pay them to move out by your chosen date, although depending on how you file the paperwork, they may have difficulty finding another place.\nYou can, of course, bring a case against your tenant, which will damage their credit (and future building owners can sue them anyway, even if you turn the other cheek), but David Skaller, a litigator and partner at the Manhattan law firm Belkin Burden Goldman, says that by holding off, you can actually strengthen your argument. Suggest the credit-ruining, burdensome court process as your final resort and try to broker a payment plan instead. (While New Yorks legislation delays evictions, it does not cancel back rent, so for renters its nice to get ahead of it as much as they can, and for landlords some money in the pocket is still better than none.)\nThe pandemic has not caused housing instability  but its made it far worse. Even before the pandemic, about 11 million households  or a quarter of all renters in the U.S.  were spending more than half of their total income on housing. Meanwhile, overcrowding ticked up. Now, renters across the country already owed $53 billion in arrears, utilities and late fees as of January, according to data collected by Moodys Analytics, which considers all delinquent renters.\nFor families falling behind and noting increasing concern about hitting next months rent, that often means curbing groceries and other necessities just to pay the bills.\nOftentimes, to offset housing costs, families are moving in together, squeezing into too-small spaces, while taking on the added risk of infection by enlarging their household capacity. (Additionally, studies show such living arrangements create additional problems within the household, including diminished long-term health and education achievement  further exacerbating the socio-economic and racial disparities that this pandemic has brought burbling to the surface.)\nThe good news is that there may be more help on the way. President Biden campaigned on a platform of universal housing vouchers which could provide stable housing to many more Americans  although as the current voucher system works, where landlords often decline to accept the vouchers anyway, many who receive help cant use it and those who do use it often end up in neighborhoods segregated by race. The system would have to be overhauled first.\nConor Dougherty is a Times reporter who covers housing and business. Housing should be an investment in people, he said in an edited interview. It shouldnt be an investment in structure. When we think of housing as a necessity, we think about shelter in the way we think about food, but when we think of it as an investment, we lose sight of its role in health care and in family security. We would do well to start asking ourselves more frequently, What is the point of having a home? To live in it.\nRead More How to Prevent My Own Eviction\nWell start with the good news. Buying insurance through the federal program called COBRA will be a lot cheaper  for a little while. Often, recently unemployed people are faced with the option of keeping the insurance they had while employed  only if they can shell out large wads of money to keep it. Under COBRA, someone may have to pay even more than the full cost of the premium: at least 102 percent of it. But now, if youve lost your job or had your hours cut, the government will cover the entire cost of your premium from April 1 through Sept. 30.\nAnd since private health insurance companies will receive government funds to cover recently laid-off workers, as well as those who buy their own coverage, several million more people are anticipated to gain private insurance coverage.\nHowever, the bill wont help everybody. If you qualified for new, employer-based health insurance elsewhere before Sept. 30, you will no longer be eligible for that no-cost coverage. And if you left your job voluntarily, as many working mothers have, you wont be eligible, either.\nIf you find yourself once again on newly shaky ground, youre not alone. More American workers lost their health insurance because of job loss in a three-month stretch at the pandemics start than ever before over an entire year  about 5.4 million people from February to May 2020, according to one study by the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families USA. And that estimate grows when you take family members into consideration: In early May 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation expected that even more people may lose their health insurance as companies lay off workers and cut benefits.\nIf youve lost your job (and with it your",

It was introduced yesterday [Friday] and today we have come to get the receipts for this petition.\"\nSpeaking earlier to BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane, Mr Fayulu said: \"I will do whatever is possible for me to do to get the truth because the Congolese want change.\"\nOn Saturday, Mr Fayulu repeated that the result did not reflect \"the truth of the ballot boxes\".\nThe electoral commission also said the pro-Kabila coalition had won a majority of parliamentary seats.\nSeveral Western governments and the influential Roman Catholic Church in DR Congo have expressed surprise and concern at the declared results.\nMr Kabila has been in office for 18 years and the result, if confirmed, would create the first orderly transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.\nWhat does Fayulu say?\nDozens of Fayulu supporters had gathered outside his residence in the capital, Kinshasa, to chant slogans against Mr Kabila and Mr Tshisekedi.\nHowever they fled inside the building when the security forces arrived on Saturday, Reuters news agency reports.\nMr Fayulu admitted his court challenge would have little chance of success as the constitutional court was \"composed of Kabila's people\" but he said he did not want to give his opponents any chance to say he had not followed the law.\n\"Felix Tshisekedi has been nominated by Mr Kabila to perpetuate the Kabila regime. Because today the boss is Kabila,\" Mr Fayulu said.\n\"Mr Kabila cannot stay and make an arrangement with someone who will not have any power... Mr Tshisekedi knows himself that he did not win.\"\nMr Fayulu said he feared there would be violence if the electoral commission did not give the true figures \"polling station by polling station\" and that it was the right of all Congolese to demonstrate according to the law.\nHas there been any violence?\nThousands of supporters of Mr Tshisekedi took to the streets to celebrate but those who backed Mr Fayulu also came out in protest.\nViolent scenes were reported in Kikwit, where at least two policemen and two civilians were said to have been killed.\nThere were reports of several hundred students protesting against the result and being dispersed by tear gas in the town of Mbandaka.\nProtests were also reported in Kisangani but the south, where Mr Tshisekedi has broad support, was mainly celebrating.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all sides \"to refrain from violence\" and widespread unrest has not yet been reported.\nWhat was the result of the election?\nAccording to the National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Mr Tshisekedi received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election.\nThe full results were:\nFelix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes\nMartin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes\nEmmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes\nTurnout was reported to be 48%.\nWhat could happen next?\nCandidates must file any appeal to the constitutional court within 48 hours of the announcement of the provisional results.\nJudges will then have seven days to deliberate.\nConstitutional expert Jacques Ndjoli told the BBC there were three possible outcomes: the court could confirm Mr Tshisekedi's victory, order a recount, or cancel the results altogether and call fresh elections.",

So it was all the more striking that, at the Democrats jamboree in Chicago in August, Barack Obama chose to put party aside for a moment and address the whole country: Our politics have become so polarised these days, the former president said, that all of us across the political spectrum seem so quick to assume the worst in others unless they agree with us on every single issue. As delegates waved their banners, he launched an impassioned appeal for Americans from both sides to stop the rot. The vast majority of us do not want to live in a country thats bitter and divided, he said. We want something better. We want to be better.\nNegative partisanship is the dry academic term for the fraught, emotional and damaging phenomenon that Mr Obama describes afflicting American politics. It is the inclination of people to vote not for a party in which they believe, but against another one that they fear or despise. This way of doing politics has seen a marked rise in democracies around the world since the end of the cold war, a rise that has accelerated noticeably over the past decade. It is a bad thing.\nThe politics of being anti is a tactic. It is not focused on a set of issues, nor does it draw on a political philosophy. It is available to the right and left alike: although the right may be more susceptible to it, it can frequently be used to the benefit of the left. Mainstream voters feel hostility to the extreme right more often than to the extreme left.\nCampaign managers of all stripes are more than happy to make use of anti-politics when they think it will give them an edge. If you are a lukewarm Republican but you hate Democrats for the threat they pose to the republic; if you were a Remainer so incensed by stupid Brexiteers that you could not accept their referendum victory; or if you hold Donald Tusk in contempt for sucking up to Germany instead of standing up for Poland, the chances are you have been on the receiving end of a successful negative campaign.\nThe electoral benefits of encouraging the anti- more than the pro- are obvious. Anger stirs people and gets them involved. It is often easier to gin up contempt than enthusiasm. If that riles supporters of the other party, so be it. Motivating your own voters to turn out is easier than persuading the other lot to switch sides. Hatred also creates useful elbow room for policy. Because it makes voters care about party-political outcomes more than anything else, they are sometimes willing to support plans that cut against their interests merely for the satisfaction of seeing their enemies suffer.\nBut a magic potion for elections can be a poison for democracyand America is a good example of a place that is suffering its ill effects. Before this years election campaign, Americans were asked by the Pew Research Centre, a polling organisation, for a word that describes their countrys politics; 79% of them used terms like divided or corrupt. Only 2% had something good to say. Roughly 90% of them were exhausted and angry; less than half were hopeful. It is hard to see how the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump has done anything to cheer them up. Speaking to Pew this month, four-fifths of respondents said it had not made them proud of America.\nThe noes have it\nSentiment towards political parties\nElection years in 50 countries, 10=most positive\nSize=population\nPopulation-weighted trend\n0 2 4 6 8 10 1960 70 80 90 2000 10 20 Own party sentiment Other parties sentiment\nGap in sentiment, relative to overall country average\n-2 -1 0 1 2 1960 70 80 90 2000 10 20 Britain United States\nPolities cannot sustain such cynicism without suffering grave harm. According to polling last year, almost two-thirds of Americans have little or no confidence in their political system. A bit less than a third have no confidence in either party. If politics is not working, then angry people are more likely to resort to violence, as they did against police officers after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and against elected politicians in the storming of the Capitol six months later. A survey by the University of Chicago in January found that 12% of Democrats, 15% of independents and 19% of Republicans agree that the use of force is justified to ensure members of Congress and other government officials do the right thing.\nGiven its baleful fruits, why then has negative partisanship spread? Because it works is too simple an answer. Politicians have been denigrating their opponents ever since Cleon slandered Pericles in ancient Athens. So long as candidates can exploit atavistic fear and suspicion to trigger hostility towards the other side, they always will. For partisan animosity to be growing today, something must be making the benefits higher or the costs lower.\nThe grievance culture has many explanations, including the professionalism of todays political campaigning and the fragmentation and consequent partisanship of the media market. But something deeper has changed, too. This essay is about what that something might be, and what politicians can do about it.\nMost academic studies of negative partisanship look only at the United States. But, although America has caught a pernicious case of anti-politics, it is far from unique. Focusing on America alone conflates what is fundamental across democracies with what is particularfor instance, the effect of American states and counties sorting into monocultural Republican and Democratic strongholds. Besides, in the heat of the contest between Ms Harris and Mr Trump, it is hard to stand far enough back to get a dispassionate view of how campaign managers use anti-politics to manipulate voters emotionsbecause everyone is already so wrapped up in their own.\nTo understand the deeper reasons for the worsening politics of antipathyand perhaps, thereby, to see ways to make things betterThe Economist has taken a broader view. We have put together what we believe is the biggest-ever dataset of voters feelings about the parties they support and oppose by tracking 274 elections in 50 democracies, ranging from West Germany in 1961 to the Netherlands in 2021.\nCollected with the help of Diego Garzia and Frederico Ferreira da Silva, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, the data come from surveys in which voters say how warmly they feel towards their own party and towards other parties on a scale of zero to ten. When there is more than one other party, we have taken the average. Our analysis ends in 2021 because some countries keep election-survey results under wraps for several years and we did not want the most recent data to be based on a different underlying sample. In any case, 60 years of data should be enough to uncover what is going on (our data and code can be found on GitHub).\nThe chart above shows the warmth of voters feelings towards their own party at the top and towards other parties in the middle. Over the first 20 years people felt warmer about both the party they voted for and the other lot. Around 1980 they started to cool on both groups. The affection for the party they voted for fell slowly, but for other parties it collapsed.\nThe red line at the bottom shows the gap between voters feelings about the party they voted for and the others they could have voted for; it plots changes country by country with respect to each countrys long-term average, then produces an average for the whole set. This is the line which tracks the growth of negative partisanship. Within its rise there are three distinct periods: after 1990, after 2008 and after 2016.\nOur charts are weighted by population, so the growth of anti-politics in the United States accounts for a significant amount of this extra ill-feeling, especially recently. But the trend is broader than that. The increase in negative partisanship can be seen even if America, or for that matter the entire Anglosphere, is excluded from the analysis. It is seen in two-party, first-past-the-post systems and in those where representation is meted out proportionally across a plethora of parties. The chart shows how negative partisanship has worsened in countries of all sorts. You might say that democratic politics is infected not by animosity so much as by panimosity.\nWe looked into these trends by collecting data on factors that academics and others have suggested might be causes of negative partisanship. We could show only correlations, not causation. But absent correlations can cast serious doubt on stories about causation, and a lot of correlations people might have expected did not turn up.\nYou might, for example, expect people in countries where ideological differences are growing to become steadily angrier with the other side, but if anything the reverse was true. Influxes of refugees do not seem to spread animosity; a culture of respect for political opponents and their arguments does not appear to moderate it; booming economies were no less divided than stagnating ones.\nWhat of the correlations we did find? One is with the perceived threat of war. The idea that unity frays without an external aggressor has a long pedigree. Sallust, a Roman politician and historian of the first century bc, traced the internecine turmoil that eventually led to Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon to the fall of Carthage almost a century earlier. Depriving Rome of its main rival, he argued, robbed it of the common purpose it needed to remain a republic.\nOur measures of external threat included military spending, the frequency of deadly military clashes and armed stand-offs, and survey data on the fear of wars. In each case, voters feelings about other parties were less negative when they were more anxious about war. We also found that more military spending in a country was correlated with less partisan animosity. The exception is military spending by America, which since the turn of the century has spent a lot of time and money fighting abroad in the absence of any existential threat to those at home.\nThe other broad correlation (see chart below) is with a set of beliefs about politics itself. When voters believe that politics creates economic and social gains in which everyone can share, regardless of their party, they feel more warmly towards the other side. By contrast, when they see politics as a fight over a limited set of resources, they are susceptible to campaigns that set them against each other.\nWhen people think their government is effective they tend to feel better about politicians. Likewise, if they expect to thrive in the coming years and if they feel good about their lives then they tend to look on political parties more sympathetically. In all these cases, the improvement in voters sentiment is greater towards rival parties than their own.\nAnother indication of whether people see a future in a country is whether they stay there. Many factors affect migration, but the correlation with negative partisanship is nevertheless striking, whether you are comparing one country with another or looking at a single country over time.\nAll this helps explain why negative partisanship often seems to begin with the rights ill feelings towards the left. By and large, the right is inherently more sceptical about the good works of government. It is also more likely to see society in terms of competing groups. If the right is quicker to attack this way, though, the left is inclined to respond by disqualifying its critics views as bigoted, immoral and fundamentally illegitimate. Thus tit begets tat.\nOur analysis may also explain those three steep declines in affection for other parties, after 1990, 2008 and 2016. The first coincides with the end of the cold war. If not quite the end of history, it was for many the collapse of a hostile ideological rival to capitalism and, in several countries, an end to the menace of a Soviet attack. Because our data end in 2021, we cannot tell whether Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw that effect reversed in neighbouring countries, with factions putting aside their differences to work together to protect the state they all depend on.\nThe second decline is suggestively close to the economic shocks that followed the global financial crisis of 2007-08. In its aftermath government could be portrayed as too incompetent for politics to be a great source of prosperity. In newly austere times, money was short and politics became a fight over who would get how much. In bank bail-outs, whatever their theoretical merits, the elites seemed to be grabbing vast sums for themselves at everyone elses expense. The crisis shunted politics onto a new trajectory. Working amicably with your opponents was for suckers; it made more sense to elbow them out of the way.\nWhat about the third decline, after 2016? Here we can find no obvious trigger. But that absence raises an alarming possibility. In a series of votes around that time, including the contest between Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton the tactic of negative partisanship was taken to new extremes. Those contests saw the harnessing of widespread anti-elite feeling by means of a new populism on the right. In some places the left responded in polarising kind. The electoral tactic of being anti- became the defining strategy of politicsand government.\nNegative partisanship is not simply unseemly; it can drive politics into a downward spiral. In a healthy system everybody has something to gain from working together. Government presents a whole landscape of possibilities, some of which can appeal to factions in rival parties. The anti-politics of negative partisanship collapses this into a one-dimensional, zero-sum spectrum between us and them.\nWhen the pursuit of power dominates the use of power, it sabotages the mechanisms which produce efficient government. Government requires compromise. However, legislators struggle to work across the aisle, because only a sell-out would give ground to the wicked people on the other side. Compromise requires debate. Yet, the media, whose business thrives on conflict, rumour, caricatures and conspiracies, gleefully orchestrates a shouting-match. Debate requires facts. But politicians seeking to demonise their opponents strain and break the bounds of truth, denouncing the other sides corruption, extremism or treachery. Facing the facts requires leadership. But bad candidates thrive because voters riled up by the supposed monsters on the other side are more willing to overlook their own champions flaws.\nWhen government becomes dysfunctional, partisans prosper. As our data show, that is because the country more closely resembles a one-dimensional, zero-sum place that rewards negative partisanship as an electoral tactic.\nTo see this destructive feedback-loop in action, consider three examples. In Britain politicians inflamed by the bitterness and contempt which characterised the Brexit referendum campaign were unable to agree on a policy for leaving the EU. In Poland hatred between the two main parties created a pretext for the government to capture the institutions that sustain the impartial rule of law. In America the presidential campaign of 2004 saw a ruthless initiative to invert the facts about a candidates war record rewarded at the ballot box, setting a dire precedent.\nThe Brexit referendum in June 2016 was marked by contempt on both sidesone lot sneered at the cosmopolitan elite, the other looked down at nationalist bigots. However, Brexit was unusual because it produced an outcome that required activists to stop their negative campaigning and come up with practical policies. In this it was like the American Supreme Courts judgment overturning the right to abortion established by Roe v Wade. Euroscepticism and pro-life politics were great motivators. But when the dogs caught the cars, people who knew with searing conviction what they were against suddenly had to say what they were for. And they were flummoxed.\nLeavers were wholly unprepared for a highly technical debate on how to negotiate Britains departure. Should Brexit be hard or soft? Should Britain aim to become like Norway or Switzerland, which are close to the EU in some ways, but not others? Or should it quit the EU without any deal at all? Chaos ensued. Because leavers could not agree on what they wanted, Britain had no coherent position in talks with the EU. Parliament was deadlocked as Conservative MPs, giddy with resistance, rebelled against their own government.\nIn a healthy polity, British politicians would have come together to work out which Brexit would best meet the many interests in play. For some Brexiteers, though, the hardness of the deal became a purity test instead of a question of practical politics. Remainers, including The Economist, filled the vacuum with passionate calls for a confirmatory referendum, fuelling a betrayal narrative according to which true Brexit was being sabotaged by deep-state Remainers. Brexit and its aftermath did grave damage to Britons faith in their politicians competence.\nBrexit stretched and twisted Britains poorly codified constitution. Traditions, norms and institutions are normally accepted as good ways to rein in the passions. However, if politicians can convince their supporters that the character of their opponents imperils the nation, they can frame the breaking of norms and stretching of rules not as constitutional vandalism, but as courage and strong leadership.\nThe most dramatic recent example of this was Mr Trumps attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after the election of 2020. A more gradual erosion took place in Warsaw where, over the course of the past two decades, a pair of gifted post-communist politicians firmly put the Pole into polarisation.\nDonald Tusk, who dominates Civic Platform, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who dominates Law and Justice (PiS), started their political lives fighting side by side against communism. In 2005 the two parties almost went into coalition government together. Ever since, each has demonised the other, particularly after Mr Kaczynskis twin brother, Lech, was killed when an aeroplane carrying him crashed on April 10th 2010. That disaster gave rise to conspiracy theories about Mr Tusk collaborating with the Russian government to suppress the details of what really happened on that foggy morning outside Smolensk.\nMost political scientists think that polarisation in Poland began as a way for two similar post-communist parties to differentiate themselves. To appeal to voters outside the big cities, who felt that they did badly after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, PiS said that Civic Platform was godless, globalist and selling Poland out to cosmopolitan elites. For its part, Civic Platform looked down on PiS voters as reactionary and unsophisticated. The tactics hardened into competing identities, and those identities fuelled a bitter struggle for power that began to wreck Polands vulnerable young institutions.\nOne former minister describes the business model this way: you need fear to motivate your basegive Tusk horns; make him out to be the devil or Satan or a Nazi. That wins you an election. But it is not in itself a firm base for long-term power. Unlike policies that can be built on, fear is a wasting asset that needs to be replenished, which is hard work. The best guarantee for staying in power is to use any time you get in office to capture the countrys institutions.\nUnder Mr Kacynski, PiS increasingly ran state-owned companies and the media as if they were extensions of the party. It also entered into a drawn-out conflict with the EU about the replacement of senior Polish judges. PiS insisted that, because the judges appointed their own successors, the judiciary had never been properly purged of its communist past. Its opponents accused PiS of another partisan takeover. They say that if, having won elections in 2015 and 2019, the party had won a third term in 2023, it would have established such a grip on Polands institutions that it would have been hard to eject from officemuch like Fidesz, Viktor Orbans party, in Hungary.\nA third way in which anti-politics feeds on itself is by eroding truth. In Poland the idea that Mr Tusk connived in the Smolensk air crash did not have to be true for it to plant the suspicion that he was not a true patriot. With Brexit, the Leavers claim that EU membership would lead to huge numbers of Turks moving to Britain was nonsense, and they knew it. But it helped them by turning the spotlight onto immigration. You might have thought that liars would be punished for stretching the truth. But when politics is consumed by hatred and contempt, lying is part of the thrill.\nSocial media are a vehicle for all this lying, but they did not create it. An early, and particularly consequential, example came in the presidential campaign of 2004, when John Kerry ran against George W. Bush. Mr Kerry made a lot of his status as a war hero. His three Purple Hearts could quiet those who labelled him a flip-flopper, wrote Mitch Reyes, of Lewis & Clark College in Oregon, in an analysis published a couple of years later. His Silver Star could quell criticism of his national-security record.\nThe Swift Boat Veterans for Truth had other ideas. They were a group of around 200 who had been in Vietnam, a few of whom said they had fought alongside Mr Kerry. Shortly after the Democratic convention (at which Mr Kerry had saluted the crowds, saying that he was reporting for duty), they claimed that he had not won his medals fairly, disputed his version of the past and accused him of being dishonourable and untrustworthy. The Swiftvets followed with an advert and a book, pouring scorn on Mr Kerrys stolen valour. Within weeks, his lead over Mr Bush had evaporated. He went on to lose the election.\nThe Swiftvets claims were untrue. Many of them had not fought alongside Mr Kerry. His campaign produced convincing evidence that some of the vets had praised his character before he was the Democratic nominee, and of soldiers who backed his version of what had happened in Vietnam. A naval investigator confirmed in early September, two months before the election, that his medals had been awarded correctly.\nNone of that repaired the damage. What an anonymous Bush adviser witheringly called the reality-based community did not have an adequate rebuttal to the allegations. In its absence, the officials claim to the New York Times that We create our own reality was borne out. The created reality was that Mr Kerrys experience in Vietnam did not qualify him to be Americas commander-in-chief. One of the architects of the Swiftvets messages was Chris LaCivita, who is now joint manager of Mr Trumps campaign.\nDoes this anti-ratchet doom democracy? Not necessarily. Our data show that in some places anti-politics has ebbed. It fell away in South Korea from 2004 to the election in 2016 (we have no data beyond that); in Chile from the late 1990s to around 2020; in the Czech Republic from 1996 to 2013 and in Switzerland from the early 2000s to the election in 2015. In other places, including Taiwan, Iceland, Japan, Norway and West Germany, partisan animosity has been consistently low.\nBritain has been lucky in that the hard camps which formed around Brexit did not translate into fixed party loyalties. Indeed, British voters have become increasingly willing to switch their allegiance between parties in recent years. In doing so they demonstrated a key weakness in anti-politics: at some level, competence matters. The disastrous mini-budget Liz Trusss administration brought forth in the autumn of 2022 caused a run on the pound and ended her premiership. No matter how strenuously she argued that she was sabotaged by the deep state, British voters realised that she had made them all poorerin other words, that politics is not in fact a zero-sum contest.\nA policys parlous results are not the only way that reality impinges on politicians ability to conjure up animosity out of thin air. A team of American political scientists found that the sharp partisan divide over how to deal with covid-19 was attenuated in people whose lives had been directly affected by the virus. For as long as refusing to mask up seemed like a badge of political allegiance, partisans would not wear them. If they discovered first-hand that this posed a danger to them or their family, they changed their ways.\nIn Poland Mr Tusk managed to convince voters that PiSs institutional capture threatened Polish democracy. In elections last year he banded with other parties to win power. Since taking office, he has sometimes used strong-arm tactics to replace PiS appointees, including at the state-run news agency and television and radio stations.\nBut reversing negative partisanship is not easy. Naturally, PiS has turned the accusation of abusing power back on Mr Tusk. Norms and institutions fall victim to partisan manoeuvring with distressing speed but, as Poland is likely to show, the work involved in restoring them is long and arduous.\nThe story in Israel is even more sobering. The country is a parable of how anti-politics can proliferate when the circumstances favour it. And its experience suggests that the process displays a lot of hysteresis. The baleful results persist even when the conditions which created them have shattered.\nBefore the murderous attacks launched by Hamas on October 7th 2023, Israel had been fertile ground for anti-politics. The sense of external threat had never been lower as Israel had made peace with one Arab country after another. Policy split the countrys citizens into groups. Many Israelis resented how the ultra-Orthodox did not have to serve in the armed forces. Despite being formally equal, Arab-Israelis were in effect second-class citizens. And the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was standing trial for corruption. Vehemently denying wrongdoing, he had spread conspiracy theories about how elements in the police and the prosecution joined forces with the leftist media to manufacture baseless cases against him.\nDivisions reached a critical stage in the summer of 2023. The most right-wing government in Israels history had set about changing the institutions in its own favour, by curbing the power of the Supreme Court. Its opponents were staging the countrys biggest-ever demonstrations. Reservists threatened not to turn up for duty with the Israeli army. Marking the 75th anniversary of his countrys independence, in a column in The Economist, Yair Lapid, an opposition leader and former prime minister, had fretted over whether Israel could remain a vibrant democracy.\nThe attacks on October 7th ought to have changed all that. The costs of division have been brutally cast in a new light. A sense of threat has been awakened, not only because 1,200 people were murdered that morning, but also because the country is now fighting Hamas in Gaza, Hizbullah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and has mounted air strikes on Iran. Despite this, though, Israel was united in grief and shock for only a few weeks. Quantitative data are still unavailable, but to Omer Yair of Reichman University in Israel, who studies polarisation, the country looks as split as it ever was. The right blames the left for weakening its defences before the attack; some of the left blames the right. Mr Netanyahu remains divisive despite Israels recent killing of the leaders of Hamas and Hizbullah. Israel shows that when anti-politics gets a firm enough grip, it can be hard to reverse.\nNowhere devotes as much money, study and talent to politics as America does. Nowhere is politics so shaped by sophisticated data about how voters behave. There is nothing wrong with this. But nor is it any protection against dysfunction. To some extent it seems the reverse.\nToo much of the effort goes into what the Russians call political technology: the hackery of winning elections by exploiting voters deep-rooted and universal instinct to stand together in the face of a threat. As the energy put into negative campaigning has swollen, so governing in America has atrophied. As governing has atrophied, so Americans have come to see Washington as a one-dimensional, zero-sum place where partisans fight over the spoils, but do nothing to make the whole country more prosperous. Casting normal politicians as extreme has exhausted the language of castigation, leaving no fresh words to use when real extremists bid for power.\nThe chart above shows how trust in government has collapsed over the past 60 years. The first thing to note is that it has fallen so low it is a wonder that anything can get done at all. The second is to note the pattern of the fall. In the 1960s and 1970s Republicans and Democrats were remarkably similar in their response to the unwinnable Vietnam war and the Watergate conspiracy under presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Under Ronald Reagan Republicans gained some faith; under Bill Clinton Democrats did; the 9/11 attacks under Mr Bush reminded Americans of all stripes that government matters. But only briefly. Today voters attitudes are upended the moment a president from the other party enters the White House, for no obvious reason other than they detest him and all his works.\nAs Lilliana Mason, a political scientist, notes, being a Democrat or a Republican has become a mega-identity that defines much else about how people choose to lead their lives. The consistency of that split is mysterious, but one reason may be that when voters are motivated by fear and mistrust they are unnerved by any single party gaining a consistent lead. Every election becomes a change election.\nThe vote on November 5th is a chance to begin to put this right. So far the signs are not good. Mr Trump has embraced an even more negative platform than before. He has condemned Ms Harris as a shit vice-president and said that shes a Marxist, shes a fascist in the same breath. He has talked of retribution against those he sees as having persecuted him, and given warning of vermin and the enemy within. And has declared in apocalyptic terms that this world is going down, to cheers from his supporters. He left truth-telling behind long ago; claims of a life-and-death political struggle between good and evil which started off as hyperbole have created the political space for bogeymen to become flesh.\nJoe Biden campaigned on the idea that Mr Trump was a tyrant in the makingand that voting for him was therefore morally bankrupt. For much of her campaign Ms Harris has tried to strike a more optimistic note. When she was catapulted into the nomination after Mr Biden withdrew in July, she sought to present herself as the candidate of change. Part of that was to look to the future, declaring in her convention speech that the election was a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. However, as she has failed to pull ahead in the polls, her rhetoric has become more negative. On October 23rd she seized on accusations by Mr Trumps former chief of staff to label her opponent a fascist.\nIf Mr Trump wins the election will America plunge still further into the dark anti-politics of animosity? Or, in contrast to Israel, will the external threat from China and its partners in Russia, Iran and North Korea help bring the country together? If Ms Harris wins andin contrast to 2020Mr Trump fails to persuade his party that the vote was stolen, will consultants take it as a sign that catastrophism has become a losing tactic? Could the next generation of leaders conclude that the country needs more of Ms Harriss optimism?\nIf so, a number of measures could help restore politics to health by showing that efficient government can benefit everybody, whatever party they belong to. Giving reasoned justifications for policies seems to work, presumably because voters can more easily understand how the government can serve the common good. Because perceptions of unfairness, and especially vote-buying, are linked to marked animosity against your own side and even more against the others, Americas obsession with cheating in elections is especially harmful. Lawrence Lessig of Harvard University argues that citizens assemblies are a way to jump-start a constructive phase of political engagement. An example is Ireland, which voted overwhelmingly to legalise same-sex marriage and abortion after 18-month assemblies overcame a seemingly unmovable legislative logjam.\nAcross the worlds democracies, the task is to restore faith in politics. If voters believe that politics can be fair and for the common good, they will be less angry. If they think about policies instead of heroes and villains, they are more likely to treat both parties as legitimate. People need to believe that politics is not just about deciding who gets what, but making life better or worse for everyone, and that the outcome depends on their own choices.\nIt surely counts for something that, whatever the merchants of grievance pretend, voters choices do in fact make a difference. Politics is often denigrated as cynical and dirty, but as Mr Obama argued in Chicago, it doesnt have to be like that. Bernard Crick, a political theorist, celebrated politics as a sublime human achievement. It enables complex societies to settle their differences and allocate scarce resources for the common good without resorting to violence. Compromise in politics creates the stability for people to be uncompromising in chasing their dreams.\nThe idea that the vote in America on November 5th could determine the path of history is the sort of grandiose claim you would expect from partisans trying to stir up their base. This time it might just be true. \nThis article appeared in the Essay section of the print edition under the headline The anti-politics eating the west\"",

He championed first-term successes in health care affordability, fully-funded kindergarten and preschool, and vowed to continue his pursuit to move Colorados electrical grid to renewable energy by 2040.\nPresident Joe Biden called Polis Tuesday evening to congratulate Polis on his victory, and, at a Democratic watch party at a Denver hotel, the governor thanked Ganahl and extended good will to those who voted against him.\nWhether you voted for me or not, I will work as hard as I possibly can on behalf of you and your family, Polis said as his supporters hooted and hollered, brandishing signs reading, Strong Steady Proven.\nGanahl campaigned on the slogan #MadMom as she pinned the blame on Polis for inflation, surging crime, underperforming schools and opioid overdose rates affecting youth. She insisted shed eliminate the state income tax and ask voters to reconsider a law signed by Polis enshrining the right to abortion into state law. Ganahl is a University of Colorado regent.\nGovernor Polis, I wish you well, and my prayers will be with you, Ganahl said in a concession statement. This election is over, but our problems are not. ... Please do not ignore the cries of help from so many in our state.\nPolis highlighted his administrations efforts to ease inflations burdens on Colorado families and address rampant car theft and other crimes that have soared in U.S. cities after the pandemic. He also came under withering criticism from Ganahl for opioid overdose rates that are taking their toll on Colorados children.\nPolis countered by criticizing Ganahl for appointing a running mate who has claimed that Joe Biden was not legitimately elected president in 2020.\nHe won during an election in which about seven in 10 Colorado voters say things in the country are heading in the wrong direction, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 2,700 voters in the state.\nAbout three-quarters of voters say the condition of the economy is either not so good or poor, the survey found, compared with about a quarter who call it excellent or good. About a third say their family is falling behind financially.\nThe Supreme Courts overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that recognized a constitutional right to abortion, also played a role in most voters decisions, with about eight in 10 calling it a factor in how they cast their ballot. About a quarter call the courts overturning of Roe the single most important factor in their vote.\nCourtney Danis, a 20-year-old psychology student, said the main reason she voted for Polis is to protect abortion rights for all women  even though she long opposed abortion on a personal level.\nCiting the Supreme Courts Roe decision, she said: I realized things can happen to people without them choosing it ... and its important to at least have a choice in (having an abortion).\n___\nAssociated Press writers Sarah Rankin in Washington, D.C., and Jesse Bedayn in Arvada, Colorado contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow APs coverage of the elections at: https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections\nCheck out https://apnews.com/hub/explaining-the-elections to learn more about the issues and factors at play in the 2022 midterm elections.",

Mr. Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development, would be one of the youngest presidents if elected.",0,1,2,11.227765560150146,"[{'title': 'BBC correspondents make US 2016 election predictions', 'date': '2015-11-09T00:55:35', 'content': 'It\'s a year out from the US presidential election. What do BBC reporters think will happen?\nThis time next year, barring a repeat of the cliffhanger election of 2000, we will know who the next president of the United States will be.\nBefore the votes are cast and counted, however, the candidates must survive a campaign that so far has confounded conventional wisdom.\nDespite the risks, our team of BBC experts agreed to take a stab at how they think events will unfold in 2016.\nWho will win the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses?\nBen Carson - I am not sure his view on the Egyptian pyramids being a grain store will be a help or hindrance in this farming state, but his evangelical views and outsider status will be a big help and will see him emerge victorious.\nHillary Clinton will do what she failed to do in 2008 and win Iowa.\nWhat issue/factors will be decisive in the nomination battle (for both parties)?\nLongevity, ground game, money, the polls - naturally.\nBut ideological purity whether on the left or right will only carry you so far. Candidates have to appeal to a broad swath of the electorate, and convince voters that they are the answer to what America needs and wants\nHow will the 2016 campaign be different to any previous election?\nInsurgency politics. There seems to be a willingness, yearning even, to embrace the outspoken, the outsider, the untried and untested like never before. I have heard it described as the ""post-truth age of politics"", where empirical data and analysis are a hindrance.\nWho will be on the final ticket for each party?\nPredictable one: Hillary Clinton for the Democrats. Unpredictable left field GOP option: John Kasich.\nWho wins in Iowa?\nBen Carson for the same reasons Rick Santorum won in 2012, Dr Carson is a true evangelical conservative.\nHillary Clinton - she lost it last time. Do you really think she\'s going to lose it again?\nWhat decides the nomination?\nGetting out the vote. Getting out the vote. Getting out the vote. Ask Mitt Romney.\nHow will 2016 be different?\nIt already is different. We\'ve never seen anything like this. Take record dissatisfaction with politicians, a political system that has failed to produce results for the past six years, and a desire for simplicity and reassurance in a time of complexity and disquiet and you have the perfect setting for political chaos (and that\'s not just in the US).\nWho will be on the ticket?\nI am not qualified to answer this question. On the day Trump announced, I said that would be the highlight of his campaign. I take little comfort from the fact that 90% of my colleagues said the same thing. However, if you put a gun to my head, or threaten to suspend my pay if I don\'t answer, I\'d probably mumble very quietly, so almost no one could hear..Rubio and Hillary. (Actually I\'d say, and have said all along, ""Hillary"" in a more confident voice.)\nWho wins in Iowa?\nAlthough Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently lead the polls on the Republican side, Texas Senator Ted Cruz has the money, grass-roots organisation and evangelical appeal to eke out a narrow win in the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton lost Iowa to Barack Obama in 2008 in part because she didn\'t spend enough time courting the notoriously fickle voters in smaller, more personal settings.\nShe\'s not making that mistake this time around, and combined with a massive team of on-the-ground personnel, she cruises to victory.\nWhat decides the nomination?\nThe 2016 Democratic nomination effectively was decided in 2008, when Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton, played the good soldiers and campaigned for Barack Obama despite a bruising primary battle that went all the way to the wire.\nIt will take some time for the Republican nomination to be locked up, but when it is it will be due to the party\'s delegate math. As campaign guru Charlie Cook points out, external, Republican voters in populous left-leaning ""blue zone"" states have a disproportionate influence on the nominating process. These voters tend to give the nod to a more moderate, electable choice.\nHow will 2016 be different?\nThe 2008 and 2012 elections were all about how social networks had revolutionised presidential campaigns by allowing likeminded people to meld into a powerful political force. In 2016 we will see this technology have an opposite, fragmentary effect. Narrow political interests, empowered by the social media megaphone, will have a corrosive effect on party unity.\nBernie Sanders progressives and Black Lives Matters activists won\'t be reliable team players for the Democrats, and neither will Tea Party grass-roots conservatives or Donald Trump nativists on the Republican side.\nWho will be on the ticket?\nFor the Republicans it\'s Marco Rubio and Nikki Haley for vice president. The Florida senator emerges as the establishment pick and outlasts Donald Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who divide up the outsider/anti-establishment vote.\nMr Rubio opts to put a woman on the ticket and goes for Ms Haley - the young, charismatic governor of South Carolina who gained national recognition after the Charleston shootings.\nThe biggest change this year, then, from previous contests is the unpredictability of the Republican primary race. Pundits make predictions based on political rationality: Who passes the plausibility test? Who looks like a president?\nRepublican primary voters, this cycle more than any other, are marked more by rebelliousness than rationality.\nWho will be on the ticket?\nTwo women, I suspect, will feature. Hillary Clinton will lead the Democratic ticket. Because of the party\'s advantages in the Electoral College and demographic factors, such as the relative shrinkage of America\'s white male electorate, she should start the race as favourite to become president.\nCarly Fiorina is positioning herself as a strong contender for the vice-presidential slot on the GOP ticket.\nAs for the GOP\'s presidential nominee? See above. But I\'m not anticipating a dynastic showdown between Clinton and Bush.', 'description': ""It's a year out from the US presidential election.

A man brushes the mouth of a sarcophagus.,0,1,4,6.751416206359863,"[{'title': ""I've been an embalmer for 14 years and see my share of bodies. Any questions?"", 'date': '2013-09-16T00:00:00', 'content': 'Jenn Park-Mustacchio is a licensed funeral director and embalmer who works in New Jersey, USA. She studied anthropology and human biology at the University of Pennsylvania, and has been in the funeral industry for 14 years. So what would you like to know? Leave your questions in the comments. Jenn will pop in throughout the day to answer them.\nTake us through a regular day at work:\nTypically, my day begins when someone dies. Since I\'m a trade embalmer, I don\'t handle the first call or transport of a deceased person (although I\'ve previously done both). My boss calls me, and I arrive at the funeral home shortly after the deceased has been taken into our care to begin the embalming process. I suit up in personal protective equipment (a gown, apron, shoe covers, gloves etc) and evaluate the person to decide how I will proceed. Every case is different and requires a special combination of fluids (which are mixed according to the height, weight and physical conditions of the deceased). I mix the fluids accordingly and begin to set the features.\nSetting the features involves closing the eyes and mouth and placing cotton in the mouth to give the person a more natural expression. Next, I gently flex the arms, legs and fingers to relieve the muscle tension or stiffness of rigor mortis. I position the hands one over the other, wash the body, cover the genitals (to preserve modesty) and prepare the tools I will need to embalm.\nTypically, we use a scalpel to make a small incision near the right collarbone. From there, we search for the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein. A small incision is made in each. Arterial tubes are placed in the artery (one is directed towards the heart, while the other is directed towards the head). A drain tube, or angled forceps, is also placed in the vein to facilitate drainage of blood. The hose, connected to the embalming machine, is then connected to the arterial tube directed towards the heart. The embalming machine is then adjusted to regulate pressure (the force of the fluid) and rate of flow (speed of the fluid). These knobs are adjusted differently during embalming for each case to create the optimum rate of injection for the body. The machine is switched on and the fluid begins to move through the hose, through the arterial tube and into the body. As the embalming fluid is pushed through the arterial system, the blood is forced out through the jugular vein.\nThe body is vigorously massaged with a soapy sponge to help facilitate drainage and distribution of embalming fluid. The tissue will begin to firm and take on a rosy appearance, which is an excellent indication of adequate distribution and a successful embalming. The tubes are then removed, the vein and artery tied off and the incision is sutured. Next, the cavity is treated. Fluid is suctioned from the hollow organs with an instrument called a trocar, then a high-index (very strong) fluid is placed into the cavity and the incision is closed with a small circular plastic button like device referred to as a trocar button. The deceased is again washed. Their hair is combed and cream is placed on their face to prevent skin dehydration. The deceased is then covered and will remain in the preparation room until they are dressed, cosmetized and ready to be placed into a casket for viewing.\nTypically the viewing takes place a few days after death. So I will clean up the prep room and leave until it\'s time for the next embalming or until its time to dress and casket someone who\'s been previously embalmed.\n*The above is a description of a ""typical"" embalming. If a person dies tragically (murder, suicide, automobile accident) the embalming process is drastically different.\nTell us about something surprising, or unexpected, that happened to you while working:\nI\'ve had several interesting things happen on the job, but one particular moment comes to mind. I went in for a 3am embalming and heard a strange whisper. I quickly fumbled for the lights and, upon turning them on, figured out that the noise was coming from the occupied stretcher. I approached with caution expecting the person inside could be alive. However, upon unzipping the cover, I found a tape recorder (that I later found out was playing a Buddhist chant). The next day the family explained that, ideally, a monk would be at the place of death to chant when the soul exits the body. Chanting calms the soul, which the buddhists believe, is in a state of confusion and fright after exiting the body. The soul of the deceased must be put at ease with food and chant throughout the difficult time of transition. This particular experience was both enlightening and frightening!\nWhat makes for a really good day at work?\nMy job is fulfilling when a particularly difficult case comes out better than expected. If a family decides to keep a casket open, when they previously thought they wouldn\'t be able to, or when someone compliments my work. The best compliment I got was from a woman whose daughter died of bone cancer. She took my hand and said, ""Thank you, she\'s so beautiful, she looks like she could get up and dance.""\nWhat is your salary? Do you get benefits?\nThe median annual income for funeral directors in the US is over $52,000 (with the annual salary in New Jersey averaging above $79,000). Regulations vary state by state, but here in New Jersey we are embalmers/funeral directors and are licensed to handle all aspects of the funeral (from first call to final disposition). In other states they have separate licenses for funeral directors and embalmers.\nEven though I am licensed to perform all aspects of the business, I work as an embalmer because I enjoy that particular aspect of the business and found that it allows me to spend a significant amount of time with my family. Trade embalmers, like myself, are paid by the job. Usually we work for more than one location and will embalm, dress, casket, cosmetize and do restorative work. Trade embalmers have the potential to make significantly more than the average funeral director depending on how many locations they work for and how busy those locations are. However, we do not receive health benefits because we are not full-time employees.\nHave you ever made a mistake at work?\nI\'m fortunate enough to say that I have not made any major mistakes. When I was an intern, I was super careful and very aware that any mistake I made could potentially affect the grieving process of the deceased friends and loved ones, so I always consulted with senior funeral directors if I was unsure of what to do or how to proceed with difficult cases.\nDo you have an interesting job?

A normally busy street near Potsdamer Platz on Tuesday in Berlin.,0,1,5,6.027730941772461,"[{'title': 'The Berlin Wall Through Time', 'date': '2009-11-09T00:00:00', 'content': ""'Open This Gate'\nDrawn to the citys historic Brandenburg Gate as word spread on the night of Nov. 9, 1989, both East and West Berliners clambered up the wall and crowded Pariser Platz to take part in the opening. Two years earlier at this spot, Ronald Reagan had implored Mikhail Gorbachev in a speech to open this gate, to tear down this wall.\nToday, the entire area around the 18th century landmark gate, just south of the Reichstag building where the German parliament meets, is a pedestrian plaza. The Quadriga -- the bronze sculpture atop the Brandenburg Gate -- depicts a chariot drawn by four horses and driven by Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The horses face east.\nStreet of History\nVisitors used the graffiti-pocked Berlin Wall as a backdrop for souvenir photos along Ebertstrasse, which runs south generally from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz.\nToday, Ebertstrasse is the location of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe as well as the new U.S. Embassy. It was also along this street that Roger Waters of Pink Floyd held an outdoor performance of the rock opera The Wall in 1990, eight months after the Berlin Wall fell, for which an estimated 350,000 people gathered.\nBoth Sides Now\nAfter the wall was breached, people could view the two sides of Berlin at once for the first time in decades. Here, a photographer straddles the wall looking up toward the Reichstag, where the German parliament convenes, on Nov. 10, 1989, a day after the fall.\nToday, evidence of the Berlin Wall is embedded in the pavement of streets it once divided; here, a long, double cobblestone line shows the former location of the wall along what is now bustling Ebertstrasse.\nA New Look\nEast German border soldiers and their Klieg lights were trained on the intersection of Zimmerstrasse and Charlottenstrasse, not far from the famous Allied checkpoint Charlie. In this March 1990 photo, the patrol towers were abandoned but the wall had not been removed.\nBy 2009, the corner of Zimmerstrasse and Charlottenstrasse had been completely reconstructed with offices, shops and apartments. Overall, eastern Germany has clawed its way back to a measure of prosperity.\nAll Along the Watchtower\nThe wall cut off the eastern end of the Lohmuehlenbruecke, the bridge over the Neukollner Schifffahrtskanal, leaving the part of the city called Neukoelln in West Berlin and its neighbors in Treptow in East Berlin. Near here, the first watchtower was erected in the so-called death strip between the outer and inner walls, and various buildings were razed to give guards a better overview.

"After telling officers he was 'about to die', Floyd eventually lost consciousness and would never regain it",0,1,1,6.346357583999634,"[{'title': 'FactChecking the First Trump', 'date': '2020-09-30T08:52:30', 'content': 'Note: This story has been corrected. Read more.\nSummary\nPresident Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden met on the debate stage for the first time and stretched or mangled facts on several topics:\nTrump exaggerated instances of election fraud, misleadingly citing ballots found  in creeks and a case where a thousand voters were mistakenly sent two ballots. Neither is evidence of fraud.\nTrump falsely claimed that Biden supports the Medicare for All plan. He never did.\nBiden got it wrong when he claimed there was 15% less violence during his time in office than today. The violent crime rate dropped under Trump.\nTrump misleadingly claimed people werent allowed to watch the polls in Philadelphia. Only satellite elections offices, where voters can return mail-in ballots, are open now.\nTrump claimed he had been endorsed by the sheriff in Portland, which isnt true, and he suggested that Biden had gotten no support from law enforcement officials, which is false.\nTrump boasted that he brought back 700,000 manufacturing jobs, which was never true. Currently 237,000 have been lost.\nTrump denied that climate change plays a role in Californias wildfires. Scientists say its a contributing factor.\nBoth candidates gave potentially misleading impressions of when Americans can expect a COVID-19 vaccine.\nBiden said 10 million people lost their employer-sponsored insurance during the pandemic, but the study he relies upon also said all but 3.5 million of them would regain insurance from another source.\nBiden said Trumps Supreme Court nominee has written  that she thinks the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. Not quite, though she faulted a 2012 opinion upholding the law.\nTrump claimed that drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. Actually its not clear what the impact of his executive orders will be.\nTrump said Biden called military members stupid bastards, which Biden denied. The vice president did use those words while addressing troops overseas in 2016, but his campaign has said it was in jest.\nTrump wrongly said Biden forgot the name of his college. Biden in 2019 said he started out of  Delaware State, but a university official said Biden was referring to announcing his Senate bid on campus.\nTrump said that he has given big incentives for electric cars. Hes actually tried to eliminate programs to encourage their manufacture and sale.\nBiden falsely claimed that Trump didnt try to send experts to China early in the coronavirus pandemic.\nTrump said when Biden was working on the 1994 crime bill, he called African Americans super-predators. Actually, that was a phrase famously uttered by Hillary Clinton  not Biden  about some gangs of kids.\nTrump said I dont think Kellyanne Conway, his former White House counselor, said riots and chaos and violence help his cause, as Biden claimed. Conway did say something like that.\nBiden wrongly claimed that the United States has a higher deficit with China now than we did before in talking about trade. The deficit is actually lower.\nTrump claimed that in relaxing the Obama administrations more stringent fuel economy standards, cars would be $3,500 cheaper. Even going by the administrations analysis, thats inflated.\nAnd there were more claims on topics including veterans, the economy and preexisting conditions.\nThe two presidential candidates debated on Sept. 29 in Cleveland. Fox News Chris Wallace was the moderator.\nAnalysis\nTrumps Flimsy Election Fraud Case\nMaking his case that mail-in voting has already resulted in large scale fraud, Trump cited two examples that are not evidence of fraud at all.\nTheres fraud, Trump said. They found them in creeks.  They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots, everybody got two. This is going to be fraud like youve never seen.\nIn recent days, Trump has referred to ballots found in a ditch or a riverbed or, as he did during the debate, in creeks. Law enforcement officials in Wisconsin reported that three trays of mail were found Sept. 21 along the side of a road and in a ditch next to a highway in Greenville. Officials there said the batch of mail included several absentee ballots, though a Postal Service spokesman would not comment on whether those were completed ballots, or blank ones being sent to voters, according to the Post Crescent. The paper quoted the county clerk saying election officials started to mail out ballots to voters on Sept. 17.\nAs for the claim about a thousand people being sent two ballots, thats true. As NBC4 in Washington reported, election officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, believe up to 1,000 people who requested mail-in ballots may have gotten two by mistake. But its not evidence of fraud. Those people who got two ballots wont be able to vote twice.\nFairfax County Registrar Gary Scott said that when every ballot is returned, we make an entry into their voter record that they have returned a ballot. So if something else shows up, the ballot has already been returned. We cant count that ballot.\nAnd despite Trumps repeated warning about large-scale fraud with mail-in voting, as we have noted, while the instances of voter fraud via mail-in or absentee ballots are more common than in-person voting fraud, the number of known cases is relatively rare.\nIts Bidens Health Plan, Not Sanders\nTrump interrupted Bidens discussion of his health plan to falsely claim that Biden supports Sen. Bernie Sanders Medicare for All plan. The president wrongly claimed that the two rivals for the Democratic nomination agreed to it in the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations report.\nTrump: Joe, you agree with Bernie Sanders  whos far left  on the manifesto, we call it, and that gives you socialized medicine. Are you saying you didnt agree?\nBiden does not agree with Sanders plan. The task force report reflected Bidens health care plan  which he unveiled in July 2019 during his primary fight with Sanders and others.\nBidens plan, among other things, offers a Medicare-style public health insurance option as a choice and increases tax credits for individuals purchasing insurance on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. His website says his plan to build on the Affordable Care Act will insure more than an estimated 97% of Americans.\nHeres what the task force report says: Democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen, and build upon our bedrock health care programs, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Affairs system. Private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide affordable, quality coverage to every American. To achieve that objective, we will give all Americans the choice to select a high-quality, affordable public option through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\nTrump also said youre going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, another reference to Medicare for All. Again, Biden doesnt support that plan.\nViolent Crime\nBiden was wrong when he said there was less violence during his time as vice president than there is today.\nBiden: When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today.\nIts true that the number of all violent crimes per 100,000 people declined 15.7% during the Obama-Biden years (even taking into consideration a 6.5% jump in their final two years). That may have been the point Biden wanted to make.\nBut the same FBI figures contradict Bidens claim that there was less violence then than today. Annual figures show that last years violent crime rate was 5.1% lower than in 2016. Furthermore, the decline seems to have continued into the first half of 2020 according to preliminary semiannual FBI figures, despite an alarming 14.8% increase in the number of homicides, compared with the same six months in 2019.\nTrumps Misleading Remarks on Bad Things in Philadelphia\nNear the end of the debate, Wallace asked whether the candidates would urge their supporters to refrain from civil unrest and also pledge to withhold declaring victory until the election results are certified.\nTrump said he was urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully and then said: As you know today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch  theyre called poll watchers. Its a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They werent allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things.\nThe day marked the first day that the city opened satellite elections offices  where residents can register to vote, or request and return mail-in ballots  and at least one woman who reportedly claimed to be a poll watcher for the Trump campaign was barred from entering a satellite office in an elementary school.\nBut the Trump campaign doesnt have any approved poll watchers in the city, elections officials told thePhiladelphia Inquirer, and the satellite offices in operation are not the same as Election Day polling locations  so poll watchers dont have the same privileges.\nAl Schmidt, a Republican and a city commissioner who oversees elections, told the Inquirer: We dont give someone a poll watcher certificate to  watch somebody fill out their ballot at their kitchen table.\nNick Custodio, a Philadelphia deputy commissioner, said in a statement to NBC News that the Satellite Offices are not Polling Places. Poll watcher certificates have not been issued for any individuals for anything other than poll watching activities on Election Day at Polling Places.\nIndividuals who are not seeking to receive services from a Satellite Office are not permitted to be there for other purposes, the statement said. This is particularly important in the current environment as City buildings and offices remain closed to the public due to COVID-19.\nLaw Enforcement Endorsements\nTrump touted his support from law enforcement organizations, but he was wrong to claim the support of a Portland, Oregon, official. He also went too far in claiming that Biden got no similar endorsements.\nExcuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, I support President Trump, Trump said, looking across the stage at Biden. I dont think you have any law enforcement. You cant even say law enforcement.\nBoth of those things are wrong.\nThe sheriff in Multnomah County, which includes the city of Portland, took to Twitter to clarify that he has not endorsed Trump.\nIn tonights presidential debate the President said the Portland Sheriff supports him. As the Multnomah County Sheriff I have never supported Donald Trump and will never support him, Sheriff Michael Reese tweeted.\nPortland rose to national prominence after federal agents arrived there this summer as protests against police brutality and racism boiled following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in May. At the end of July, federal agents agreed to step back and local authorities took over. Reese had expressed concern about the conduct of the federal agents at the time.\nTrump has, however, received the endorsement of another sheriff in an area thats recently gotten national attention  David Beth, the sheriff in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is supporting the presidents reelection bid. Kenosha drew protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August.\nAs for the suggestion that Biden has garnered no support from law enforcement officials, thats false. The former vice president is backed by more than 175 current and former law enforcement officials.\nManufacturing Jobs\nBiden and Trump sparred over manufacturing jobs, but neither gave an accurate account.\nTrump: I brought back 700,000 [manufacturing] jobs; they brought back nothing.\nBiden: Even before COVID  manufacturing went into a hole.\nThe fact is, 237,000 manufacturing jobs have been lostbetween the time Trump took office and August, the most recent month for which figures are available.\nTo be sure, there was a gain of 499,000 (but not 700,000) between Trumps inauguration and November of last year, when the number peaked a few months prior to the COVID-19 pandemics arrival.\nFrom there they slipped a bit but didnt exactly go into a hole, as Biden claimed  declining by only 62,000 by the time Trump declared a national COVID-19 emergency in March. That was followed by a two-month plunge of nearly 1.1 million manufacturing jobs, fewer than half of which have since been regained.\nFurthermore, Trump was wrong when he said Obama-Biden brought back nothing. Yes, 578,000 jobs were lost during their first four-year term, which included the Great Recession that had begun in 2007 and raged for months after they took office. But 386,000 jobs were in fact brought back in their second term.\nClimate Change & Wildfires\nIn an exchange with Wallace, Trump reluctantly acknowledged that greenhouse gases warm the planet to an extent but insisted that better forest management could solve Californias wildfire problem.\nIn fact, scientists best estimate is that human activities, including human-produced greenhouse gases, are responsible for more than 100% of the observed warming of the Earth. And while improved forest management techniques can help reduce the risk of some wildfires, climate change and other factors, including humans living in wildfire-prone areas, are also important.\nWhen Wallace asked the president what he believed about climate change, Trump sidestepped the question, saying, I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water, and do whatever else we can thats good.\nWhen pressed again on whether he thinks greenhouse gases contribute to the global warming of the planet, Trump said, I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes.\nHe added, But I also think that we have to do better on forest management of our forests, explaining that he gets calls about wildfires in California every year, and that if you had good forest management, you wouldnt be getting those calls.\nTrump then went on to point to Europes forest cities, saying that those places avoid fires because they maintain their forests, while California burns down because of a lack of management.\nAs weve written, Trump is wrong to say that fires only occur because of poor management and to suggest that human-sourced greenhouse gases are only a small component of warming.\nAs University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Daniel Swain told us earlier this month, the Earth is warming due to the increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases resulting from human activities. Climate change, he said, is acting as a pervasive force across the landscape and is increasing the severity of wildfire across a wide range of vegetation typesmeaning that climate change is an important factor in understanding the severity of *all* of the fires currently burning.\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Timing\nAs he has before, Trump exaggerated the best estimates for when a COVID-19 vaccine will be made available to the American public, claiming that the vaccine companies can go faster than the time frames previously provided by government officials.\nWell, Ive spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner, Trump said in response to Wallaces point that both Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield and Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui have said that a vaccine might not be widely available to the general public until the summer.\nThe president went on to suggest, without evidence, that any delay would be political.\nThey can go faster than that by a lot, Trump said of the vaccine companies, adding that were going to deliver [vaccines] right away when Wallace clarified that he was talking about a vaccine for the general public.\nTrump is correct that the government plans on shipping vaccines within 24 hours of an authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, but that doesnt mean all doses would be immediately available to non-prioritized Americans.\nAssuming one or more shots are found safe and effective, initial doses for prioritized groups may be available by the end of the year or in early 2021, with members of the general public getting doses after that.\nWe may have enough vaccine by the end of the year to immunize probably, I would say, between 20 and 25 million people, Slaoui told NPR earlier this month. And then we will ramp up the manufacturing of vaccine doses to be able to, based on our plans, have enough vaccine to immunize the U.S. population by the middle of 2021.\nBiden wasnt specific about which groups he had in mind when he gave his expected time table for vaccine distribution, but his description left out the possibility of some people receiving shots in 2020.\nEvery serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, he said. But the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out.\nAgain, if a vaccine passes FDA muster, it is plausible a subset of the prioritized population could be immunized this year.\nConway on Violence\nBiden and Trump disagreed on whether former White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said riots and chaos and violence happening in certain cities helps Trump. Conway did say something along those lines, as Biden said.\nBiden: You know his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. Thats what this is about.\nTrump: I dont know who said that.\nBiden: I do.\nTrump: Who?\nBiden: Kellyanne Conway.\nTrump: I dont think she said that.\nBiden was referring to comments Conway made during an Aug. 27 appearance on Fox & Friends.\nOne of the shows hosts asked Conway if protests for racial justice that turned violent in several cities, including Kenosha, Wisconsin, were all Donald Trumps fault, as some had suggested, including Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\nConway said no, and added that Trump was the one trying to get law and order restored.\nShe later said she had seen a quote that day from an unnamed restauranteur in Wisconsin who asked, Are you protestors trying to get Donald Trump reelected?\nHe knows full stop, and I guess Mayor Pete knows full stop, that the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on whos best on public safety and law and order, Conway said, indicating Trump was the clear choice.\nBiden Spins Health Care Plan Losses\nBiden said that 10 million Americans lost their employer-based insurance coverage during the COVID-19 recession. A study did find that, but it also said most would regain insurance from another source, leaving 3.5 million of them uninsured.\nBiden: He is not for any help for people needing health care because, he, in fact, already has cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers because of his recession.\nThat figure comes from an Urban Institute study, though the study said most of those 10 million would regain insurance from another source.\nThe Urban Institute estimated that job losses would cause 10.1 million people to lose their employer-sponsored coverage from April through December. But many would switch to insurance through another family member, Medicaid or the individual market, leaving 3.5 million uninsured in the end.\nUrban Institute, July 13, 2020: We find that 48 million people will live in families with a worker who experiences a COVID-19-related job loss in the last three quarters of 2020. Of them, 10.1 million lose employer coverage tied to that job. We estimate 32 percent of these people switch to another source of employer coverage through a family member, 28 percent enroll in Medicaid, and 6 percent enroll in the nongroup market, mainly in marketplace coverage with premium tax credits. Still, we estimate 3.5 million people in this group become uninsured.\nThe study also said about 500,000 people who were uninsured before the economic impacts of the coronavirus would become eligible for Medicaid and enroll. That would result in a net 2.9 million uninsured.\nOther estimates give higher figures for the uninsured. Families USA, which advocates for health care consumers, estimated that 5.4 million laid-off workers had lost health insurance between February and May, adding that the estimate didnt include family members of those workers who also would have lost coverage.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 26.8 million could lose employer insurance as of May 2. The vast majority of those  79%  would be eligible for subsidized coverage, either through Medicaid or tax credits to help purchase coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. But KKF said it did not estimate take-up or enrollment in coverage options but rather only looked at eligibility for coverage.\nVA Deaths\nTrump said during the Obama-Biden administration, you had 308,000 military people dying because you couldnt provide them proper health care in the military.\nBut the Trump campaign said that is based on a 2015 report from the Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector General that didnt say those were all deaths of people who applied for VA health care, or that the deaths all occurred when Biden was vice president.\nThe report, titled Veterans Health Administration: Review of Alleged Mismanagement at the Health Eligibility Center, said that, as of Sept. 30, 2014, 307,173 of nearly 867,000 pending applications for VA health care belonged to individuals who had died, according to the Social Security Administration.\nBut, as weve written before, the report also said that poor record-keeping and data limitations made it impossible to say how many of those individuals died while waiting for care, how many of them had applied for care, or even how many of them were military veterans.\nFurthermore, the report said 84%, or 258,367, of individuals who died with a pending application, died more than four years before September 2014, including some who died even before 1998, when the VA established its enrollment database. Former President Barack Obama and Biden took office Jan. 20, 2009.\nUnplugging Electric Car Incentives\nThe president claimed to support the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles during a portion of the debate on climate change, saying, Ive given big incentives for electric cars.\nBut his record doesnt reflect that.\nA 2019 report from the Congressional Research Service identified three federal programs that incentivize the manufacture or purchase of electric vehicles  the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which supports production of fuel-efficient vehicles; the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which are aimed at increasing fuel efficiency; and the Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle tax credit, which gives tax credits to purchasers of electric vehicles.\nAll three programs predate the Trump administration, and the president has proposed eliminating two of them.\nIn his budget for fiscal year 2020, Trump proposed eliminating the Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Tax Credit, which had been introduced in 2008. The following year, Trump sought to eliminate the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program in his 2021 budget proposal. That program had been established in 2007.\nSending Disease Experts to China\nBiden falsely charged that the Trump administration did not try to send experts to Wuhan, China  where the novel coronavirus outbreak emerged late last year  during the early stages of the pandemic.\nBiden: He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was, he knew it was a deadly disease  we were insisting that the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask [President] Xi to do that.  He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us.\nThe former vice president has made similar inaccurate claims before. [W]hen we were talking  early on in this crisis, we said  I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know whats actually happening, Biden said at a CNN virtual town hall on March 27. There was no effort to do that.\nIn fact, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to get CDC personnel to the scene just one week after China reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019, as we have written.\nOn January 6, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a Jan. 28 press conference. I reiterated that offer when I spoke to Chinas Minister of Health on Monday, and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today. We are urging China: More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response.\nMore than a week later, Azar said again at a Feb. 7 press conference that our longstanding offer to send world-class experts to China to assist remains on the table.\nIn mid-February a World Health Organization team including two Americans visited China, including Wuhan. The 25-member team, which visited China for nine days from Feb. 16 to Feb. 24, included one official from the CDC and another from the National Institutes of Health. The team issued a 40-page report on Feb. 28  about two weeks before the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic.\nAt a briefing of the White House coronavirus task force in March, Trump said that he brought the issue up with Chinese President Xi Jinping personally.\nTrump, March 22: And I did ask him whether or not we could send some people, and they didnt want that  out of pride. I think, really, out of pride. They dont want  they dont want us sending people into China, to help them. You know, China is a strong country. They have  they have their scientists and they have their doctors  very smart. A lot of people.\nAnd, you know, but I did discuss that about sending our people in. And, they didnt really respond. We went again; they didnt respond.\nPreexisting Conditions and the ACA\nBiden said Trump was in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and that theres a 100 million people who have preexisting conditions and theyll be taken away as well, those preexisting conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. Trump replied: There arent 100 million people with preexisting conditions.\nThere are 100 million people with preexisting conditions, not including those with Medicare or Medicaid coverage, according to one estimate from the consulting firm Avalere. Its unclear what Biden meant when he said theyll be taken away as well, but if the ACA were nullified, they would lose the preexisting condition protections in that law. But only those who seek coverage on the individual market  where those without employer or public insurance buy plans  would be at risk of being denied insurance.\nAs weve written before, the Trump administration has backed a lawsuit to invalidate the ACA, which instituted sweeping protections for those with preexisting conditions. The ACA prohibited insurers, in any market, from denying coverage, charging more or excluding coverage of certain conditions based on health status.\nBefore the ACA, those buying plans on the individual market could face denials or higher premiums based on their health. But only 6% of the population gets coverage on the individual market.\nEmployer-based coverage  where 49% of the population gets insurance  couldnt deny insurance, before the ACA. But those plans could decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period, if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.\nIts unclear what preexisting condition protections would be implemented under the Trump administration in lieu of the ACA, but Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 that said access to health insurance despite underlying health conditions should be maintained even if the ACA were struck down in court.\nBiden also said that if the Trump-backed lawsuit were successful, it will strip 20 million people from having insurance. Thats a reference to the number who gained insurance under the ACA, according to a few estimates.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2017 that if the ACA were repealed and not replaced with new legislation, the uninsured would increase by 32 million over 10 years. (However, some people would choose not to have insurance, CBO said, because they had coverage in order to avoid a penalty. That penalty was eliminated effective in 2019.)\nAmy Coney Barrett on the ACA\nBiden said Trumps Supreme Court nominee  Judge Amy Coney Barrett  has written  that she thinks the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. Not quite, though she faulted a 2012 opinion upholding the law.\nBarrett did criticize Chief Justice John Roberts opinion in NFIB v. Sebelius, which upheld the ACA but found states couldnt be forced to expand Medicaid under the law. Writing in January 2017 in the Notre Dame Law School journal, Barrett reviewed a book by Randy Barnett. She said: In NFIB v. Sebelius, the inspiration for Barnetts book, Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute didas a penaltyhe would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congresss commerce power.  Barnett is surely right that deference to a democratic majority should not supersede a judges duty to apply clear text.  If the majority did not enact a tax, interpreting the statute to impose a tax lacks democratic legitimacy.\nThats clearly a critique of Roberts opinion. But some legal scholars have said the writing doesnt indicate how Barrett might rule on the ACA case now before the court: California v. Texas. That case concerns whether the elimination of the ACA tax penalty under the 2017 GOP tax law makes the individual mandate (the requirement for most people to have insurance) unconstitutional  and if without the mandate, the entire law must be struck down.\nNicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, told NBC News Barretts journal article doesnt tell us anything about how shed rule in a case thats significantly weaker. He said that ACA supporters should be concerned but [n]ot panicked.\nPrescription Drugs\nTrump said: Im cutting drug prices. Im going with favored nations.  Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. Trump signed four executive orders on drug prices in late July, but it remains to be seen how the orders will be implemented and whether they will result in large reductions in prices.\nAs weve explained, the orders, which largely revive past administration proposals, require the Health and Human Services secretary to take various actions, such as moving through the federal rule-making process.\nTwo of the orders pertain to Medicare beneficiaries. Another order concerns insulin and epinephrine for low-income individuals, and the fourth involves allowing the importation of some drugs.\nTrumps reference to favored nations concerns an updated executive order signed Sept. 13. It calls on the HHS secretary to test payment models to tie Medicare drug prices to the lowest price among comparable countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nAn HHS spokesperson told us in July that Medicare currently pays roughly 80% more than other countries for Part B drugs, which are outpatient drugs administered by a physician. But again, whether this policy could lead to an 80% reduction for those drugs remains to be seen.\nCDC Director on Face Masks\nOn the topic of face masks, Biden wrongly claimed Trumps own head of the CDC said  if everybody wore masks and social distanced between now and January, wed probably save up to 100,000 lives.\nThat was a projection from the University of Washingtons Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation  not Dr. Robert Redfield.\nOn Sept. 3, IHME said its model projected there would be 410,000 cumulative U.S. deaths from COVID-19 by January 2021, and that 122,000 of those deaths could be prevented with increased mask use. As of Sept. 24, the model downgraded its estimate to a total death toll of 372,000 in the U.S., 97,000 of which could be avoided with near-universal masking.\nRedfield, though, did say in congressional testimony on Sept. 16 that face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have against COVID-19.\nI will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings, he said. Ive said it, if we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks wed bring this pandemic under control.  We have clear scientific evidence they work and they are our best defense. I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.\nLater that day, on Twitter, he added: The best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds.\nBut thats not the same as saying 100,000 lives could be saved by wearing masks.\nBidens Stupid Bastards Remark in Context\nBiden at one point made reference to a recent story by the Atlantic that, citing anonymous sources, reported that Trump privately denigrated fallen soldiers as losers and suckers. Trump later returned to the point by denying the claim and suggested it was actually Biden who spoke ill of the military.\nWhat he did, was he said  he called the military stupid bastards, Trump said.\nI did not say that, Biden responded.\nAnd he said it on tape, Trump continued.\nBiden did use those words during a trip to Abu Dhabi in March 2016, and it is on tape. But the full context of the video suggests that Biden was joking, which his campaign has maintained.\nAfter Biden referenced the incredible sacrifices you make for our country, he went on to tell the crowd that he has incredibly good judgment. He mentions marrying his wife, Jill, then refers to having nominated Lt. Karen Johnson to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy years earlier. Johnson was on stage.\nOne, I married Jill. And two, I appointed Johnson to the academy. I just want you to know that, he said. Clap for that, you stupid bastards. He then jokingly called the group a dull bunch.\nBiden was jokingly encouraging the audience to clap for an airwoman on the stage, his campaign said in a recent statement to the Daily Beast.\nDelaware State\nTrump distorted the context of comments Biden made in 2019 to claim that Biden wrongly said he attended college at Delaware State University, one of the nations historically Black colleges and universities, when he actually went to the University of Delaware.\nYou said you went to Delaware State but you forgot the name of your college, Trump said. You didnt go to Delaware State.\nThe origin of Trumps claim is a story in the Washington Times, which included a clip of Biden at a town hall event in Florence, South Carolina, on Oct. 26, 2019, in which he said, when discussing funding for HBCUs, I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State. The paper stated that while Biden declared last year on the campaign trail that he began his academic career at Delaware State University, a university official confirmed he was never a student there.\nThat official, Carlos Holmes, the universitys director of news services, says his response was used in a dishonest light.\nWatched in full context, it is clear that Biden was discussing his long association with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, not making a claim that he had attended Delaware State University, Holmes told Delaware State News. He got his start when he announced his first run for the US Senate on our campus in 1972 with then-Delaware State College President Luna Mishoe at his side. For three decades, first as US Senator and then as Vice President, Joe Biden has been our advocate and partner to such a critical extent that in 2003 the University awarded him an honorary doctorate.\nTrump Wrong on Super-Predators\nTrump repeatedly claimed that when Biden was spearheading the 1994 crime bill, he called African Americans super-predators, and theyve never forgotten it. Actually, that was a phrase famously uttered by Hillary Clinton  not Biden.\nI never said it, Biden responded, but Trump continued to insist he did.\nWe looked into this when Trump made a similar claim in a Fox News interview a month ago, and we couldnt find any evidence that Biden has used that term.\nAs then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden did spearhead the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Although the bill received bipartisan support at the time, it has been criticized for some of its provisions, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, and its impact on mass incarceration, particularly of Black men. As we have written, the trend of increasing imprisonment began well before 1994, but experts told us the 1994 law exacerbated the issue.\nAs we said, it was actually Hillary Clinton who used the phrase super-predator in a 1996 speech at New Hampshires Keene State College in support of the 1994 crime bill, which was signed by her husband, then-President Bill Clinton.\nThey are not just gangs of kids anymore, Clinton said. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators. No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\nInterestingly, Trump often criticized Clinton during her 2016 presidential bid for using that term, and Clinton has since acknowledged, Looking back, I shouldnt have used those words, and I wouldnt use them today.\nTrumps Swine Flu Spin\nIn criticizing the Obama administrations handling of the 2009 H1N1 flu, Trump told Biden you were a disaster  your own chief of staff said you were a disaster.\nRon Klain, Bidens former chief of staff, last year said the Obama administration did every possible thing wrong, but he said he was talking about delays in the production of a vaccine  not the administrations overall response. The record supports Klain.\nAt a May 14, 2019, Pandemic and Biosecurity Policy Summit,Klain said the administration has a bunch of really talented, really great people working on it and we did every possible thing wrong. Klains comments following that assessment focused solely on the rollout of vaccines.\nWhat did that [the experience in 2009] tell us? It told us that the vaccine will arrive late, Klain said at the pandemic policy summit. It told us that if its not prepared in advance, it will arrive late. If we dont have the answer before, were not going to get the answer in time. And it told us that our systems for deciding how to distribute and administer a vaccine in the time of crisis are going to be badly, badly tested.\nShutting Down the Economy\nOn the subject of reopening businesses that were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump said several times that Biden wants to shut down the country.\nWe dont know what Biden wants to do, but he did say last month that hed be willing to shut down the economy if scientists said it was necessary. He has since said he doesnt think that will be necessary.\nIn an Aug. 21 interview with ABC News, Biden was asked: If youre sworn in come January, and we have coronavirus and the flu combining, which many scientists have said is a real possibility, would you be prepared to shut this country down again?\nBiden said, I will be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus.\nWhen asked for clarification, he responded, I would shut it down, I would listen to the scientists.\nIn a press conference more than a week later, Biden said another shutdown would likely not be needed if certain steps were taken.\nTheres going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy, Biden told reporters Sept. 2. I got asked by David Muir a question, if I was asked to shut everything down. I took that as a generic question if  am I going to follow the science? I am going to insist  and I insist now, without any authority, that every responsible person in this country, when theyre out in public or not with the cohort that they have lived with because they know they havent spread it to their husband, wife, etc., that they wear a mask and keep socially distanced.\nTravel Restrictions to Fight COVID-19\nTrump falsely said that Biden had opposed the travel restrictions the president imposed on China on Jan. 31 in an effort to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. Biden did not say he opposed them at the time. And he later said he endorsed them.\nTrump also said that if he had listened to Biden and not imposed the restrictions, millions of Americans would have died rather than 200,000. There is no evidence to support the claim that the travel restrictions saved so many lives.\nTrump: If we would have listened to you, the country would have been left wide open. Millions of people would have died, not 200,000.  I closed it and you said hes xenophobic, hes a racist and hes xenophobic. Because you didnt think we should have closed our country.\nAs we have written, Bidens campaign said on April 3 that Biden backed Trumps decision to impose travel restrictions on China. Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy, Kate Bedingfield, Bidens deputy campaign manager, told CNN. Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.\nTrump has frequently said, as he did at the debate, that Biden called him xenophobic for imposing the restrictions. Trump is right that Biden called him xenophobic. But Biden didnt make clear why he said that. The Biden campaign has said that was not in connection with the China travel restrictions.\nAs we have written, on the day the White House announced the restrictions, Biden said at a campaign event in Iowa that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. He added, This is no time for Donald Trumps record of hysteria and xenophobia  hysterical xenophobia  and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science. The Biden campaign said Bidens reference to xenophobia was about Trumps long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China, and that he was not talking about the travel rules.\nAs for whether the restrictions saved millions of lives, as we reported, there is no evidence to support this, and the White House has provided none. The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases, but do little to contain them.\nFinally, Trump didnt close the country. The restrictions, which went into effect Feb. 2, barred certain non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the United States. But U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their immediate families were exempt from the restrictions.\nA New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the restrictions went into effect. So this was hardly a closure.\nNuking Hurricanes?\nBiden said that Trump has an answer for hurricanes, he said maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them. The president shot back, I never said that at all. He made it up.\nThe back story: Axios reported on April 25, 2019, that Trump had proposed just that. Its story said, President Trump has suggested multiple times to senior Homeland Security and national security officials that they explore using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes from hitting the United States, according to sources who have heard the presidents private remarks and been briefed on a National Security Council memorandum that recorded those comments.\nTrump denounced the story in a tweet at the time as FAKE NEWS.\nOne of the storys authors, Jonathan Swan, tweeted back that he stood by the story, adding that the president said this in at least two meetings during the first year and a bit of the presidency, and one of the conversations was memorialized.\nThe issue has not been authoritatively settled.\nTrade Deficit with China\nFuel Economy Standards\nWhen Wallace asked Trump why he had relaxed fuel economy standards for vehicles that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks, Trump responded, Well, not really, because whats happening is that the car is much less expensive and its a much safer car and youre talking about a tiny difference.\nAnd then what would happen, because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased, he added. We have the old slugs out there, that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper, by $3,500.\nTrump is referring to his administrations Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles rule, which replaced the Obama administrations stricter set of fuel economy standards. At the core of the policy is the idea that by reducing fuel standards, that would make new cars cheaper, allowing people to replace older and potentially less safe vehicles.\nBut as weve explained before, the administrations analyses that underpinned that argument were widely viewed as faulty and contrary to the basic principles of economics.\nTrumps $3,500 figure is incorrect, even by the administrations own analysis. According to the final rule, which calls for increasing fuel efficiency by 1.5% every year instead of 5%, the cost of a new vehicle is estimated to be $977 to $1,083 lower, on average  a good deal less than $3,500.', 'description': 'In a chaotic debate with plenty of crosstalk, there was also plenty to fact-check.', 'source_domain': 'www.factcheck.org'}]","[{'entity': 'B-PER', 'word': 'Floyd'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.factcheck.org'], 'dates': ['2020-09-30T08:52:30'], 'languages': ['']}",1
Lamar preforming in 2013.,0,1,4,6.356314659118652,"[{'title': 'Which songs will Kendrick Lamar perform during the Super Bowl LIX halftime show?', 'date': '2024-11-27T10:00:32', 'content': 'Kendrick Lamar said on his new album GNX that Nas congratulated him for being selected to perform at halftime of Super Bowl LIX in February.\nPerhaps Nas will make a guest appearance on stage in New Orleans?\nIts hard to predict what Lamar will do with his upcoming performance  or with his music in general. He caught the music world by surprise in releasing his latest album on Friday, then releasing a video for the song squabble up on Monday.\nThe release of GNX gives fans a glimpse into additional songs that might be performed at Caesars Superdome in February. The Athletic in September rolled out early predictions and odds of the songs the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper would perform during the Super Bowl halftime show. Here are updated predictions, which include some of the tracks from the new album:\nNot Like Us\nWhen this song, considered by many as the knockout punch in the Kendrick Lamar-Drake rap beef, was released in May, rapper-turned-podcaster Joe Budden said Drake should be thankful it wasnt the HBCU band season because it would be played at games repeatedly. Well, college football season is here, and marching bands are performing their renditions of the song. Pro teams are playing the song. Youth bands are picking up the song. It even became a theme for the Los Angeles Dodgers during their run to the World Series. Its the new sports theme for this decade: They not like us. They not like us. They not like us.\nChance its played: 100 percent\nsquabble up\nWhen the Not Like Us video was released on July 4, there was a snippet of a song at the start of the video. The snippet had no title. That song turned out to be squabble up from the new album. The up-tempo start and the sample of Debbie Debs When I Hear Music is an ideal choice.\nChance its played: 99 percent\nLike That\nThis song, featuring Future and Metro Boomin, reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lamar said in his verse theres no big three in rap, declaring himself above Drake and J. Cole.\nChance its played: 95 percent\nHumble\nThe NBA used this track as its theme for the 2017 NBA Finals. Its one of Lamars most recognizable songs. Its hard to imagine it doesnt make it into the show. If it doesnt make the cut, GNX tracks might be the reason.\nChance its played: 90 percent\ntv off\nLefty Gunplay joins Lamar in this high-energy song off the GNX album. Lamar screaming Mustarrrrrrd! in reference to producer DJ Mustard quickly has become a meme-worthy expression. At the very least, Lamar has to yell Mustarrrrrrd! at least once during his performance.\nChance its played: 85 percent\nMoney Trees\nThis song includes Jay Rock, as the two once were labelmates at Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Listen to heart pt. 6 from GNX and be reminded how much Jay Rock means to Lamars career. It would be a great moment on stage for a reunion.\nChance its played: 75 percent\nDNA\nThis is one of Lamars biggest songs. Itll be hard to imagine its not part of the show.\nChance its played: 75 percent\nAll the Stars\nLamar teamed up with SZA for this song on the Black Panther soundtrack. Lamar is no longer on TDE, but he remains close with those on the label. SZA would add soul as a guest performer.\nChance its played: 65 percent\nSwimming Pools (Drank)\nIts a slower tempo, but its a great song in a concert setting. It also was the song that introduced many fans to Lamars Good Kid, M.A.A.D City album in 2012.\nChance its played: 60 percent\nKing Kunta\nThis is one of Lamars more danceable tracks from his To Pimp a Butterfly album from 2015. Its a perfect concert song  but will it fit in his Super Bowl rotation?\nChance its played: 60 percent\nFamily Ties\nLamar joined his cousin, Baby Keem, on this song off Keems The Melodic Blue album. Keem has toured with Lamar, so it wouldnt be surprising for them to be on stage together in New Orleans.\nChance its played: 60 percent\nAlright\nLamar performed this at Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium when he was part of Dr. Dres halftime show. Thats the only thing that makes it dicey as to whether itll be part of the upcoming show.\nChance its played: 50 percent\nCollard Greens\nThis was a highlight of ScHoolboy Qs Oxymoron album. Its an up-tempo song and would be another opportunity for Lamar to bring one of his former TDE labelmates onto the biggest of stages with him.\nChance its played: 45 percent\nRich Spirit\nIve heard this song live, and it hits hard in front of a live audience. That doesnt mean it translates to the Super Bowl. Its not a dance song, but its also not a slow jam. Nice, mid-tempo game that could lighten the mood a little, if needed.\nChance its played: 40 percent\nB-, Dont Kill My Vibe\nA popular song, but the NSFW first word of the title means Lamar would have to work around it. Its not impossible, as any song on this stage will have to be cleaned of profanity. There are parts of the song that would work.\nChance its played: 40 percent\nEuphoria\nThis was the first solo diss track from Lamar at Drake.

"President Trump on Thursday visited the southern border in McAllen, Tex.",0,1,7,6.477574348449707,"[{'title': 'Melania Trump makes unannounced visit to Texas border amid crisis over separated families', 'date': '2018-06-21T19:52:00', 'content': 'First lady Melania Trump arrived in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday in an unannounced trip to the border area amid the administration\'s crisis over the separation of families.\nBefore embarking on a tour of Upbring New Hope Children\'s Shelter, which currently houses about 60 migrant children, most of them teenagers, Mrs. Trump thanked the staff and participated in a question-and-answer session with shelter workers while sitting in front of walls papered with colorful children\'s art.\n""I\'m here to learn about the facility to which I know you housed children on a long-term basis,"" she told the group. ""And I also like to ask you how I can help these children reunite with their families as quickly as possible.""\nThe first lady\'s visit offered a distinctly different set of visuals on a crisis that has so far been illustrated by the sights and sounds of children housed in what look like cages and wailing for their parents. The facility Mrs. Trump chose to visit is a small, permanent shelter that opened in 2014 and typically houses children who cross the border without a parent, a group of migrants known as unaccompanied alien children.\nAccording to a senior administration official, six of the 60 children from Honduras and El Salvador housed at that shelter were separated from their parents.\nThe first lady questioned the nonprofit shelter staff over the family status of the children and how frequently they can talk to their parents  twice a week, a staffer told her, once the child\'s parents are confirmed to actually be their parents.\nMrs. Trump had also planned to try and visit a customs and border patrol processing center, but had to cancel because of flooding in the area. A statement from the first lady\'s office said she wanted to ""hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families.""\nA spokesperson told reporters the trip was planned before President Donald Trump ended the policy; the trip was ""100 percent her idea  she absolutely wanted to come.""\nHer two-hour visit came as the Trump administration has tried to spin the family separation crisis in their favor. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new ""zero tolerance"" policy in April that directs authorities to prosecute all instances of illegal border crossings, resulting in thousands of children being separated from their parents or legal guardians in a six-week period. The Trump administration at first maintained that the increasing number of children being separated from their mothers at the U.S. southern border was not a policy of its own making but just a tragic byproduct of enforcing the law against illegal border crossings.\nAmid growing backlash and media reports of the facilities in which the children were being held, the president sought repeatedly to blame ""bad legislation passed by Democrats"" for his policy while claiming Congress alone could fix it.\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed first that there was no family separation policy, then in a White House press briefing Monday blamed Congress for it and argued that family separation was simply a continuation of previous administrations\' policies. That\'s false the Obama administration usually detained children and parents together  but it\'s a defense Trump himself seized on in recent days after being confronted by increasingly angry members of his own party who spoke out against the policy.\nOn Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order halting his administration\'s family separation practice, but did not address where newly arriving families would stay or how the 2,300 children already separated will be reunited with their parents.\n""Our first lady is down now at the border, because it really bothered her to be looking at this and seeing this, as it bothered me,"" Trump said on Thursday at a Cabinet meeting, before complaining that the crisis was the fault of Democratic lawmakers who ""don\'t care about the children.""\nThe president cited his wife and daughter on Wednesday when signing the executive order on the matter.\n""Ivanka feels very strongly. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it. We don\'t like to see families separated. At the same time, we don\'t want people coming into our country illegally. This takes care of the problem,"" he said. He did not mention that an executive order wasn\'t needed to end the practice, as the Department of Justice had begun implementing the policy without one.\nMrs. Trump waded into the controversy on Sunday, releasing a rare statement hours before Laura Bush and the other living former first ladies  Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama  weighed in on the issue, too.\n""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,"" according to a statement from her spokeswoman. ""She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.""\nThe president said Thursday he would direct agencies to reunite families who had been separated under his administration\'s practice, though the timeline for that is still unclear. The executive order issued Wednesday suggested the government intends to detain whole families together in the future.\nHouse Republicans have been working on two bills meant to address the immigration issues Trump has said need fixing. On Thursday, members voted down a conservative immigration bill, and GOP leaders postponed the vote on a compromise measure originally scheduled for later in the day.\nMembers rejected legislation authored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and favored by conservatives that would have authorized  but not appropriated  government funding for a border wall. It also would not have provided a pathway to citizenship for those eligible under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\nThe vote on the compromise measure had been slated for early Thursday evening, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that vote had been postponed until Friday to give members more time to review the legislation.', 'description': 'Her visit comes as the Trump administration tries to spin the end of the family separation policy  which his administration created  in their favor.', 'source_domain': 'www.nbcnews.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-PER', 'word': 'Trump'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'M'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##c'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##llen'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Tex'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.nbcnews.com'], 'dates': ['2018-06-21T19:52:00'], 'languages': ['']}",1
"Children in Oak Ridge, in the US state of Tennessee, hold newspapers declaring the end of the war",0,1,4,7.293209791183472,"[{'title': 'The Prophets of Oak Ridge', 'date': '2013-09-13T00:00:00', 'content': 'Last summer, in the dead of night, three peace activists penetrated the exterior of Y-12 in Tennessee, supposedly one of the most secure nuclear-weapons facilities in the United States. A drifter, an 82-year-old nun and a house painter. They face trial next week on charges that fall under the sabotage section of the U.S. criminal code. And if they had been terrorists armed with explosives, intent on mass destruction? That nightmare scenario underlies the governments response to the intrusion. This is the story of two competing worldviews, of conscience vs. court, of fantasy vs. reality, of history vs. the future.\nChapter 1\nMission\nThe devil was just over Pine Ridge.\nFrom the deserted parking lot on the edge of town, the three servants of God looked into darkness.\nThey clicked on their flashlights, pushed through the initial thicket of brush and began their trek, aiming for the black wooded slope.\nFirst, the house painter: bearded, calm, quiet.\nSecond, the Catholic nun: gentle, grandmotherly, short of breath.\nThird, the drifter: alert, intense, shouldering supplies.\nThey crept across the marshy field, led by some combination of God and Google Maps. Behind them was the city of Oak Ridge, Tenn., 30 minutes west of Knoxville. On the other side of Pine Ridge was Bear Creek Valley  cradle of the Y-12 National Security Complex, the Fort Knox of Uranium, birthplace of the heart of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima 67 years earlier.\nIt was, the house painter would later recall, as if the Almighty were guiding each step, across 1,000 feet of open field and up an embankment.\nBy 3 a.m. on Saturday, July 28, 2012, two career peace activists, with eight years jail time between them, and an 82-year-old nun had reached the first obstacle in their two-hour, one-mile hike toward one of the countrys most secure nuclear facilities.\nA six-foot chain-link boundary fence bordered a gravel patrol road. Strung along the fence were yellow No Trespassing placards threatening a $100,000 fine and up to one year in prison.\nThe house painter gripped a pair of bolt cutters, fixed the jaws around a link and squeezed. He cut links in three lines, then opened the new flap.\nNo alarm. No patrol cars.\nThe nun went through first.\nAfter the two men followed her, they closed the fence with twine, crossed the patrol road and began the 40-degree ascent to the dark crest of the ridge. The crime had started, which meant they were one step closer to justice.\nOne step closer to rattling the Department of Energy.\nOne step closer to assailing the nations storied nuclear identity.\nOne step closer to changing their lives and the lives of the people on the other side of the slope  including the first man they would meet once they cut through three more fences and entered the kill zone.\nChapter 2\n and the earth will shake\nIn those same woods, around 1900, a middle-aged ascetic named John Hendrix gazed up at the sky and heard a voice like a clap of thunder.\nThe voice told Hendrix to sleep in the woods for 40 nights. So he did. And he had a vision of the future, according to The Oak Ridge Story, a 1950 book by George O. Robinson Jr.\nAnd I tell you, Hendrix said to his farming community after his retreat, Bear Creek Valley some day will be filled with great buildings and factories and they will help toward winning the greatest war that ever will be. . . . They will be building things and there will be great noise and confusion and the earth will shake.\nHendrix often summited Pine Ridge, Robinson wrote, to pray over the vista of peach orchards and log cabins.\nIve seen it, was his refrain. Its coming.\nOn Nov. 11, 1942, decades after Hendrixs death, a letter from the government arrived at the home of his son: The War Department intends to take possession of your farm Dec. 1, 1942. . . . Your fullest cooperation will be a material aid to the War Effort.\nThe government paid Curtis Allen Hendrix $850 for his 60-acre farm, which would be overtaken by the Manhattan Project, the countrys race to build an atomic bomb before Hitler did. Three thousand homesteaders were displaced by the government, which then built a city from scratch by laying 200 miles of road, constructing 44,000 dwelling units and importing 75,000 workers: steelmen from Pennsylvania, machinists and woodworkers from Michigan, riveters and physicists and stenographers and chemists from coast to coast. The 14-square-mile Secret City of Oak Ridge was forested with billboards that said Keep mum about this job and We will win in 44 with your help.\nScores of East Tennessee high school girls were trained to operate the dials on complex machinery at the Y-12 site. They didnt know that each flick of their wrists aided the gram-by-gram production of U-235, the uranium isotope that can sustain the chain reaction of fission necessary to create a nuclear explosion.\nThe science seems simple enough: When a neutron strikes the nucleus of a U-235 atom, the nucleus splits and releases thermal energy and more neutrons, which in turn strike and split more uranium nuclei, and on and on, in an instant, until . . .\nThe biggest boom, from the smallest of particles.\nAround the clock for 18 months, the Secret City hummed and hustled. Hendrix, his vision borne out, was posthumously deemed the Prophet of Oak Ridge. For most townspeople, the full nature of their mission became clear only in bold newspaper ink on Aug. 6, 1945.\nATOMIC SUPER-BOMB, MADE AT OAK RIDGE, STRIKES JAPAN, announced the Knoxville News-Sentinel.\nChapter 3\nSabotage\nIt was into this land and history that outsiders intruded 67 years later: Sister Megan Gillespie Rice, now 83; drifter Michael Robin Walli, now 64; and house painter Gregory Irwin Boertje-Obed, 57.\nThey, like Hendrix, had a vision.\nThey, like Hendrix, can come off a little batty.\nMichael, though fiercely intelligent, often departs on tirades about the Antichrist.\nSister Megan, adamant about not harming any living thing, vowed that if they were attacked by guard dogs inside the complex she would not even raise her hands in self-defense.\nGreg is so meek in demeanor that its hard to imagine him wielding cutlery, let alone bolt cutters.\nHendrix envisioned the improbable construction of a wartime city.\nMichael, Sister Megan and Greg envision its improbable dismantlement.\nWith elbow grease and blind faith, they would make a symbolic incursion to defeat the sites $150 million-a-year security operation. They would mortify the nations nuclear weapons programs, which since 1940 has cost at least $9.8 trillion in 2013 dollars  costlier than all other government expenditures except Social Security and non-nuclear defense programs, according to nuclear weapons policy analyst Stephen Schwartzs recent update of his 1998 Brookings Institution audit.\nIn short: Nuclear weapons have been the United States third-highest national priority since World War II, in terms of dollars, and we spend a fortune every year to manage and secure them. Yet a crucial facility in this nuclear enterprise wasnt even nun-proofed, much less terrorist-proofed, as a Tennessee congressman would put it in a February hearing on the break-in, which shut down Y-12 site operations for two weeks.\nThis is how Congress describes the intrusion and fallout: Embarrassing. Astonishing. Unprecedented.\nThis is how Greg, Michael and Sister Megan describe it: Gods will. Victory. A miracle. Another step toward the eradication of immoral weapons.\nWhen superimposed on the small-town history of Oak Ridge or the quotidian mechanics of federal Washington, their anti-nuclear beliefs can look heroic or treasonous. Nuclear bombs are existential weaponry. They ignite existential debates. Paradoxes proliferate. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, sometimes unclear at first.\nSometimes one must step away from lawfulness in the service of a greater good.\nSometimes the very thing that keeps us safe is the one thing that can exterminate us.\nSometimes we bargain over the lesser of two evils.\nWhat is unambiguous: The nun, the drifter and the house painter have been charged with two felonies whose combined maximum sentence is 30 years in prison. One of these felonies is rarely leveled against civilians: intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of the United States, as written under the Sabotage chapter of the U.S. Code.\nTheir jury trial is scheduled to begin May 7 in Knoxville.\nThe defendants do not view it as their trial, even though they proudly admit to trespassing and damaging government property. By exposing what they believe to be the fallacy of national security, by smuggling their anti-war message into the judicial system through the back door, they believe they are putting the country on trial.\nChapter 4\nThe summit\nThe nun plodded up the steep and densely wooded ridge.\nIn front of her was the painter, behind her the drifter and the boundary fence. Pathless, they snaked slowly in wide turns to ease the climb, pausing often so she could catch her breath.\nThe Holy Spirit directs a person to what is right and what is possible, the nun thought, and this was possible.\nHer parents taught her that life is about moving toward ones purpose. She had been working her way toward this climb since the age of 9, when she learned her familys next-door neighbor in New York City was a Columbia University biophysicist privy to the secret Manhattan project.\nShe remembers Pearl Harbor and covering her eyes when the newsreels played war footage before matinees at Trans-Lux movie theaters in Manhattan.\nShe remembers her obstetrician father, who spoke of impoverished patients at Bellevue Hospital; her mother, whose PhD thesis explored the Catholic opinion on slavery; and her uncle, Walter Hooke, a Marine who was yoked with the terrible weight of knowing after surveying the decimation of Nagasaki, where all that survived in the citys cathedral was a scorched wood statue of the Virgin Mary.\nShe remembers committing as a teenager to the teaching order Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus because of their work in Africa, and learning at Boston College how radioactivity affects human cells.\nThe servants of God stopped to rest.\nA dog barked in the distance. From town? From over the ridge?\nShe had known danger. Kneeling down to block traffic at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site in the 80s.\nShe had known hardship. Sleeping in classrooms in rural east Nigeria. No running water, no electricity.\nShe had known Sister Anne Montgomery, who, in 2009 at 83, broke into Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, which harbors nuclear submarines, and was convicted, with four others, of trespassing and damaging federal property.\nHow can I get involved? Sister Megan asked Sister Anne after the trial.\nCall Greg Boertje-Obed, Sister Anne said.\nAnd now there she was, an old lady in sturdy shoes, reaching the limits of her mortal energy at the top of Pine Ridge with Greg, about 90 minutes into the mission. There was the vista over which the Prophet of Oak Ridge had prayed more than a century before, where a national security complex now winked in the darkness.\nThere was still a slope to descend, and three more fences to cut through. The plan was to hike along the ridge, breach the fences away from the facilitys guard towers and then walk casually toward the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility, which houses the nations cache of highly enriched uranium  an estimated 400 tons of it, racked in cans floor-to-ceiling across 110,000 square feet.\nInside the building was enough radioactive material to fuel over 10,000 nuclear bombs, which would end civilization many times over.\nSister Megan was tired and fading with the night, so they recalibrated.\nThey started down the slope immediately.\nOnce clear of the trees, they would head for the first building they saw.\nChapter 5\nThe belly of the beast\nMission planning involved searching the Bible and the Internet.\nAll of the relevant information on Y-12s layout was available online. All of the relevant motivation was available in the books of Psalms, Proverbs and Isaiah.\nThe Y-12 break-in is the latest Plowshares disarmament action, a tradition of symbolic and intrepid civil resistance dating to September 1980, when the Berrigan brothers and six others hammered on Minutemen missiles and poured blood on documents at the General Electric weapons plant in King of Prussia, Pa. The Plowshares activists take their name and inspiration from Isaiah 2:4, a verse prophesying a world without war.\nA parade of actions, each with its own name, has followed over the years. The Dorothy Day Catholic Worker house in Petworth is home to several Plowshares alumni, including Michael, and a home away from home to Sister Megan, who resides in her orders residence on Newton Street NE. (Greg lives with his wife and daughter in Duluth, Minn.)\nIn the context of Plowshares history, the July action was both typical and astounding, says Paul Magno, a Plowshares veteran and a leader of D.C. nonprofit Witness for Peace.\nTo me, it goes to not only the over-hype, the over-sell of the whole security mythology, but it goes to what you can do with an act of faith, Magno says. Gods people can be faithful and the Red Sea parts and lets them through when theres no reason to believe that should be possible.\nThe action last summer was dubbed Transform Now Plowshares because its three participants desire the immediate conversion of all nuclear weaponry from agents of war to resources that benefit mankind.\nMichael and Sister Megan live in the world as they believe it should be, not in the world as it is.\nSister Megan doesnt vote.\nIt would mean I would be a citizen of this regime. I am a citizen of the world. I act in consequence.\nMichael derides Washington as the belly of the beast.\nDid you know that the last president who wasnt a war criminal was Herbert Hoover?\nSays Sister Megan of Michael: His mind is never still.\nSays Michael of Sister Megan: Shes a visionary.\nTogether theyre like an overactive younger brother and patient older sister. Michael summons the brimstone, Sister Megan the bromide.\nWhen she and Michael retell their story, which they do often to eager foot soldiers of social justice groups, they put it in tidy parable form on PowerPoint: We saw injustice at Y-12, so we broke in to bring truth and attract the worlds attention, and here is the U.S. governments seven-decade budget for nuclear-weapons infrastructure. After one such presentation, at the weekly Clarification of Thought at the Dorothy Day house, a visitor asks about the forces they faced once they made it through the final fence that summer night.\nThe first person to really lose his job was this lovely security guard, says Sister Megan, adding that she hopes to meet him when she, Greg and Michael go to Knoxville for a pre-trial hearing on whether they can offer moral conviction as a defense in court.\nChapter 6\nThe descent\nThe lights of the Antichrist flickered through the trees.\nThe drifter prayed.\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace. For all the glory is yours, and on the last day Jesus will come like this, like a thief in the night, and the warmongering United States will fulfill Isaiahs prophecy by beating its swords into plowshares.\nHe had duct-taped the head of his flashlight to reduce the beam to a sliver. On the downward slope of Pine Ridge, he moved in front of the nun, clearing branches and stones from her path. He was just a frail earthen vessel, he believed, but she was a daughter of God. He was her bodyguard.\nOn his head was a construction hat painted light blue, with UN marked on the front. On his breath was the stink of Top brand tobacco. In their backpacks, he and the nun carried twine, matches, candles, a Bible, three hammers, six cans of spray paint, three protest banners, copies of a letter they wished to deliver to Y-12 employees and two emblems of sustenance  a packet of cucumber seeds and a fresh-baked loaf of bread with a cross molded into the top.\nAnd six baby bottles of human blood.\nThis was easy compared with Vietnam, where he carried briefing boards of heavy hinged plywood out of Phuoc Long province during the Cambodia incursion. Michael was an Army specialist, an expert marksman with an M-14 and M-16. The carpet-bombing from American B-52s still echoes in his head.\nLike thunder, but it didnt stop.\nHe earned a Bronze Star.\nHe considers himself a war criminal.\nHe left the Army after two tours, found Jesus, became an ascetic, worked in a homeless shelter in Chicago, stormed the gates of the CIA with 1,500 other activists in April 1987, wound up in Fairfax Countys jail and decided to stay in Washington upon his release.\nAnd now, 45 years after his enlistment, he was at the edge of the woods on the other side of Pine Ridge, the flood-lit expanse of Y-12 in front of him.\nAs predicted long ago, the valley was filled with great buildings, many rusted and dating to the Manhattan Project. But right in front of them was a vast, new fortress of reinforced concrete with a foundation anchored in bedrock.\nAs luck, or providence, would have it, this was their original target: the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility, a large part of Y-12s mission to reduce its physical footprint, improve its safety and modernize its operations.\nFrom the treeline, they watched a patrol SUV pass one way on Bear Creek Road, then the other. Then they walked across the two lanes and approached the first of three eight-foot chain-link fences. This outer fence, with three lines of barbed wire on top, was part of Y-12s perimeter intrusion detection and assessment system.\nIt was no match for bolt cutters.\nThe house painter began cutting links in the first fence near a sign that said Danger: Halt! Deadly force is authorized beyond this point.\nSomewhere on the site, according to the Knoxville News-Sentinels nuclear reporter Frank Munger, were Gatling guns capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute  a fusillade that could reduce a trespasser to pink mist.\nThe painter pulled back the flap of chain links like a curtain.\nThe nun entered the kill zone first.\nChapter 7\nThe Secret City\nNestled in a river valley, Oak Ridge looks unremarkable on the surface. Its old town square has been overtaken by a congested turnpike lined with fast food joints, credit unions and parking lots. Cul-de-sacs of single-family homes unfurl up the foggy foothills of the Smoky Mountains.\nRoads are named Hickory, Poplar and Whippoorwill, and Manhattan, Palladium and Boeing. Flagpoles clang. The Panera is always packed. Locals pronounce their city Oh-kridge.\nOn a knoll on the front lawn of St. Marys Catholic Church, a six-foot marble statue of the Virgin Mary gazes southward over the low-rise downtown, toward Pine Ridge. Her face shaded by dark green mold, the Virgin stands barefoot on a spheroid plinth that represents Earth. This Mary, like most Marys, has her foot on a serpent, but theres a curious non-biblical icon on the Earth under her toes: a nucleus framed by a whirl of electrons.\nThe atomic symbol is on the facade of the public high school. It is rendered in stained glass inside the public library. It is on the big green sign that heralds the Y-12 National Security Complex just over Pine Ridge.\nAt noon on the first Wednesday of every month, the DOE tests its public-warning sirens for three minutes. Every June, reenactors stage the Allied invasion of Normandy in the town park.\nThough you havent needed a badge to get into the town since 1949, Oak Ridges soul hasnt changed. Its still a company town, and the company is the government, and the business is bombs.\nIts centerpiece, Y-12, has become a large processing shop and warehouse for most of the countrys highly enriched uranium. Its one of five production sites connected to three research labs under the umbrella of the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semi-autonomous entity within the Department of Energy created in the year 2000 to manage and secure nuclear weapons and non-proliferation programs.\nY-12 processes highly enriched uranium for a variety of purposes, including life-extension programs for three classes of warheads and the B61 bomb. The renovation of these weapons programs could take 25 years, officials estimate, and cost $20 billion. The site also dismantles weapons components and downblends the highly enriched uranium, reducing its radioactivity for use in research and nuclear reactors.\nWeapons, war and secrecy are the citys economy, its legacy and, for now, its future. Concrete guard stations from the early 1950s lurk on the roadsides. A commemorative walk salutes the 43ers  those thousands of people who moved to Oak Ridge at the governments behest in 1943. One plaque says residents work made possible a weapon that was instrumental in bringing peace to a world anguished by the brutal six-year war in which 54 million people died.\nThe activists of Transform Now Plowshares are in West Knoxville in early February, at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, testifying to the congregation after a Sunday service. Church members ask them how they can claim nonviolence when they destroyed property.\nMaybe the triviality of that destruction comes from a truth that is monstrous, Sister Megan says. Those very fences are illegal, and guarding lies and secrecy and corruption and great danger to the world.\nWhite-haired Lillian Mashburn stands, arms crossed, in the back of the church. Shes thinking of her father, who was an infantryman stationed in the Pacific when Oak Ridges uranium fell toward Hiroshima.\nHe was saved by that bomb, Mashburn, a church board member, says after the discussion. They were told when they landed they would be killed as part of the first wave. . . . Theres a whole generation of people, most of whom wouldve been dead, who were saved.\nWhat saves Oak Ridge are the dollars that gush from Washington to East Tennessee.\nThe complex is the second-largest employer in East Tennessee and creates 24,000 indirect jobs, according to the site contractors Y-12 Community Relations Council. Eight thousand people go to work there, including contractors, subcontractors, protective-force guards and 80 federal employees of the Department of Energy. For 2014, $1.2 billion was requested by the NNSA for the management and operation of Y-12.\nY-12 is slated to construct a new Uranium Processing Facility, a massive building that will ensure that Americas nuclear arsenal remains operational. Peak construction of the UPF will create 1,500 construction jobs and 5,000 support jobs.\nThis community serves the DOE, says Ralph Hutchison, 56, the coordinator of the nonprofit Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, whose ultimate goal is to abolish nuclear weapons, which means halting operations at Y-12. Its the environment in which they live. Its the air they breathe.\nChapter 8\nThe miracle\nThe trio stood in a moat of white rocks between the first and second fence.\nThe complex was lit bright as day.\nNo one was racing to apprehend them.\nThe middle fence was intimidating, and wired for something.\nMotion sensoring?\nElectricity?\nThis is not going to work, the house painter thought. We are not going to get through this.\nHe had known doubt before. Greg was a Presbyterian Iowa farm boy who joined the ROTC to afford Tulane University. He went into active duty at Fort Polk in 1981, as the nuclear-freeze movement rallied against President Ronald Reagans stockpile buildup. He read Daniel Berrigan.\nHis government said: Be ready for nuclear war.\nThe prophet Isaiah said: Do not put your trust in horses and chariots.\nHe couldnt reconcile the two. He left the Army as a conscientious objector, he says, and returned to New Orleans in time to hear Berrigan talk about Plowshares actions.\nGreg heard an inner voice say, Go in this direction.\nWithin two years, he was living at Jonah House, the Catholic Worker residence in Baltimore, where he met his wife, Michele. While raising their daughter, they scheduled their protests to make sure that only one of them was facing jail at any given time. His first action was hammering Trident II missile tubes at Quonset Point shipyard in Rhode Island.\nTwenty-six years later, a nun would call him up, looking to make her own first action.\nAnd now this middle fence, and the possibility that their mission was over. Surely security cameras had spied them by now. Surely this fence would trip an alarm.\nYou wont know unless you try, the inner voice told him.\nHe began cutting links in the middle fence, severing fiber-optic sensors.\nNo one came for them.\nThis is grace, he thought, and he climbed through after the others.\nHe cut through the last fence, and they were through the Red Sea, and there was nothing between them and the Fort Knox of Uranium.\nGod is with us, he thought. This is a miracle.\nThey shook cans of red and black spray paint.\nThey gripped the baby bottles of blood.\nThey spray painted the buildings north wall, which was designed to withstand the impact of aircraft but not the words of the Book of Proverbs. They poured and splashed blood that had once been in the veins of a painter-activist named Tom Lewis, one of the Catonsville Nine who, on Hiroshima Day 1987, hammered on the bomb racks of an anti-submarine plane at the South Weymouth Naval Air Station near Boston. In 2008, Lewis died in his sleep, and his blood was frozen so that he might one day participate in one last Plowshares action.\nIn bright red rivulets, the last of Tom Lewis streaked down the concrete.\nThey removed the hammers from the drifters backpack. TRANSFORM NOW was written in red marker on the handle of the claw hammer. Burned into the handle of the small sledge hammer was Repent! Gods kingdom is at hand!\nThey began to strike the pentagonal base of a guard tower at the northwest corner of the building. Chips of concrete fell to the asphalt. Blood dribbled into the scar.\nThey believed they were also hammering on what had not yet been built. The wide open space to the right of the tower was designated for the Uranium Processing Facility, now projected to cost at least $6.5 billion, a stockpile of money that they wanted spent on life-extension programs for people.\nThey rang their hammers down on the senselessness of it all.\nThey waited to be arrested.\nIn a matter of minutes, a single guard would be sent to investigate.\nChapter 9\nThe quantum theory of physics\nGreg is prepping baked potatoes.\nSister Megan is setting silverware.\nMichael is carrying armloads of firewood in from outside.\nThey are gathering for a dinner of salmon, tofu and broccoli with a couple of other members of the Transform Now Plowshares support group at a supporters house in south Knoxville. From this home base, in the days before their February pretrial hearing, they bring their anti-bomb evangel to various settings.\nAt the University of Tennessee, where they are guest speakers in a systems theory class, Greg talks about the diffusion of social responsibility and how he feels personally responsible for nuclear weapons because his taxes have paid for them. Michael, who is wearing a T-shirt that says GROUND THE DRONES, calls Y-12 a failed rogue terrorist state.\nI think theres a deafening silence about whats going on at Y-12, says student Rochelle Butler, but I do know people who work there are good people. Why would I believe outsiders rather than people who work there, who I believe to be good?\nWe love these people in a deeply compassionate way, Sister Megan says of the Y-12 employees. Our motivation was in solidarity with people who spend their time making nuclear bombs to feed their children. . . . We are all so intertwined and empower each other. A thought creates its own energy. The quantum theory of physics is always at work.\nThe theory is at work a couple of days later at Maryville College, where the trio eats pizza with 15 students from a progressive Christian group. They are each connected to 50 others, Sister Megan whispers before chatting with music student Chris Hickman.\nI know nothing about the anti-nuclear movement, Hickman tells her. I was born in 92, and its kind of an afterthought for my generation.\nGreg, Michael and Sister Megan visit with two dozen people at a meeting of the Presbyterian Peacemaking Committee of East Tennessee.\nPrince of Peace, we thank you for your prophets whove spoken your word down through the ages, and we thank you for the prophets among us, says host Scott Brunger during his opening prayer.\nThe attendees chat about the fallout from the break-in. Someone asks about what their intrusion has cost taxpayers  at least $15 million in security alterations by the NNSA, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel  and Greg says that they saved taxpayers $12.2 million that was docked from the management contractors award fee. Sister Megan again brings up the first guard they encountered inside the facility and how he lost his job. She says how he saved their lives by not escalating the situation.\nI feel very guilty not contacting him, Sister Megan admits.\nThe guards number is listed.\nHell answer the phone if you call.\nAnd when you ask about the three people who broke into Y-12 last summer, you can almost hear his grip on the phone tighten as he says: You mean the people who ruined my life?\nChapter 10\nIve served my country\nTwo weeks after the break-in, Kirk Garland was handed a letter from the sites protective-force contractor that said he failed in his responsibilities as a guard on the morning of July 28, 2012. The letter said he showed blatant disregard for the seriousness of the situation. It said he was terminated, effective immediately, and his health insurance would expire two days later.\nA solid man with a cinnamon-colored mustache, Kirk started working in nuclear security in 1983 at Colorados now-shuttered Rocky Flats Plant, which processed plutonium for weapons. For three years, he worked in a similar job at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Tex., where nuclear weapons are put together and taken apart. Then he moved to Y-12, where the fuel is processed.\nWhat Oak Ridge built, he says, he was proud to protect.\nIn my eyes, after being a guard for 30 years, I feel that I should be treated the same way as somebody who served in Iraq, says Kirk, 52. Ive served my country for 30 years by protecting my nations nuclear assets.\nHe was four years from retirement, bringing home $85,000 a year with overtime, with a pristine employment record.\nThe sign on the front door of his modest house says, This property has been determined to be vacant and abandoned. He could rescue it from foreclosure, but doesnt have the money. What he has is a rental home in nearby Clinton, a sick wife, a months worth of losing lottery tickets, a 16-year-old daughter who has curtailed her passion for barrel-racing horses, and a small contingent of German shepherds that he raises to sell to police department K-9 units.\nI do okay, he says, standing in the ransacked backyard of his former home in Lake City, Tenn. My wife dont. She cant come up here. Nothing I can do about it. Thirty years with DOE. And youre looking at everything.\nScattered cinder blocks. Sodden heaps of pink insulation. The kennel hauled off by vandals, the small stable stripped of its roof and most of its siding. It had been a good life in Lake City, 20 miles north of Y-12, where he worked for nearly 5 1/2 years until those people, he says, decided to overexert their First Amendment right.\nThe report on the break-in by the inspector general of the Department of Energy faults Kirk for not pulling his weapon, for not securing the area.\nThe sites management contractor, Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services Y-12, faults him for not immobilizing the intruders and for turning his back while they rummaged through their backpacks.\nThe sites protective-force contractor, WSI-Oak Ridge, faults him for an embarrassing and casual response to the intrusion. NNSA officials were horrified by surveillance video of Kirk first addressing the intruders from his car, instead of immediately jumping out, and for making assumptions about their intent.\nIf he had acted too aggressively, on the other hand, Y-12 might have had a dead nun on its hands.\nKirk says there was no reason to unholster his gun, that it was unsafe for one man to try to cuff three people, that an entire patrol team shouldve been dispatched to a zone with multiple alarms. He had previously dealt with peace protesters at Rocky Flats, which is how he knew that the three trespassers were not dangerous, he says. The blatant disregard, he says, lies elsewhere.\nIn fact, the security camera that watched Zone 63, the area of the trios incursion, had been out of service for six months, according to a subsequent report from the Department of Energys inspector general. At the time of the break-in, there were 56 busted security tools across Y-12, seven broken security cameras surrounding the HEUMF and an average of 2,170 sitewide alarms per day  many caused by wildlife, weather and foliage.\nNone of this was Kirks responsibility.\nIn my eyes theyve ruined my name, Kirk says of the government and its contractors. I worked hard. I mean, I put my family second a lot of times to keep this clearance for 30 years, just to have it jerked out from me like that. . . . I think they were embarrassed that an 82-year-old got in that far. And they used me for their scapegoat. They used me to say, Well, he messed it up. We got rid of him. But I wasnt the problem.\nThe problem, according to a string of reports over the years from the DOEs inspector general and the Government Accountability Office, was a lax security culture and hands-off federal oversight. The problem was a culture of compliance, as opposed to a culture of performance, according to a B&W Y-12s post-mortem of what became known internally as the Security Event. A GAO report released, coincidentally, three days after the break-in admonished the NNSA for cost overruns, mismanagement and an absentee relationship with contractors.\nTo date, Kirk is the only individual to have been fired outright because of the incident. The guards who failed to detect and initiate a proper response to the breach were suspended, and the supervising lieutenant was disciplined. B&W Y-12 removed four managers, allowing the top two to formally retire. Four federal officials with security oversight jobs were reassigned. The leaders of the guard force retired or were reassigned, says Paul Donahue, chief executive of G4S Government Solutions, the parent company of the protective force company, which lost its contract. The management and operations contractor lost $12.2 million of its award incentive fee, and the same firms, with different partners, have bid on a new 10-year contract for both Y-12 and Pantex worth $23 billion.\nKirk has a car repairman dogging him for a $1,000 debt that he cant pay. In March, he took a guard job at a county jail that he says pays $24,000 a year. His case is slated for arbitration this fall through the International Guards Union of America.\nHes reached for his Baptist faith to temper his anger. He attends services at Faith Promise, a massive church on a hill on the outskirts of Oak Ridge. He doesnt understand how law-breaking activists can be inspired by the same God that guides his life down the straight and narrow.\nIve got to sit down and ask a priest, Kirk says. Doing the Lords work is not protesting and getting arrested. You dont get to heaven on your works anyway. You get to heaven on salvation. . . . Gods got a different plan for me. Everything happens in his timing, whenever hes ready to move us along.\nWhen told that Sister Megan thinks he saved her life by not escalating the situation  that, in fact, he was her salvation  Kirk is speechless. His wife is not.\nThats amazing that shed make that kind of statement, scoffs Joann Garland. She is safe  because of him  to be able to go and do what shes doing. . . . The joke of it is they came in Gods name. God does not say to break laws. Sorry. God does not say that.\nChapter 11\nScales of justice\nIf religion gives meaning to the chaos of the cosmos, the law developed alongside to order societys unruliest parts.\nGreg, who represents himself in court, stood behind the microphone and delivered his testimony in monolithic terms.\nSo when you build a nuclear weapon, you are planning and preparing to commit mass murder, he argued in a November pre-trial hearing in Knoxville. You are giving your assent to the killing of civilians.\nIn that precursor episode to The United States of America v. Walli et al, the defense argued that it is illegal for the United States to possess nuclear weapons because their sole purpose is to inflict damage that cannot be contained: Civilians perish en masse, the environment is poisoned for generations and the mere threat of this scenario  even under the guise of deterrence  constitutes imminent harm that cannot be ignored for one more minute, let alone successive generations.\nAfter the defense cited the Geneva and Hague conventions and invoked the Nuremberg principles, the government argued that international treaties do not take precedence over laws Congress enacts to ensure national defense, including nuclear weapons programs. At the notion of complicity to war crimes, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey E. Theodore balked.\nThey say if they didnt act, that they are somehow complicit in this illegality, Theodore argued in November. Well, then, therefore, all the people here who have not acted, not [broken] in to Y-12 to stop the illegal operations there, then . . . theyre complicit in war crimes, I guess, which is . . . a ludicrous argument.\nWilliam Quigley, the defendants pro-bono counsel, told the court his clients should be allowed to testify about their moral imperatives for the break-in.\nThe effort to preclude necessity, international law, nuclear policy, God, conscience, history, who knows the other things  I think its, its inconsistent with our search, our mutual search for the truth, Quigley said.\nAfter Michael, Greg and Sister Megan refused a plea bargain, the government hit them with the more serious charge under the sabotage act. That led Transform Now Plowshares and its support group to Courtroom 3B of U.S. District Court in downtown Knoxville in Feburary, for a second hearing on obstructing the national defense, scheduled between a case of bank robbery and a case of Social Security fraud.\nThat morning, Sister Megan has trouble getting through security.\nAny metal on you, sister? a guard asks during her third run through the metal detector.\nI have titanium in my wrists, the nun says, then gestures to the X-ray machine. Do you wear lead vests standing next to this all day? I think you should.\nThe support group swells to 25 people and fills all rows on the defenses side of the courtroom. Ralph Hutchison and folks from the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance are here.\nAs they await the start of the hearing, the supporters begin singing softly.\nPeace is flo-wing like a riiiii-ver, they warble from their seats. Flo-wing out into the deeeeesert.\nHutchison chuckles. Oh the judge loves it when they sing, he says.\nChapter 12\nReaction\nIn Washington, a congressman asks the nun to please stand up.\nWe want to thank you for pointing out some of the problems in our security, says Rep. Joe L. Barton (R-Tex.).\nAnother congressman expresses a different kind of gratitude.\nThank you for your willingness to focus attention on this nuclear weapons buildup that still exists in our world, says Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and how much we need to do something to reduce it.\nA third congressman is incredulous at the nuns mere presence at this September oversight hearing of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\nWhy are they even here in this hearing room? says Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.). Why are they not being held in  in detention somewhere?\nSince July 28, Congress has been sputtering with indignation. Hearings were scheduled on Sept. 12 and 13, Feb. 28 and March 13 so legislators could vocalize how shocked and appalled they are. The phrase wake-up call is uttered and re-uttered. Peace through strength becomes a refrain. The word culture is used 72 times to explain how a complex, highly funded operation could be so vulnerable. Federal officials at the witness table get lost in a maze of their own jargon. Congress members wonder over and over what would have happened if the intruders had been terrorists, not peace activists. Brig. Gen. Sandra Finan, commander of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, appears several times to present her task forces findings on Lessons of the Y-12 Security Failure: NNSA has muddled lines of authority, and its security culture has focused on fiscal limitations over effective performance.\nSister Megan and Michael witness each hearing in sweat pants and parkas. They are lost in the navy thicket of young legislative assistants. On one of these field trips, they get off the Metro at Capitol South station and grimace at the giant Raytheon ads that feature military vehicles and mottos like Any threat, any mission.\nOn Feb. 28, the House Armed Services Committees subcommittee on strategic forces tries to sniff out blame.\nAnd as the chairman correctly pointed out, says Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) at one point, its hard to find that anybody was punished except the lowest-level guard.\nAt a break, Sister Megan approaches one of the expert witnesses, retired Maj. Gen. C. Donald Alston, the former Air Force assistant chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration.\nIll give this to you, she says, handing him a folded sheet of white paper. Its a letter calling for the immediate suspension of funding for the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12.\nThe whole thing can be solved by changing the mission, Sister Megan says to the major general. Change the mission, brother.\nWe have a lot of stability in the world because of nuclear weapons, says Alston, smiling, towering over her in uniform.\nIts impossible to even secure one, Sister Megan says. We can change the mission. Its possible.\nOkay, he says.\nWe can have projects that sustain humanity.\nOkay, he says, starting to leave the witness table.\nThis is the nun, Michael says, coming to her side.\nOh, Alston says, before turning away.\nSister Megan is not concerned with this slight. The world needs positive and negative charges, she says. You cant have energy without both.\nOn March 13, during a second hearing in front of the Energy and Commerces oversight subcommittee, Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) cites a 2010 Department of Energy memo in which Deputy Secretary Daniel B. Poneman called for the elimination of excessive Federal oversight of contractors and the awarding of decision-making authorities to the lowest level of contractor and Federal management.\nThe subcommittee, as a body, wonders if the department had farmed out the stewardship of nuclear assets to contractors who self-police and self-appraise, and therefore continue to collect fees while cutting corners.\nWhat we were trying to do, sir, was to get rid of the check-box mentality of just looking at paperwork and creating paperwork, Poneman replies. To get back to performance testing so we could be better, safer and more secure.\nSitting just over Ponemans shoulder at each one of these hearings are two of the people who have put him on this hot seat for the past eight months.\nI appreciate what you did, a staffer for the Government Accountability Office tells Sister Megan after the hearing adjourns. But dont do it again, because I dont want you to get hurt.\nChapter 13\nA sheet of sun\nThe last shipment of highly enriched uranium bound for Japan left Oak Ridge on July 25, 1945, and arrived two days later on the island of Tinian in the oblivion of the Pacific Ocean. On Aug. 6, a 9,700-pound, 10-foot-long atomic bomb was loaded onto a B-29 bomber, flown 1,500 miles northwest, and dropped over Hiroshima.\nEyes melted from the heads of those who had been looking skyward at the sheet of sun, as John Herseys Hiroshima described the light of the explosion.\nSome 160,000 were dead, dying or injured.\nFive square miles burned.\nA harnessing of the basic power of the universe, President Harry Truman announced.\nOne of the greatest blunders of history, wrote physicist Leo Szilard, an architect of the Manhattan Project.\nWAR ENDS, The Knoxville Journal declared.\nOur national complex was just beginning. The bomb created to stop one war imbued all future wars with apocalyptic power. The United States raced Russia to amass nuclear weapons  a peak of 30,000 stateside in the mid-1960s  then began to reduce the stockpile as other nations pursued and attained nuclear capability.\nThis past January, the Indian government distributed to Kashmiris a nuclear-war advisory that encouraged the building of bunkers.\nIn March, Secretary of State John F. Kerry told ABC News that confrontation becomes more possible if Iran continues its plan to enrich uranium and develop nuclear weaponry.\nIn April, North Korea publicized its desire to strike the United States, and the White House announced that it had helped the Czech Republic remove its entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium  all 150 pounds of it, or enough for two or three nukes.\nThe United States possesses roughly 4,650 active nuclear weapons plus another 3,000 awaiting dismantlement, according to the Federation of American Scientists, a non-partisan think tank created by Manhattan Project scientists. To satisfy the New START Treaty with Russia, our 1,950 strategically deployed high-alert nuclear weapons must be reduced to 1,550 by 2018. In order to get the treaty ratified by the Senate in 2010, President Obama promised $85 billion through 2020 for modernizing the U.S. stockpile.\nIn a time of austerity, our weapons budget is rising as our stockpile is falling.\nThe officials who lay awake at night worrying how to safeguard Cold War leftovers have a delicate, intricate mission fraught with peril and obstacle.\nWe have been running a system a certain way for such a long time and not really thinking about whether it was working or not, says acting NNSA administrator Neile Miller, charged with overseeing the politically choreographed  and therefore incremental  transition from proliferation to disarmament.\nMiller, during an interview in April at the DOE, acknowledges failures in management and says she understands the protester mentality and frustration. But the wish for a nuclear-free world of the future, she says, can distort perception of the policy that guides the world of the present.\nI know people want to believe that everybody here is just of one mind . . . and were all somehow of this military-industrial complex  and it just doesnt work that way, she says.  . . . People tend to be religiously for or religiously against. And as a result, they tend to attribute motivations and actions to all sorts of things that, in my personal experience, so very rarely turn out to be anywhere near whats actually happening.\nOur very national position on nuclear weapons, though, is a paradox.\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, says the administrations 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, the United States will sustain safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces.\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, Sister Megan, Michael, Greg and their fellow activists will hammer on their infrastructure. Incrementalism is the danger, they believe, because the threat is imminent, the consequences are catastrophic and society suffers financially and morally.\nAnd what if these backpack-wearing peaceniks had been terrorists, for whom obtaining highly enriched uranium is the likeliest way to create mass destruction?\nWith those 20 minutes of uninterrupted access to the site, they could have blown through the doors or walls of the HEUMF with an explosively formed penetrator and rigged an improvised nuclear device using highly enriched uranium and conventional explosives. A 10-kiloton detonation at Y-12 would cause an estimated 60,000 casualties, including 18,000 deaths, in East Tennessee. Radiation would have sickened people over 40 miles.\nThis worst-case scenario is presented in a yet-to-be-published report on UPF by the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, which combines a design basis threat scenario from the Department of Energy with a Department of Defense hazard-prediction algorithm employed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit.\nNNSA officials, noting classified security measures inside HEUMF, call this worst-case scenario very, very far-fetched.\nBut then so is a nun breaking into the Fort Knox of Uranium.\nThe intruders who werent terrorists admit to their actions.\nThe legislators have thanked them for initiating security reforms.\nThe deputy secretary of the Department of Energy said in February  during the Nuclear Deterrence Summit in Arlington  that the intrusion, while unacceptable, did not compromise the uranium and therefore did not directly imperil the nation.\nThe Justice Department has charged the trio with intending to do just that.\nSo what is really on trial the second week of May?\nThe limits of the judicial system, or the limits of social-justice actions?\nThe moral arch of the universe versus the bottom line of governance?\nIs it the bargain we strike with ourselves?\nChapter 14\nFission\nIn the late afternoon of Friday, July 27, 2012, the guard drove to Y-12, put on his camouflage uniform, embroidered with Semper Vigil, and holstered a Sig P226 9 mm on his hip.\nOver his 12-hour shift, day became night.\nFor his last two hours, 4 to 6 a.m., he rotated into a patrol vehicle. Around 4:20 a.m., a three-second tone came over his radio  a low-priority alarm that was cleared by an officer in short order. Soon after, the guards cellphone rang.\nThe cleared alarm keeps bouncing back, his supervising lieutenant said; the alarm station was suggesting something is not right in Zone 63, and that a maintenance crew might be at work. The guard was then dispatched to a sector of the security fence that runs around the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility. He arrived there in less than a minute and pulled slowly to the fence in his vehicle. Nothing seemed amiss, until movement caught his eye. He turned his head away from the fence to the HEUMF.\nAn old woman was walking toward his vehicle, a grizzled man on either side. At first he thought it was a painting crew  it wasnt uncommon for maintenance to be done overnight  but behind them were three phrases spray-painted red and black onto the white building.\nTHE FRUIT OF JUSTICE IS PEACE.\nPLOWSHARES PLEASE ISAIAH.\nWOE TO AN EMPIRE OF BLOOD.\nTheir hands were up.\nPeace protesters, he thought, as his phone rang again.\nIt was his lieutenant, checking in.\nIve got three individuals here who have appeared to have breached our system, the guard told him, and theyve written graffiti all over the walls.\nHis lieutenant thought he was kidding.\nIm telling you what I got. Theyre peace protesters. I need backup.\nHe then identified himself through the vehicle window and asked the trio: What are you doing here?\nGod led us here, said one of the men.\nStop where youre at, the guard said, exiting his vehicle.\nThe old woman bowed to him.\nKeep your hands where I can see them.\nWill you listen to our message? she said.\nThe three began to recite text from a white piece of paper.\nBrothers and sisters, powers that be, we come to you today as friends . . .\nThe two men retrieved candles from their backpacks nearby and lit them.\nA loving and compassionate creator invites us to take the urgent and decisive steps to transform the U.S. empire, and this facility, into life-giving alternatives which resolve real problems . . .\nIt would be five minutes before another security officer would show up, brandishing an M-16, ready to help cuff the intruders on the ground as they sang This Little Light of Mine. It would be another two hours until special agents from the Department of Energy arrested the trespassers and mobilized the wheels of justice, and six hours until the trespassers were booked in the Blount County Jail, and one day until the biblical graffiti was scrubbed clean, and 10 days until the three were charged with maliciously attempting to destroy a structure within the Y-12 National Security Complex, and two weeks until the complex reopened and the guard lost his job, and nine months until the trespassers would face trial before a jury of their fellow citizens that would have the power to convict them of intending to endanger the United States.\nBut for those next five minutes the scene was simple, almost sacramental.\nFour servants of God, drawn together by conviction and coincidence, regarded each other as dawn approached.\nThe Lord may have been there.\nThe devil, too.\nOr maybe human beings colliding in the quantum theory of physics was almighty enough.\nChapter 15\nThe Judgment\nNine men and three women step into the jury box, take their seats and face the three defendants. The jurors among them an engineer, a nurse, a social worker, a bus driver and a teacher  had deliberated for just under 2 1/2 hours on May 8, 2013, after hearing two days of testimony and arguments at U.S. District Court in downtown Knoxville, Tenn.\nThey had heard two assistant U.S. attorneys argue that the defendants targeted and intruded onto the nuclear weapons production facility in Oak Ridge in order to disrupt its operations and that such a disruption imperiled national security, which relies on the safety and readiness of the nuclear arsenal.\nThey had heard three defense attorneys argue that their clients never expected to make it as far as they did, that their goal was to promote the cause of disarmament through symbolic action and that their peaceful intrusion actually improved national security by exposing deficiencies at the Y-12 National Security Complex.\nSilent and rapt, supporters of the defendants had watched the proceedings from spectator seating and from an overflow courtroom equipped with a video feed.\nThe day before, the government had called as a witness the man who first encountered the defendants on site.\nWere they passive? defense attorney Christopher Irwin asked during cross-examination.\nThey were passive, Kirk Garland said.\nThe government had also called the top local official for the National Nuclear Security Administration, Steven Erhart, who was used by the attorneys to litigate the final actions of World War II and their reverberating consequences.\nYoud agree that the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed tens of thousands? defense attorney William Quigley had asked Erhart.\nYes, sir, Erhart replied.\nThe same thing would happen if they were dropped on a civilian center here, said Quigley, attempting to set the defendants actions against an infinitely more destructive hypothetical.\nIf used in that manner, yes, sir, Erhart said.\nAfter a lunch break, assistant U.S. attorney Melissa Kirby asked Erhart: What event ended World War II?\nThe events we talked about earlier, Erhart said. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nAnd how many American lives were saved by those events? Kirby asked, prompting murmurs from the courtroom audience.\nIve heard . . . \nObjection, said Francis Lloyd Jr., attorney for the nun. Speculation.\nOn the second day of trial, the defendants each took the stand.\nThe government asked: Do you consider yourself an American?\nThe nun said: I consider myself a citizen of the world.\nThe government asked: Do you believe the United States should disarm even if other countries do not?\nThe house painter said: I believe the U.S. should follow the treaties it has signed.\nThe government asked: Have you ever protested nuclear weapons programs in other countries, like China and Russia?\nThe drifter said: I am indigent, and I blossom where I was planted.\nAt nearly the exact same time that exact same day, on Capitol Hill, the acting administrator of the NNSA called the Y-12 intrusion an important wake-up call.\nThe severity of the failure of leadership at Y-12 has demanded swift, strong and decisive action by the department, Neile Miller told a Senate subcommittee during a hearing on strategic forces. Since the Y-12 incursion, major actions have taken place to improve security immediately, and for the long term.\nSoon after, back in Knoxville, closing arguments began.\nThe government said a shipment of important materials  due at Y-12 the day of the break-in  had to be diverted because of the site closure.\nThe defense attorneys said this secret shipment was a red herring, that their clients were scapegoats for embarrassed officials and greedy contractors.\nTheir whole mission here is to eradicate nuclear weapons, assistant U.S. attorney Jeffrey Theodore told the jury, and the nuclear deterrent is an integral part of our national defense.  Do you excuse what a burglar did because the homeowner was a little lax with security?\nThree senior citizens showing up with backpacks is a threat to the United States of America? defense attorney William Quigley asked rhetorically. That threatens us? I dont think so.  Getting rid of nuclear weapons does not equal an attack on the national defense of the United States.\nWhen the jury retired to deliberate at 3:30 p.m., the defendants and dozens of their supporters gathered in a tight circle in the hallway outside the courtroom.\nPeace is flowing like a river, they sang. In subsequent verses, they substituted truth for peace, then love for truth, then hope for love.\nI thought this was a courthouse, not a church, a nearby bailiff said to himself.\nThen, just before 6 p.m., as the defendants rise to face the jury of their peers, the foreman hands a single sheet of paper to the clerk, who hands it to Judge Amul Thapar, who announces the verdict: Guilty on all counts.\nThe nuns smiling expression does not change. She turns her palms upward, as if to say, This is what will be.\nAs the jury exits the courtroom, single file, supporters sing softly toward them: Love, love, love, love. People, we are made for love.\nAs the defendants are led, one after the other, out a rear door into custody to await a September sentencing of up to 30 years in prison, supporters wipe away tears and call out their gratitude.\nThe drifter is handcuffed  Thank you, Michael!  and then is gone.\nThe house painter gives a wave  Thank you, Greg!  and then is gone.\nThe nun blows a kiss  Thank you, Megan!  and then is gone.\nEpilogue: The prophets are sentenced, the guard declares bankruptcy\nAbout this story.

Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain announced a draft deal on leaving the European Union in November outside 10 Downing Street in London. Support for Brexit has fallen below 50 percent.,0,1,4,7.744245767593384,"[{'title': 'The Theresa May story: The Tory leader brought down by Brexit', 'date': '2019-05-24T09:36:01', 'content': 'Britain\'s second female prime minister, like the first, has ultimately been brought down by Conservative in-fighting over Europe.\nBut Theresa May is unlikely to join Margaret Thatcher in the annals of leaders who left an indelible mark on their country. At least not in the way she might have wanted when she entered Downing Street in July 2016.\nWhatever ambitions she had - to reach out to the forgotten parts of the nation, or correct the ""burning injustices"" in British society - were overshadowed by a single word: Brexit.\nHer almost three years in office were entirely defined by Britain\'s decision to leave the European Union, and her increasingly desperate efforts to deliver on the outcome of the referendum called by her predecessor David Cameron.\nEven her sternest critics had to marvel at her ability to soak up the punishment that came, in wave after wave, from all sides.\nMinisterial resignations and parliamentary rebellions that would have spelled the end for a prime minister in normal times seemed to bounce off her. She ploughed on, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around her, telling MPs ""nothing has changed"" and promising to deliver on the ""will"" of British people, even as her power over Parliament and control of her warring party drained away to nothing.\nIt might have been different had she managed to win the 2017 general election.\nBut instead of returning to Downing Street with a huge mandate of her own, as she had expected, she lost her Commons majority and had to rely on the support of Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party.\nShe never really recovered from this self-inflicted wound, with a sense that many of her MPs were only keeping her in office until she had delivered Brexit before jettisoning her in favour of a more voter-friendly alternative.\nAt one point, she had to promise she would quit before the next scheduled election in 2022, as she battled to win a no-confidence vote organised by her own MPs.\nAnd then, as the end neared - and she had alienated many MPs by blaming them for the deadlock over Brexit - she was forced, finally, to accept that the party, which had never elected her as leader, did not want her to serve any more.\nShe offered her own departure as the final sacrifice to her internal critics, telling them she would stand down if they voted for her EU withdrawal deal.\nA venerable Tory colleague once described Theresa May as a ""bloody difficult woman"".\nShe wore the label as a badge of honour.\nShe was said to have a dry wit in private, but her public persona, even when she was trying to lighten up, could be wooden and forced, and even close colleagues were said to have difficulty working out what she was really thinking.\nHer single-minded, unshowy and diligent approach to politics enabled her to steadily navigate her way to the very top of a party that had traditionally favoured men from more privileged backgrounds than her own when she had first joined it in the late 1970s.\nAnd despite what it must feel like right now, Brexit will not be her only political epitaph.\nWho is Theresa May?\n1 October 1956 (aged 62)\nJobs: MP for Maidenhead since 1997. Became prime minister in 2016 after serving as home secretary for six years.\nEducation: Mainly state-educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School with a brief time at an independent school; St Hugh\'s College, Oxford\nFamily: Married to Philip May\nHobbies: Cooking - she says she owns more than 150 recipe books. Mountain-walking holidays with her husband. On BBC Radio 4\'s Desert Island Discs in 2014, she chose Abba\'s Dancing Queen and Walk Like A Man, from the musical Jersey Boys, among her picks, alongside Mozart and Elgar. She chose a subscription to Vogue as her luxury item, reflecting her lifelong love of high fashion.\nThe daughter of a Church of England vicar, Hubert, who died from injuries sustained in a car crash when she was 25, Mrs May said her father had taught her to ""take people as you find them"" and ""treat everyone equally"".\nBorn in Eastbourne, East Sussex, but raised largely in Oxfordshire, she attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there.\nThe young Theresa Brasier, as she was then, threw herself into village life, taking part in a pantomime that was produced by her father and working in the bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money.\nFriends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who, from an early age, spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister.\nIn 1976, in her third year at Oxford University, she met her husband Philip, who was two years younger than her and president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders.\nThey were introduced at a Conservative Association disco by future Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Both claim it was ""love at first sight"". They married in 1980.\nThere are no tales of drunken student revelry from Mrs May\'s time at Oxford, but friends say she was not the austere figure she would later come to be seen as, suggesting she had a sense of fun and a full social life.\nAfter graduating with a degree in geography, May went to work in the City, initially starting work at the Bank of England and later rising to become head of the European Affairs Unit of the Association for Payment Clearing Services.\nShe first dipped her toe in the political water in 1992, when she stood in the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming a distant second. Her fellow candidates in that contest also included a very youthful Tim Farron, who went on to become a Lib Dem leader.\nTwo years later, she stood in Barking, east London, in a by-election where - with the Conservative government at the height of its unpopularity - she got fewer than 2,000 votes and saw her vote share dip more than 20%. But her luck was about to change.\nThe Conservatives\' electoral fortunes may have hit a nadir in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power in a Labour landslide, but there was a silver lining for the party and for the aspiring politician when she won the seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire, having beaten her future chancellor Philip Hammond to be selected as the candidate. It\'s a seat she has held ever since.\nAn early advocate of Conservative ""modernisation"" in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999, under William Hague, as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party\'s first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith.\nShe launched a drive to get more women selected as Conservative candidates in winnable seats but antagonised the party\'s grass roots by telling them in a conference speech that they were still seen by some as ""the nasty party"" and had to change their ways.\nSome activists struggled to forgive her for that but it was an early sign of her willingness to deliver unpalatable home truths.\nAs home secretary, she was booed offstage by angry officers at the Police Federation annual conference, after she had told them they should welcome her reforms and ""stop pretending"" they were being ""picked on"" by the government.\nAfter Iain Duncan Smith\'s brief, chaotic reign as Tory leader, Mrs May held a range of senior posts under his successor Michael Howard.\nBut she was conspicuously not part of the ""Notting Hill set"" which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne\'s path to power.\nShe was initially appointed shadow leader of the House of Commons, but gradually raised her standing and by 2009 had become shadow work and pensions secretary.\nNevertheless, her promotion to the job of home secretary when the Conservatives joined with the Lib Dems to form the first coalition government in 70 years was still something of a surprise - given that Chris Grayling had been shadowing the brief in opposition.\nThe Home Office had proved to be the kiss of death for many a promising political career, but Mrs May refused to let this happen to her.\nShe became the longest-serving occupant of the office in recent history, staying in the post for six years, and developing a reputation as a tough operator who would always fight her corner.\nDespite her liberal instincts in some policy areas, such as stop and search powers for the police, she frequently clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, particularly over her plan to increase internet surveillance to combat terrorism, dubbed the ""snooper\'s charter"" by the Lib Dems.\nAfter one ""difficult"" meeting with Mr Clegg, he reportedly told Lib Dem minister David Laws: ""You know, I\'ve grown to rather like Theresa May... She\'s a bit of an ice maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Cameron once said, \'She\'s exactly like that with me too!\'""\nCrime levels fell and she successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she listed as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.\nThere was a bitter public row with cabinet colleague Michael Gove in June 2014 over the best way to combat Islamist extremism, which ended with Mr Gove having to apologise to the prime minister and Mrs May having to sack a long-serving special adviser.\nMrs May faced constant criticism over the government\'s failure to meet its promise to get net migration down to below 100,000 a year, She persisted with this target when she entered Downing Street, even though she had never come close to meeting it and had faced repeated calls from Tory colleagues to drop it.\nHer decision to make life more difficult for illegal immigrants by restricting access to the NHS and accommodation - and vowing to ""deport first and hear appeals later"" - would also come back to haunt her when she became prime minister.\nThe Windrush scandal - which saw Commonwealth citizens who had lived in the UK legally for decades being harassed and even deported because they did not have the correct paperwork - led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd, although the minister would later return to the cabinet after an inquiry blamed officials for the Windrush fiasco.\nShe became Conservative leader and prime minister in July 2016 without a general election, following the resignation of David Cameron.\nLike Mr Cameron, she had been against Brexit but she cleverly managed to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side during the referendum campaign by keeping a low profile.\nShe reaped her reward by emerging as the unchallenged successor to Mr Cameron, as other potential rivals fell by the wayside - portraying herself as a steady pair of hands who would deliver the will of the people and take Britain out of the EU in as orderly a fashion as possible.\nAt 59, she was the oldest leader to enter Downing Street since James Callaghan in 1976 and was the first prime minister since Ted Heath not to have children.\nMrs May has rarely opened up about her private life although she revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and would require insulin injections twice a day for the rest of her life - something she said she had come to terms with and which would not affect her career.\nShortly before becoming prime minister, in July 2016, she spoke to the Mail on Sunday about the impact that being told they could not have children had had on the couple\'s marriage.\nOne of her first acts, on entering Downing Street, was to sack Chancellor George Osborne, which seemed to signal a clean break with the past. He would go on to get his revenge in his new, post-politics job as Evening Standard editor with a string of hostile front pages.\nTo the surprise of many, she also rescued Boris Johnson\'s career by appointing him foreign secretary, a decision she may have come to regret when he quit the cabinet two years later in protest at her Brexit plans.\nShe announced that her government would focus on the more neglected parts of Britain and try to help people on modest incomes who were ""just about managing"" - seen by some as a grab for traditional Labour territory.\nShe had always insisted it was not in the national interest to seek a mandate of her own in a general election.\nWestminster was stunned, then, when on a quiet Tuesday morning in April a lectern was set up in Downing Street for a prime ministerial announcement.\nShe would be holding a snap election after all, because, she said, the country needed certainty, stability and ""strong leadership"" following the EU referendum.\nHer change of heart had, apparently, come on a walking holiday in Wales, with husband Philip.\nWith a commanding 20-point lead over Labour in the opinion polls, she saw an opportunity to ""strengthen her hand"" in the upcoming Brexit negotiations with Brussels.\nDespite her evident discomfort with personality politics, she was placed front and centre as the campaign headed out across the country.\nThere was an early mis-step as she was forced to do a U-turn on one of her key manifesto pledges - social care charges for the elderly in England.\nShe had to cap the amount of money one individual could be asked to pay, following claims people would have to sell their homes. At a testy press conference she insisted ""nothing had changed"".\nThe Conservatives had underestimated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who came across on television as a more genial figure than the dangerous extremist that he had been painted by Tory MPs and their supporters in the press.\nMrs May refused to take part in televised debates with him, and her attempts to project a more human side in interviews sometimes fell flat. She was mercilessly mocked on social media when she told an ITV interviewer the naughtiest thing she had done as a child was to ""run through fields of wheat"".\nNevertheless, no-one seriously expected her to lose the election.\nThe shock at Tory HQ, when the exit poll was announced, pointing towards a hung Parliament, with the Conservatives as the largest party but without an overall majority, rapidly turned to disbelief. But it turned out to be broadly accurate, unlike the opinion polls in the run up to election day.\nMrs May had won the biggest share of the vote for the Conservative Party since Margaret Thatcher\'s 1983 post-Falklands election victory.\nBut Labour had seen the biggest percentage increase in their vote since 1945, drawing in millions of anti-Tory voters from smaller parties, in a surprise return to two-party politics.\nSo instead of returning to Downing Street in triumph, Mrs May was forced to strike a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs agreed to support her in key Commons votes, sweetened by a 1bn public spending boost for Northern Ireland.\nThe DUP was staunchly Brexit-supporting and it would go on to play a pivotal role in the Brexit dramas she would face as she tried to get her withdrawal deal through Parliament.\nMrs May had backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, although she was barely visible during the campaign. Downing Street aides had reportedly nicknamed her ""submarine May"" for her alleged habit of going missing when Mr Cameron wanted her public backing for the Remain campaign.\nNevertheless, many Leave-voting Tory MPs suspected she did not believe in Brexit, and viewed it as a ""damage-limitation"" exercise at best.\nShe did her best to dispel these doubts with her constant mantra ""Brexit means Brexit"" and her vow to deliver on the ""will"" of the people as expressed in the referendum.\nTo the delight of Brexiteer colleagues, and the dismay of pro-Europeans, she set out a harder-than-expected vision for Brexit in a speech at Lancaster House in January 2017.\nThree months later she triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting the formal two-year process to take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc.\nShe stressed that Britain would be leaving the EU single market and customs union - and repeatedly declared that Britain would be prepared to walk away from talks with the EU without a deal.\n""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" joined her list of favourite Brexit phrases, repeated ad infinitum.\nBut negotiations in Brussels, led by Brexit Secretary David Davis, ran into the sand over the issue of how to prevent the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland.\nHopes of striking a trade deal by Brexit day had also evaporated and there was now talk of a 21-month transition period, to allow more time for negotiations.\nThings came to a head in July 2018 when the Cabinet met at her country retreat, Chequers, to hammer out a joint position on Brexit that would see the UK establish a ""common rulebook"" with the EU after Brexit.\nWithin a few days of Mrs May announcing that she had full cabinet backing, Boris Johnson and David Davis had both quit saying this was not the Brexit they had been promised in her Lancaster House speech.\nShe also had to endure the humiliation of seeing her Chequers deal publicly rejected - and mocked - by EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg, Austria.\nThere was a brief respite from the grim Brexit grind in the autumn, when she shimmied on stage at the Conservative Party conference to the strains of Abba\'s Dancing Queen.\nIt helped to dispel the memory of the previous year\'s conference speech, which had been one of the most disastrous on record, with letters falling off the slogan behind her, an interruption from a comedian and a hacking cough that threatened to derail it altogether.\nBy now, Brexit had largely pushed all her other domestic priorities to one side, although the prime minister did agree a 20bn long-term funding settlement for the NHS.\nIn November 2018, she unveiled a draft EU withdrawal agreement, announcing, after a marathon cabinet meeting, that she had the backing of her top team, only to be faced with a string of resignations hours later.\nThe withdrawal agreement, with an accompanying statement on future relations, was the best and only deal available, she said.\nAnd it would take the UK out of the EU in an ""orderly fashion"", with the minimum of disruption for businesses and citizens of EU countries in the EU as well as British expats in EU countries.\nBut one clause, known as the Irish ""backstop"", was proving too much for the increasingly vocal and angry Brexiteer wing of her party, who feared the Remain-voting prime minister was betraying the 17.4 million who had voted to leave the EU.\nThe backstop was meant to prevent the return of a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland if no trade deal had been agreed by the end of the transition period but there was no time-limit on it and no way for the UK to halt it without the EU\'s say-so.\nOpposition to the backstop was led by the DUP and a previously obscure group of Tory backbenchers, the European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nMrs May had to get her deal through Parliament but her plans for a vote on 10 December were pulled at the last minute, when it became clear she would have suffered a heavy defeat.\nTwo days later, she faced an attempt to remove her as Conservative leader, and prime minister, in a no-confidence vote orchestrated by the ERG.\nShe survived by 200 votes to 117.\nBut it was just the beginning of a seemingly never-ending cycle of political torture she would go on to suffer at the hands of her mutinous MPs.\nWhen she did eventually put her deal to a vote in the Commons, it was rejected by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a government in parliamentary history.\nThe one thing that united them was dislike of Theresa May\'s deal.\nWhen she returned to the Commons with a slightly tweaked version of it, MPs rejected it again, by a reduced but still hefty margin of 149.\nPower was now visibly ebbing away from her, as her divided cabinet openly discussed alternatives to her deal and junior ministers resigned with such regularity that they barely made the news.\nParliament was also flexing its muscles - MPs voted to reject a no-deal Brexit, something Mrs May had always insisted must stay on the table in negotiations with Brussels.\nShe had to hold a Commons vote on delaying Brexit, something she had repeatedly insisted she would never do.\nAnd she had to rely on the votes of Labour MPs to get it through, after most of the Conservative contingent defied the whip.\nShe then had to go to Brussels to ask for a delay to Brexit - another thing she had said she would never do - as MPs rejected her deal for a third time.\nBritain\'s departure date from the EU was written into UK law as 29 March - and Mrs May had insisted, more than 100 times according to some, that it would not change.\nShe laid the blame for the delay squarely at the door of MPs, in a late evening speech from Downing Street, in which she tried to position herself as being on the side of the public who, she said, were ""tired of infighting and political games"" over Brexit.\nIt proved to be another misjudgement, antagonising many of the MPs she was trying to persuade to back her deal and leading to accusations she was behaving like a demagogue.\nShe had to climb down the following day, offering something close to an apology, as she announced the new timetable for Brexit that had been imposed on her by Brussels.\nIn an attempt to negotiate a Brexit compromise that could pass muster in the Commons, she also reached out to Jeremy Corbyn.\nBut six weeks of talks with Labour ended without an agreement, an outcome many Tory MPs said was depressingly predictable.\nA further humiliation followed when she had to agree to the UK participating in European Parliament elections - something she had previously said would be unacceptable.\nThe Conservatives barely mounted a campaign to speak of, in contrast to Nigel Farage\'s boisterous new Brexit Party.\nWith the party\'s European poll ratings dropping into single figures and would-be successors openly touting their leadership credentials, she made one final attempt to get MPs on side.\nShe promised them they would get a binding vote on whether to hold another referendum during the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and would also get to decide on different options for the UK\'s future customs arrangements with the EU.\nBrexit could be lost if her deal was rejected, she added.\nBut by now many MPs had given up listening, having reached the conclusion that she was an impediment to the kind of Brexit they craved - or any kind of Brexit.\nWell and truly cornered, Mrs May finally had to accept she could not continue ""in the job she loved"" and her time in Downing Street - barring a brief transition period - was now over.\n""I have done my best,"" she said, as she announced the resignation from behind a podium outside Number 10.', 'description': ""How Brexit led to the downfall of the UK's second female prime minister."", 'source_domain': 'www.bbc.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-PER', 'word': 'Theresa'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': 'May'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Britain'}, {'entity': 'B-ORG', 'word': 'European'}, {'entity': 'I-ORG', 'word': 'Union'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': '10'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Down'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##ing'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Street'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'London'}, {'entity': 'B-MISC', 'word': 'B'}, {'entity': 'I-MISC', 'word': '##re'}, {'entity': 'I-MISC', 'word': '##xi'}, {'entity': 'I-MISC', 'word': '##t'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.bbc.com'], 'dates': ['2019-05-24T09:36:01'], 'languages': ['']}",1

Half a century after their emergence in Paris, these covered arcades flourished in Istanbul, drawing on French, Italian, and Ottoman architectural styles. Straddling the boundary between seedy and stunning, the citys arcades offer a meze of experience to the modern-day flneur, in contrast to souks where whole sections are devoted to one product, say leather, gold or precious stones. However, the recent take over of Anadolu Pasaj by a chain store highlights the vulnerability of these treasure troves to urban change. Go soon to see them while they still stand.\niek Pasaj\nGreek banker Hristaki Zografos Efendi built this most famous of Beyolu arcades on the site of the Naum Theatre, which was destroyed by fire in 1870. The original name, Cit de Pera, is still visible between the ornate caryatids and clock face above the entrance. The word iek, Turkish for flower, derives from the bouquets once sold there by White Russian exiles. Since its renovation in 1988, the grand interior has been lined with meyhanes (traditional bar/restaurants offering the quintessential trio of meze, fish, and rak. Ceneviz Meyhanesi is recommended for a night of aniseed-flavoured abandon.\nstiklal Caddesi No 80\nHazzopulo Pasaj\nIn contrast to a typical Parisian passage, this arcade is covered with hanging vines and tree branches rather than glass. Its cobbled floor runs from stiklal Caddesi to Merutiyet Caddesi, in the Beyolu district, and its central courtyard holds a hubbub of tea, waterpipes and backgammon. The arcades name comes from the Greek Hacopulo banking family, who opened the arcade in 1871, and it was later frequented by Ottoman writer Ahmet Mithat Efendi and the Young Turks. When youve finished browsing the bargain jewellery, secondhand books and Istanbul-themed T-shirts, sit down for an authentic and reasonably priced taste of diyarbakr (liver kebab) at Yirmibir Kebap.\nstiklal Caddesi No 116\nAslhan Pasaj\nIf your senses tingle at the scent of vintage pages, then this arcade will be a labyrinth of delight. Also known as Sahaflar arss (secondhand bookshops bazaar), Aslhan Pasaj offers two floors of used books, magazines, comics, and posters. Dozens of shops on each floor contain an inexhaustible library, covering everything from Anatolian mythology to pulp fiction and contemporary art. Gezegen Sahaf, on the top floor, is the largest of these shops, with an emphasis on art history and antique books.\nMerutiyet Caddesi No 10\nAtlas Pasaj\nJust like modern malls, many of these arcades were designed to offer entertainment as well as shopping. Atlas Pasaj has been a home to Atlas Cinema and the Kk Sahne state theatre since 1948  find these next to Sefahathane cafe and bar, whose arcade tables are a cosier alternative to true outdoor drinking. Just like iek Pasaj, this arcades original building was destroyed in the fire of 1870, after which the ground floor became a stable for horse dealers. Past the bar and cinema you will find a jumble of shops for womens fashion, antiques, and novelty souvenirs.\nstiklal Caddesi No 131\nFransz Geidi\nStanding by the Karaky shore, Fransz Geidi reflects the strong presence of European traders at this port throughout the Ottoman era. Built in 1860, the cross-shaped arcade had fallen into disrepair before being restored to its neoclassical glory in 1992. The lower floors are filled with upscale cafes and restaurants, including Ops Passage, owned by former sea captain Yasin Kalender. The Turkish breakfast, fresh seafood and kadayf dessert (similar to baklava) are not to be passed by. Meanwhile, Kathanes reproductions of vintage Turkish school notebooks make excellent gifts.\nMumhane Caddesi, opposite the Turkish Orthodox Church; second entrance on Kemanke Caddesi\nAvrupa Pasaj\nAround the corner from stiklal Caddesi, one of Istanbuls famous avenues, the entrance to this glass-covered arcade is easily missed. But its worth finding Avrupa Pasaj for its architecture alone, and also the engrossing displays of antiques, textiles, ceramics, and lamps. The arcade was previously called Aynal Pasaj (mirrored arcade) after the ground floors 22 mirrors  which also fell victim to the great fire of 1870. A row of classical figures still adorns the arcades sculpted walls, which stretch upwards to an arched glass ceiling. If you feel your life would be more complete with a meerschaum pipe or an Ottoman dagger, then Avrupa Pasaj is the place for you.\nMerutiyet Caddesi No 8\nSuriye pasaj\nThis neoclassical pasaj was commissioned by a relative of the Syrian Hasan Halbuni Paa, the first Muslim to head the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. Impressive wrought iron doors flank the entrance, leading to an ornate arcade crossed by four bridges. A traditional teashop spreads its tables here while the Coop live music bar attracts an alternative crowd at the arcades far end. Vintage-lovers should dive into By Retro, an underground maze of eccentric fashion that has provided costumes for Turkish films and television shows\nstiklal Caddesi No 166\nTokatlyan Pasaj\nUnder the ownership of the Armenian Mgrdi Tokatlyan, the Hotel M Tokatlyan was a fixture in the high-class social life of Pera, the historic Istanbul quarter now known as Beyolu. Notable patrons included Leon Trotsky and Mustafa Kemal, but by the 1950s the building had changed hands and fallen into disrepair, at which point a local Armenian church bought the property. Calls to preserve the hotel as a museum were ignored, and small shops soon filled the space. A visit to Tokatlyan Pasaj is an eerie exercise in memory  catch melancholy glimpses of Peras fantastic past as you stroll by the barbers, teashops, and printing presses.\nstiklal Caddesi No 76\nAkmar Pasaj\nFound in the Asian neighbourhood of Kadky, Akmar Pasaj entered popular parlance as the satanist arcade after 21-year-old ehriban Cokunfrat was ritually killed by three friends in 1999 and a police raid on the arcade discovered Satanist literature, axes and crosses, and 15 people were remanded in custody. Shops selling heavy metal LPs, CDs, tapes and T-shirts still line the arcade today, though you will also find more innocent purveyors of precious stones, crystals and secondhand books  the most reputable of these is Nadir Kitabevi.\nMhrdar Caddesi No 70\nAznavur Pasaj\nThis arcade began life in 1900 as a block of luxury apartments with a private courtyard, before being opened at both ends to allow pedestrians in. Eminent Armenian architect Hovsep Aznavur put his name to the building, also designing the striking Msr Apartman on stiklal Caddesi and several of Istanbuls theatres, hans and churches. Today, Aznavur Pasaj is a prime spot to spend an hour or two surrounded by colourful tights, outlandish underwear, vampy boots and headgear of all kinds. The arcades variety of inexpensive jewellery and evil-eye baubles is also a sight to behold.\nstiklal Caddesi No 108', 'description': 'Architecture and shopping go hand in hand at these characterful arcades, which also offer a glimpse into the citys rich past', 'source_domain': 'www.theguardian.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Istanbul'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.theguardian.com'], 'dates': ['2015-11-10T00:00:00'], 'languages': ['']}",1

""When they got down they heard a noise in the bushes, and the tiger was jumping out of the bushes on him (Paul Dhaliwal),"" the affidavit revealed.\nPolice later found a partial shoe print that matched Dhaliwal\'s on top of the railing, Matthews said in the documents.\nThe Siberian tiger attacked the three men on Christmas Day last year after leaping over a 1m (3ft) wall and out of its enclosure.

All three had marijuana in their systems.\nKulbir Dhaliwal told police that the three had smoked pot and each had ""a couple shots of vodka"" before leaving San Jose for the zoo on Christmas Day, the affidavit said. Police found a small amount of marijuana in Kulbir\'s car, which the victims had driven to the zoo, as well as a partially drunk bottle of vodka, according to court documents.\nZoo spokesman Sam Singer said he had not seen the documents but believed the victims did taunt the animal, even though they claim they had not.

Im here to photograph an informal meeting about the benefits of voting for independence in the upcoming referendum on whether Scotland should break its union with the rest of the United Kingdom.\nBut if attendance at this gathering is anything to go by, the vote in favour of secession may be in serious trouble.\nAccording to some observers, Kilmarnock, a down-on-its-luck manufacturing town in the west of Scotland, should be a pro-independence heartland. The economically depressed, so the theory goes, are more likely to vote for change.\nYet, here in the Fenwick hotel, 15 minutes past the time the meeting should have started, barely anyone is here. Its so empty I can hear the tick of a wristwatch from three rows away. We all stare awkwardly at the rain sliding down the windows and wait.\nThen  bang.\nThe door flies open and two chattering volunteers breeze in. They bustle to the front of the room and begin stacking Yes to independence campaign leaflets and draping a Scottish Saltire flag over a desk. They are oblivious to the settled gloom until one of them turns around and notices something is missing.\nShe raises an eyebrow but, without missing a beat, says: Ah, the others must be in the bar! Ill go fetch them.\nSure enough, a few minutes later, dozens of jovial locals file into the conference room. The air of despondency is replaced by one of anticipation. Theres a sense of excitement too, although it is unclear whether this is caused by the election that lies ahead, or by a round of drinks.\nWhat is clear is that in Kilmarnock the campaign for an independent Scotland is underway and the people here are  despite their late arrival  engaged in the process.\nThis seems to be the case elsewhere in the town too. Later, I find myself outside the Kay Park Tavern. From outside, this neighbourhood pub is deceptively large, a long, low building resembling a grand old coaching inn. Inside, its cramped and dimly lit.\nIts a pub for locals. Walking in, I might as well be an out-of-town gunslinger barging through the swing doors of a Western saloon. Conversation halts. Drinks slam onto tables. Everyone swivels to stare at the newcomer. If anyone had been playing at the dartboard over in the corner, Im sure the dart wouldve frozen in mid-air.\nWith all eyes on me, I sidle in to speak to the bartender. I ask permission to take photographs, anticipating the scrape of barstools as drinkers rush to eject me.\nThe barman is called Jimmy Lund. He puts on a stern expression after listening to my request and asks: Why on earth would you want to photograph this lot?\nTo my relief he quickly adds: Aye, of course you can!\nI am immediately ushered around to his side of the beer pumps to face a panel of bar room political experts  all with differing opinions about Septembers referendum.\nLund puts his opinion succinctly: I dont want to be part of the Union Jack!\nCustomer William Francis, sipping his pint of cider, agrees: We could survive without England!\nAnother, Isabel Creighton, sides with the Better Together campaign (as the No voters call it). There arent enough guarantees, she says.\nThe crux of the debate in the Kay Park Tavern and elsewhere, is that the vote represents a choice between the familiar and the unknown.\nThe risks are heightened because there is only one vote. Its not a political term of office that will simply be voted against in four or five years if it doesnt work out. And it isn\'t hinged to a particular candidate.\nDenise Campbell, out for a stroll with her husband and 16-week-old daughter, worries that some people are confusing the referendum with Alex Salmond, the leader of the Scottish National Party, which has championed the cause of independence.\nSome people don\'t particularly like Alex Salmond and the SNP, she says. They think they are voting for them. But theyre not voting for them, they are they are voting for an Independent Scotland.\nA few weeks later Im in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh - a wealthy city that should, in theory at least, be the anti-independence flip side to Kilmarnock.\nAt the 150-year old Cafe Royals Circle Bar, a stylish Victorian pub adorned with ornate ceramic murals depicting famous Scottish inventors, men in sharp suits swarm the bar and buzzing conversations bounce off the high baroque ceilings.\nI could easily be tourist in this part of town. So could a few others in the bar, and there are no slammed pint glasses when I enter.\nI strike up a conversation with retired widower Archibald Anderson, a refined-looking Scot.\nAnderson is happy to talk politics and reminisces about serving in the British military alongside soldiers from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Between sips of his pint of Tennents he says: I can\'t imagine why we would want to be separate.\nThis was a typical response when I pressed other voters who sided with the Better Together campaign. Change is risky.\nBut trying to predict the outcome of the referendum is no easy task. Opinion polls have offered varied forecasts and simply trying to guess the voting outcome by dividing Scotland into zones of prosperity and decline doesnt work either.\nA case in point is Stuart Knapp, a 39-year-old electrical engineer whom I met back in Kilmarnock.\nKnapp plans to vote No to Independence and eagerly discussed the gravity of the vote while walking his dog in the towns Dean Castle Country Park.\nLets say we vote for independence and 10 years down the line it hasn\'t worked and we want to change back, he said. We wont be allowed to were going to be stuck in our independent Scotland.', 'description': 'A group of students gather on their bikes in Kilmarnock, a dilapidated town in western Scotland, where pawnbrokers and discount stores dominate the local shopping centre.', 'source_domain': 'widerimage.reuters.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Ba'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##oral'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Clock'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Edinburgh'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'UK'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['widerimage.reuters.com'], 'dates': [None], 'languages': ['']}",1
"Despite many kingpins like Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman being put in jail, many say Mexico's war on drugs has been futile",1,0,9,7.56476092338562,"[{'title': ""El Chapo: How Mexico's drug kingpin fell victim to his own legend"", 'date': '2016-01-09T10:11:15', 'content': 'Caked in filth, the world\'s most powerful drug baron hauled himself from a manhole.\nFor Joaqun ""El Chapo"" Guzmn, whose feats of escapology were matched only by his drug-smuggling acumen, it was a trademark yet ultimately futile manoeuvre. The 17 Mexican marines raiding his ranch nearby would catch him soon enough.\nSix months earlier, he had humiliated Mexican authorities by fleeing Mexico\'s most secure prison, his second jailbreak in two decades. This time he would not slip through their fingers, although those who caught him were left in no doubt how angry he was to have been arrested.\n""You are all going to die,"" he warned police in the hours after his capture in Los Mochis, north-west Mexico, on 8 January 2016.\nThree years on, Guzmn has been handed a life sentence, plus 30 years, after being found guilty of international drug smuggling in a lurid three-month trial that exposed his criminal empire.\nAt his sentencing in New York, Guzmn said he had received an unfair trial and his treatment in solitary confinement was tantamount to torture.\n""We\'re never going to see his like again,"" Douglas Century, the author of the book Hunting El Chapo, told the BBC.\nGuzmn was the oldest of seven children born into a poor family in the rural community of La Tuna in Sinaloa state, north-west Mexico.\nHis parents - Emilio Guzmn Bustillos and Mara Consuelo Loera Prez - earned their living from farming. His father was officially a cattle rancher but is believed to have been an opium poppy farmer, Malcolm Beith writes in his book, The Last Narco.\nGuzmn\'s enterprising spirit was apparent from a young age. He would support his family by selling oranges to peasant farmers for a few pesos. His penchant for the spoils of wealth didn\'t go unnoticed, either. In a Vice News podcast, Guzmn\'s younger sister Bernarda said he would wear fake gold jewellery when visiting family members.\n""Even as a little child, he had ambitions,"" his mother told filmmakers in 2014. She recalled he had ""a lot of paper money"" which he would count and recount.\nHis first foray into organised crime came at the age of 15, when he cultivated his own marijuana plantation with his cousins. Then, he adopted the nickname ""El Chapo"" - Mexican slang for ""Shorty"". But his ambitions belied his diminutive stature (he is only 5ft 6ins, or 1.64m).\nIn his late teens, Guzmn left La Tuna to seek his fortune in drug smuggling. ""He always fought for a better life,"" his mother said.\nGuzmn\'s reputation for ruthless efficiency was duly noted. In the 1980s he was introduced to Miguel ngel Flix Gallardo - known as the Godfather of the Guadalajara cartel - who put him in charge of handling logistics.\nWhen Flix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, his cartel\'s drug trafficking territories were divided among different factions, later known as The Federation. Guzmn was a beneficiary, setting up his own Sinaloa cartel with other traffickers in north-west Mexico.\nIn the 1990s, he honed his operation, pioneering the use of sophisticated underground tunnels to move drugs across the border.\n""He was the go-to guy,"" David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, told the BBC. ""When the United States started shutting down ports of entry in the Atlantic and Pacific in the 1990s, drugs had to go through Mexico. And if it had to go through Mexico, it had to go through El Chapo.""\nHe invested his proceeds wisely, not only expanding his enterprise, but building infrastructure that benefited locals in Sinaloa too. This cemented his popularity. ""You are Santa Claus. And everybody likes Santa Claus,"" Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico\'s former ambassador in Washington, told the New Yorker in 2014.\nOver time, Guzmn\'s cartel became one of the biggest traffickers of drugs to the US and in 2009, he entered Forbes\' list of the world\'s richest men at number 701, with an estimated worth of $1bn (709m).\nAs his wealth and empire grew, so too did scrutiny from law enforcement. ""The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been after him for decades,"" Mr Weinstein said.\nIn 1993, a Roman Catholic cardinal was shot dead in a turf war with rival drug smugglers. Guzmn was among those blamed and a bounty was placed on his head by the Mexican government. His moustachioed face, previously unknown to the public, started appearing in newspapers and on TV screens. Within weeks, he was arrested in Guatemala and he was later sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, drug trafficking and bribery.\nA prison psychological profile described him as ""egocentric, narcissistic, shrewd, persistent, tenacious, meticulous, discriminating, and secretive"", according to the New Yorker. In prison, he enjoyed a life of luxury, smuggling in lovers, prostitutes and Viagra, according to reports in Mexico.\nEight years behind bars was enough for Guzmn. In January 2001, he broke out of a top-security jail, Puente Grande. He did so, as the myth goes, in a laundry cart. What\'s more likely, multiple journalists and authors argue, is that he simply walked out of the door with the help of corrupt guards.\nGuzmn controlled the prison to such an extent he escaped in police uniform, Mexican journalist Anabel Hernndez wrote in her book, Narcoland. Guzmn would spend the next decade evading authorities and consolidating his power as Mexico\'s pre-eminent drug smuggler. In that period, he always seemed to be one step ahead of would-be captors and rival cartels.\n""He\'s a micro-manager,"" said Mr Century, who co-authored his book with Andrew Hogan, the undercover DEA agent who caught Guzmn in 2014. ""In the text messages we have, he\'s in the weeds of every single minor facet of his drug operation.""\nSex was his other preoccupation, Mr Century said. ""He had more mistresses than you can probably fathom. This was his existence: having sex with strange women and micro-managing every detail of his operation.""\nAfter 13 years on the run, Guzmn was captured by Mexican marines called in by Mr Hogan in February 2014. Guzmn\'s second prison break, in July 2015, was arguably even more fantastical than the first. This time, his accomplices used GPS to burrow a 1.5km (one mile) tunnel that led directly underneath his cell in Altiplano prison in central Mexico.\nThe escape was elaborate and carefully planned. The tunnel had ventilation, lighting and stairs and the exit was hidden by a construction site. Mexican TV stations later aired footage that showed that guards failed to act when loud hammering was heard from inside Guzmn\'s cell.\nGuzmn had embarrassed Mexico\'s government for the second time, leaving then-President Enrique Pea Nieto ""deeply troubled"" and ""outraged"".\nHis freedom, however, was short-lived. In January 2016, Guzmn was tracked down to a house in an affluent part of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Five of Guzmn\'s guards were killed in the raid by Mexican marines and he managed to flee out of a manhole, but was caught in a car while leaving town. One year later, he was extradited to the US.\nHis Achilles\' heel, Mr Century told the BBC, was his narcissism. He was reaching out to actors and directors to commission screenplays about his life, Mr Century said. His communication with actors and producers gifted Mexico\'s attorney general a new line of investigation.\n""When he escaped from prison in 2015, he probably could have run away to the mountains and just lived,"" Mr Century said. Instead, Guzmn made the unprecedented move of granting an exclusive interview to Hollywood actor Sean Penn in October 2015. It was a decision that may have cost him his freedom.\n""I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats,"" he said in the interview published in Rolling Stone magazine. After his capture it was speculated - though never formally confirmed - that Mexican authorities found Guzmn by tracking Penn. ""He contacted actresses and producers, which was part of one line of investigation,"" said Mexico\'s attorney general, Arely Gmez.\nHis beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, she said, ""looked bored most of the time"" - even when Guzmn\'s former mistress testified. While Coronel remained placid, the trial\'s astonishing moments shocked others.\nOne witness, for example, told the court Guzmn buried a man alive. Another told of a rival narco chief who refused to shake Guzmn\'s hand - and paid for it with his life. Court papers also accused him of drugging and raping girls as young as 13, calling them his ""vitamins"".\nThe scale of his drug trafficking operation was laid bare, too.\nAssistant US Attorney Adam Fels alleged that Guzmn had sent the equivalent of more than a line of cocaine for every single person in the US in just four shipments. And to protect his businesses, a bribe of $100m (77m) was paid to former President Pea Nieto when he took office in 2012, it was alleged in court. Mr Pea Nieto strenuously denies the allegation.\nWhen Guzmn\'s guilty verdict was read aloud, his mouth was ""agape"" and he looked ""vaguely stunned"", the New York Times reported.\nIn a trial that attracted podcasters, screenwriters and true-crime obsessives, some observers said the media attention trivialised the proceedings. The intention was quite the contrary, our correspondent said. The trial was meant to be a public spectacle to show what El Chapo and his henchmen had done and to send a warning to others, she said.\nThe title of Mr Beith\'s book, The Last Narco, suggests Guzmn is one of a dying breed of ultra-violent drug barons as bloodthirsty as they are shrewd.\nYet, while Guzmn is likely to die behind bars, Mexico\'s drug-smuggling problem is likely to outlive him. In his Rolling Stone interview, Guzmn said it was false to assume drug trafficking would cease ""the day I don\'t exist"".\nFor all his supposed vanity and self-confidence, not even Guzmn can claim to be the last narco.', 'description': 'The worlds most powerful drug kingpin was enamoured by his own legend and it cost him his freedom.', 'source_domain': 'www.bbc.com'}, {'title': 'El Chapo: what the rise and fall of the kingpin reveals about the war on drugs', 'date': '2019-06-07T05:00:15', 'content': 'Just after midday on Tuesday 12 February, word came down that the verdict was ready in what had been widely described as the trial of the century. United States of America v Joaqun Guzmn Loera had lasted approximately three months  it took prosecutors that long to present what they described as an avalanche of evidence, which had taken more than a decade to compile. The government called 56 witnesses, the defence called only one: an FBI agent, who finished testifying within an hour.\nThere was little expectation that Guzmn would mount a convincing defence. The diminutive 61-year-old (his nickname, El Chapo, means shorty in Spanish) was known around the world as a leader of Mexicos Sinaloa cartel, and the most high-profile drug kingpin since Pablo Escobar. In addition to smuggling thousands of tonnes of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and synthetic narcotics across the US-Mexico border, he had successfully pulled off two dramatic escapes from prisons in Mexico. He has been the subject of dozens of books, two popular TV series and, in 2009, was included in Forbes magazines list of billionaires. The following year, that same magazine named Guzmn one of the worlds most-wanted fugitives, second to only Osama bin Laden. As Guzmns lawyers liked to tell anybody who would listen, even before their client set foot in Brooklyn, he had already been convicted in the court of public opinion.\nWhen he was captured by Mexican marines on 8 January 2016, Guzmn became the prize feather in the cap of the countrys law enforcement. Barack Obama called Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto to congratulate him on the arrest, and in a move that could be interpreted either as a parting gift to Obama or a peace offering to his successor, Guzmn was extradited to New York on 19 January 2017, a day before Trump took office. Jack Riley, a retired Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) chief who recently published a book about his role in Guzmns arrest, told me that in the view of US authorities, catching El Chapo was an important warning to criminals around the world. Regardless of where you are, if you are breaking American laws, eventually, were going to get you.\nAmericans spend around $109bn on illegal drugs each year, and Bloomberg estimates that the Sinaloa cartel makes at least $11bn in annual sales to the US. But while Mexican cartels regularly appear in the US media, most people are unfamiliar with the circumstances that contributed to their rise. It is not common knowledge that Mexico launched its own war on drugs in the mid-2000s, or that the biggest cartels are sophisticated operations worth billions of dollars. Nor are many people aware that cartels are increasingly responsible for fentanyl, a form of synthetic heroin, entering the US. In an address to the media after the verdict was handed down, US government officials emphasised this point and the role of illegal fentanyl in perpetuating the opioids crisis.\nWhile the workings of his business may be a mystery, Americans have heard of El Chapo. By the time he appeared in court in 2018, he was a late-night TV punchline, a symbol of extreme wealth and an escape artist with a talent for leaving law enforcement with their hands empty.\nAt the trial, Guzmn was found guilty of all charges against him, including the most serious  having engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise. He will be sentenced at the end of June, and is almost certain to be jailed for life. His lawyers are seeking a retrial on the basis of jury misconduct, but the chances of that happening are slim.\nWhen I was in Mexico City this spring, a month after the verdict, talk of the trial had already died down. Guzmns image had mostly disappeared from the magazine covers on display at the news kiosks that dot the streets of the capital. While people could still name the Sinaloa cartels leaders and lieutenants, they were more interested in the newer cartels, such as Jalisco Nueva Generacin or the local La Unin. Many people didnt want to discuss El Chapo at all. Narco fatigue  the exhaustion that comes with being oversaturated by news and pop culture about the drug trade  had long ago set in. Over the past 13 years, Mexicos internal war on drugs has dominated the media, resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and failed to stop narcotrafficking.\nGuzmns arrest did not magically rid Mexico, or the US, of violence or drugs. Above all, his trial demonstrated how disposable any single person is in the larger machinations of the narco-state. There has never been a clear definition of what exactly constitutes a cartel, and as smaller, more transient gangs replace larger organisations, going after leaders like Guzmn seems increasingly pointless. Rather than reducing the levels of violence and trafficking in Mexico, that approach  the so-called kingpin strategy, employed by Mexico and the US  has enabled new forms of crime to flourish. As Ismael El Mayo Zambada, Chapos longtime partner, said in 2010 in a rare interview with the Mexican news magazine El Proceso, the problem of narcos isnt going away: As soon as capos are locked up, killed or extradited, their replacements are already around.\nSince the early 1990s, the US has targeted cartels via their leaders. It is a fairly straightforward idea: take out the head of an illegal organisation and the rest will collapse. The approach was developed to bring down the Colombian cartels, and in that case, it had some success. When Pablo Escobar was shot to death by Colombian police in 1993, his cartel went down with him.\nBut even as the structures of organised crime have evolved, US law enforcement has generally stuck to this top-down model. If they are not killing drug lords, they are using the American judicial system to make examples of them. Since 2001, when Mexicos supreme court agreed to allow the extradition of criminals so long as they would not face the death penalty or life in prison (this ruling was amended four years later to permit life sentences), dozens of narcotraffickers have been extradited to the US, including members of the Tijuana, Beltrn-Leyva, Sinaloa and Los Zetas cartels. If Guzmn ends up in the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as he is expected to, he will share the facility with former Gulf cartel leader Osiel Crdenas Guilln.\nWhile Sinaloa has historically been, and still remains, Mexicos most powerful cartel, the world it came up in no longer exists. Between the early 90s and the mid-2000s, the Sinaloa, Tijuana, Jurez and Gulf organisations were mini-monopolies, with borders that more or less stayed the same. Then, with the start of Mexicos drug war in 2006, that arrangement started to fall apart. As Mexican and American authorities took out cartel leaders, groups fractured and new ones emerged.\nPreviously, the Zetas, whose leaders came from the special forces of the Mexican army, had been a mercenary group in the employ of the Gulf cartel. Now they became an autonomous organisation. Jalisco Nueva Generacin, which had been linked to Sinaloa, morphed into one of Mexicos most ferocious cartels. Splinter groups and gangs that had originated in prisons or as local militias began to gain power.\nThis fragmentation altered the way cartels do business. To distinguish themselves in a crowded field, the new groups pioneered the use of sadistic, headline-grabbing violence. They also diversified. Whereas an old-school cartel might have once only sold drugs, the upstarts are expanding into different forms of crime. The Zetas are notorious for stealing petrol from nationalised pipelines and selling it on the black market  a business that Sinaloa previously dominated, as journalist Ana Lilia Perz documented in her book El Cartel Negro. The Santa Rosa de Lima cartel also specialises in petrol theft, known nationally as huachicol. Protection rackets are common. And cartels are kidnapping and extorting migrants on their way to the US border. In 2010, the bodies of 72 Central American migrants were found on a ranch in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. According to the lone survivor of the massacre, an 18-year-old Ecuadorian, the Zetas murdered the group when they refused to either pay for their freedom or serve as cartel hitmen.\nAt the same time, older cartels are expanding and decentralising. According to law and economics scholar Edgardo Buscaglia, Sinaloa has a presence in 54 countries and Jalisco Nueva Generacin, one of Mexicos fastest growing cartels, is said to have branched out throughout the Americas. Maintaining such operations requires a vast and diverse network of legal fronts and elaborate systems of money-laundering. To illustrate this point, the journalist Diego Osorno recently noted that the most popular brand of milk in Sinaloa is made by a company owned by Guzmns colleague El Mayo. The Sinaloa cartel operates on such a large scale  connecting manufacturers and distributors, bankers and businesses and extracting money at each step  that there is no longer a single face of the organisation. Buscaglia told me that that if I wanted to see the sophisticated side of the Sinaloa cartel, I should visit a particular gated community in Argentina. I wouldnt find any gangsters flashing guns, he clarified, only the wealthy managers of the cartels legal operations in that country.\nThis fragmentation also means that cartels and low-level gangs are harder to police and prosecute. Paradoxically, there are also more mini-kingpins to capture. And once they are in the US, narcotraffickers can cut plea deals and help prosecutors capture their former bosses and colleagues. Captured Mexican narcos generally have few qualms about cooperating. A good outcome might mean a radically reduced sentence and half their fortune waiting for them on release. An even better outcome might resemble that of Andrs Lpez Lpez, one of the former leaders of Colombias Norte del Valle cartel. In 2006, Lpez had an 11-year sentence knocked down to 20 months after working with authorities. Now based in Miami, he has written three books about trafficking, one of which was adapted into a wildly successful TV show in Latin America. His most recent book, which was also optioned for television, is a biography of El Chapo.\nI first went to the Guzmn trial in early December, and began to go more frequently as a broader picture of cartel operations came into focus. In building the case, prosecutors approached it like a classic mafia roll-up, offering leniency to each captured narco and gradually working their way up the chain until they reached Guzmn. As Miami defence attorney Joaquin Perez, who has represented many extradited narcotraffickers, told me, it was a significant effort for a fait accompli.\nIt also made for good theatre. There were accounts of diamond-encrusted guns and cocaine stash houses in fancy Brooklyn neighbourhoods, million-dollar smuggling submarines capable of evading police radars and elaborate schemes to outwit US law enforcement. Week after week, witnesses described in intricate detail the inner workings of la oficina (the internal nickname for the cartel): its lavish displays of violence and wealth, its complex transportation networks and how Mexican authorities were systematically paid off. In search of material, screenwriters and actors showed up at the trial.\nTabloid headlines advertised the wacky world of the trial, and newspapers ran lists of its most bizarre disclosures. By the time the prosecution rested after 11 weeks of testimony, jurors had heard from Juan Carlos Ramrez Abada, AKA Chupeta (lollipop), a formerly handsome Colombian kingpin who had undergone such extensive plastic surgery to stay in hiding that his face looked like a rubber Halloween mask; Jorge and Alex Cifuentes-Villa, brothers and Colombian career criminals who had worked closely with Guzmn; and Lucero Guadalupe Snchez Lpez, Guzmns mistress and one-time accomplice. Jorge Cifuentes-Villa described attempting to kill a man with a poisoned sandwich, and Alex told the jury that Guzmn had allegedly boasted about bribing former president Pea Nieto for $100m. (Pea Nietos former chief of staff described this claim as false, defamatory and absurd.)\nYet to many of the seasoned narco corresponsales, the trial offered few newsworthy revelations. Everything that was astonishing to American audiences was not to Mexicans, said David Brooks, the US correspondent for the progressive Mexican newspaper La Jornada. Mexican readers were no longer scandalised by accounts of extreme wealth or violence. Besides sex and infidelity, which were of universal interest, Brooks told me that the stories that landed with his readers were ones that named names, confirming that long-suspected officials had taken bribes or worked both sides of the table.\nThe more I spoke with the Mexican journalists, the more I became aware of the underlying issues going unaddressed in the courtroom. There were few mentions of the consequences of the war on drugs, which had led to the deaths of thousands of Mexicans. And because it was being held in the US, some saw the case as a finger in the eye of Mexican sovereignty, a serious injury to national pride. (There was some irritation over the fact that Guzmn was being tried, as several journalists grumbled, in a court where the judge couldnt properly pronounce his name.)\nAt the same time, nobody seemed to think the trial should have been held in Mexico, where the police and judicial systems were too weak to guarantee that Guzmn wouldnt escape jail for a third time. Again and again, I spoke with journalists and academics who described corruption in Mexico as something like a tide, a force that grew steadily and drew everything towards it. Police were underpaid, crime was lucrative and the government was compromised by the cartels. Political corruption, usually through campaign contributions or by laundering money through public procurement projects, is standard. When I asked people in Mexico City about the enthusiasm surrounding the new president Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador, who took office in December 2018, I often heard that his willingness to take on corruption was his main selling point.\nThe basic problem in Mexico, Buscaglia told me, is that nobody is policing the courts. Mexico doesnt audit judges or prosecutors, and lacks independent monitoring agencies. Despite recent reforms to the criminal justice system, Buscaglia does not think that Mexico currently has the capacity or political will to execute major organised crime cases like Italy did with its famous Maxi trial in the late 1980s. There, Sicilian prosecutors indicted 475 mafiosi over a six-year period. That, he added, indicates the most significant difference between Mexico and Italy: organised crime didnt infiltrate the Mexican state  it helped shape it. Politics in Mexico, Buscaglia likes to tell people, is the most sophisticated form of organised crime.\nDid the state shape the cartels, or was it the other way around? The standard narrative is that the cartels infiltrated the state, blurring the lines between police, politicians and traffickers. Others contend that government authorities exaggerated the power of the cartels in order to blame them for their own transgressions. It is possible some version of each is true. Either way, there is no single force in control.\nThere has never been a hard divide between the state and traffickers in Mexico. In the 1920s, farmers began growing poppy to meet US demand for opium, and after the second world war, representatives of what would become Mexicos Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) were rumoured to have made handshake deals with smugglers, allowing them to export illicit crops across the border in exchange for a cut of the profits. The PRI was the de facto government for most of the 20th century  the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa once called Mexico under the PRI the perfect dictatorship  and during its tenure, politicians generally took a lax attitude towards the drug trade, regarding drugs as more of a health issue than a criminal one.\nBy the 1980s, narcos had solidified their power by divvying up trafficking routes and letting groups run their own territories. At the time cocaine trafficking was starting to become big business in Mexico. When the US DEA began targeting Colombian cocaine distribution routes between the Caribbean and Miami, the cartels had found an alternative in the Mexican trampoline. Traffickers started moving shipments across the porous US-Mexico border, and American officials redirected their attention to Mexico. From 1985 onwards, US operations in Mexico became more aggressive, following the kidnap, torture and murder of a DEA agent by the Guadalajara cartel. With the cold war receding, drugs replaced communism as the enemy No 1 of the American people.\nThe Americans did not find the Mexican authorities the most co-operative of partners in the war on drugs. By the 80s and 90s, writes the sociologist Luis Alejandro Astorga Almanza, it was practically impossible for society to ignore the unbreakable links between police and traffickers. Particularly in states such as Tamaulipas, cops would moonlight as traffickers  and traffickers as cops  with the tacit blessing of local authorities and elites. Various governmental structures seem to have been born captured by the illicit interests of their own creators, writes Carlos Antonio Flores Perz, a social anthropologist who studies the institutional protection of the drug trade. US army intelligence cables from the 80s and early 90s reveal that American officials were fully aware that all over Mexico, officials, politicians and state and federal police were in on the take.\nIn April 1989, Miguel ngel Flix Gallardo, the former police officer who founded the infamous Guadalajara cartel, was arrested, but like Escobar, he continued to run his cartel from prison. That year, his most powerful lieutenants  one of whom was a young Guzmn  assembled in Acapulco and were each assigned a territory. El Chapo and El Mayo took the Pacific coast. This kingmaker moment ushered in a new era, and preceded yet another big shift. Instead of continuing to accept cash from weakened Colombian suppliers, Mexican narcos began demanding payment in cocaine so they could go into business on their own. Before long, they went from being couriers to distributors, which was far more profitable, and overtook their former employers as the worlds biggest traffickers.\nWhile agreements between cartels and Mexican authorities had previously kept violence between the two at bay, by the late 80s these relationships were strained. With the US putting more pressure on the Mexican government to target traffickers, the old arrangements dissolved. Under these new circumstances, violence became common among gangs, writes Sinaloan historian Froyln Enciso, and a way of confronting the government.\nStill, it rarely spilled into public view. So the country was stunned when in May 1993, a Mexican cardinal was killed in a shootout between the Tijuana and Sinaloa cartels at Guadalajara airport. Although it was later discovered that Tijuana sicarios had mistaken the cardinals car for Guzmns  they were retaliating for a Sinaloa attack that killed nine Tijuana members  he was initially blamed. A nationwide manhunt was called, and with Guzmn splashed all over the papers, he became a household name in Mexico.\nIn June 1993, he was captured in Guatemala, extradited to Mexico and later sentenced to 20 years in jail for drug trafficking and murder. But for the next eight years, until he escaped in 2001  allegedly hidden in a laundry cart pushed by a guard  Guzmn, like Flix Gallardo before him, continued to run his business from jail without any difficulties.\nIn the early 2000s, after Guzmns first escape from jail, Sinaloa began to expand. The organisation moved into the markets for meth and fentanyl and, as opioid addiction gained momentum in the US, Guzmn approached it like a shrewd businessman. According to Jack Riley, the former DEA head in Chicago, between 2010 and 2014, the cartel increased the flow of Colombian and Mexican heroin because [Guzmn] saw the prescription drug problem taking over.\nWhile this pattern played out across the US, Sinaloas power and logistical strength were concentrated in Chicago, the main hub from which they distributed drugs around the country. Cartel operations were so well organised, said Riley, that you could hit a house with 50 kilos of heroin in it, and two doors down you could hit a house with $5m in it, and neither of the people running the houses even knew the other existed.\nEven as Sinaloa grew, Mexico was relatively peaceful. From the 1990s until 2006, Mexicos homicide rate fell by nearly half, reaching the lowest levels in its history. Then, in late 2006, everything changed. Just over a week after the conservative Felipe Caldern took office, following a bitterly controversial election that he won by a margin of just 0.6%, he declared an internal war on drugs, sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacn. To his critics, this new war on drugs looked like a bid to divert attention from accusations of election fraud.\nCalderns announcement initiated what would become one of the deadliest periods in Mexican history. With billions in funding from the US, Caldern pursued his own version of the kingpin strategy, deploying the military to fight cartels and targeting their leaders. During his six-year tenure, 25 of Mexicos most wanted  two-thirds of the entire list  were arrested or killed. As cartels pushed back, extortion and kidnappings spiked, and the number of homicides reached an average of 20,000 a year. In this new atmosphere of fear, wrote novelist Juan Villoro in an essay about the era, 10,000 companies offer security services and 3,000 people have had chips inserted under their skin so they can be located if theyre kidnapped.\nDespite this violence, Sinaloa seemed to receive less attention from the authorities than other cartels. An investigation by the US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR) reported that between December 2006 and May 2010, Sinaloa members were arrested at significantly lower rates than those of rival groups. A congressman from Sinaloa also told NPR that the government has been fighting organised crime in many parts of the republic, but has not touched Sinaloa. Explanations for this varied from low-level corruption in the armed forces to more elaborate conspiracies involving the government  accusations that Caldern told reporters were totally unfounded, naming various Sinaloa members that the government had arrested.\nIn the next general election, in 2012, the PRI retook power and Pea Nieto became president. Although his administration retreated from the kingpin strategy, in 2014, more than a decade after he had first escaped from prison, Guzmn was recaptured and sent to the maximum-security Altiplano federal prison. The following year, he escaped once again, before he was recaptured for the final time in 2016. Mission complete, tweeted Pea Nieto.\nAfter a year of negotiations and intense international pressure, Guzmn was extradited to New York in January 2017. If his capture had any effect on the violence in Mexico, it wasnt immediately positive: 2017 was the deadliest year in modern Mexican history, with a total of 23,101 homicides. It is not clear exactly how many of these deaths and disappearances were linked to organised crime, but scholars have noted that a culture of impunity certainly contributed to the violence. Less than 2% of homicide cases in Mexico result in indictments. By the time Pea Nieto left office in 2018, the number of people killed since 2006 had risen above 250,000, with a further 31,000 declared missing. Targeting leaders had fractured the cartel landscape, and new gangs were rushing in to fill the gaps.\nDrug trafficking and cartel violence affect both the US and Mexico, but when it comes to addressing them, the US government has typically strongarmed Mexico into following its lead. Long before the overt bullying of the Trump administration, American officials were known to pay little heed to Mexican sovereignty. Yet even when US violations of that sovereignty pertained to the trial, they were rarely discussed in court.\nOne notable example was the Fast and Furious scandal, which the judge in Guzmns trial explicitly barred from mention on the grounds that it would confuse the jury. In this staggeringly ill-advised scheme, US law enforcement agents encouraged gun dealers in Arizona to sell to traffickers believed to be connected to the Mexican cartels, in order to track the weapons and see where they ended up. The first part of this plan succeeded. Between 2009 and 2011, more than 2,000 weapons were purchased in the gunwalking operation, and it erupted into the news when a border agent was killed with one. A congressional review later revealed that ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives] leadership knew that Fast and Furious weapons were heading to the Sinaloa cartel, and Attorney General [Eric] Holder was sent several memos in 2010 notifying him that the Sinaloa cartel was buying them. An estimated 150 injuries and homicides resulted from the programme, and one of the weapons, a Barrett .50-calibre rifle, was found in Guzmns hideout after he was last captured.\nEven in less dramatic instances, the business as usual of international law enforcement is fraught. Writing for El Proceso, J Jess Esquivel described the Guzmn trial as having exposed betrayals, corruption, lies and regular violations of Mexican sovereignty by DEA agents. Esquivel also zeroed in on cooperating witness deals that the justice department offered to certain traffickers, including Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of El Mayo and Sinaloas heir apparent. El Vicentillo was one of the trials most anticipated witnesses. He was flown in from Chicago, where he had yet to be sentenced on his own trafficking charges, and took the stand in dark blue prison clothes. In a five-hour testimony that the New York Times described as a spectacular betrayal of his father and birthright, Zambada Niebla gave a detailed insider account of cartel workings, describing how the organisation spent at least $1m a month on bribes to police and politicians, and detailing a failed plot to use a government petrol tanker to transport South American cocaine to Mexico.\nFor taking the stand against his compadre, as he politely referred to Guzmn, the 44-year-old was promised a shorter sentence and a possible path to US citizenship. Others were given similar offers. The Cifuentes brothers, who sent tonnes of drugs to cities all over the US, may serve less than 15 years for their cooperation. Even Chupeta, the Colombian trafficker who confessed to having ordered the killings of 150 people  and to having personally shot one man in the face  may be free in 10-15 years for his testimony.\nIn his plea agreement, Zambada Niebla also agreed to forfeit $1.37bn (yes, billion) to the US government, although it is highly unlikely any money will actually change hands. Since narcos dont purchase property or open bank accounts in their own names, it can be difficult to locate assets, and if the money is in Mexico, US authorities rarely bother to track it down. Of course, there is no public information about how many narcos are in witness protection, or whether those living under assumed identities have managed to recoup some of their former fortunes. But it is not far-fetched to assume this could happen: on 30 May, a federal judge in Chicago sentenced Vicentillo to 15 years in prison. With time served, this leaves him with five years to go, which may be further reduced for good behaviour.\nOutside the courtroom, away from the trial, the US-Mexico relationship is also defined by a kind of mutual obliviousness on the part of each countrys citizens. David Brooks, the Jornada reporter, told me there is still mass ignorance about whats happening next door. In Mexico, he observed, Trump coming to power reinforced every stereotype of America for the past hundred years. At the same time, while there are 36 million Mexican Americans in the US, Americans are generally ignorant of whats happening below the border. One thing that has gone notably unnoticed, according to Brooks, is the victory of left populist Lpez Obrador. Since he took office in December 2018, Mexico has entered a moment of potential transformation, which, if the new president follows through on his promises, could reshape the way Mexico deals with drug trafficking.\nA month after the verdict, I met journalist Ioan Grillo in the middle-class area of Roma in Mexico City, several blocks from the house where Alfonso Cuarn had shot his Oscar-winning film, and next to a Sinaloan seafood restaurant. Grillo had recently written an opinion piece rejecting the idea that Guzmns conviction was a victory in the war on drugs. To bring a real sense of justice, youd need something like a war crimes tribunal, he observed. Grillo was building on a point that had been made repeatedly by members of the Mexican press at the trial  the case did not seem not to acknowledge how the war on drugs led to thousands of deaths and profoundly altered Mexican society.\nThere were mixed feelings in Mexico, Grillo added  not about whether Guzmn should go to jail, but about what justice should look like, what closure his conviction could offer and what the whole trial ultimately meant. This was the biggest trial in a drug war that has lasted more than a decade, and it didnt even take place in Mexico. No actionable evidence against any officials had emerged, and Grillo said most Mexicans were not particularly surprised to hear any of the corruption allegations that the case brought to the surface.\nEl Chapos capture did not have any impact on drug trafficking or consumption, and there is no reason to think his sentence will, either. In 2018, a DEA report found that drug overdoses in the US had hit record highs, and that cocaine and heroin use was on the rise. In Mexico, where drug use has historically been very low, the numbers are steadily climbing: in 2016, 9.9% of the population said they had tried illegal drugs, up from 4.1% in 2002. Moreover, under the leadership of El Mayo and Guzmns sons, Ivn and Alfredo, Sinaloa has continued to operate. Just as the trial was ending, Arizona officials announced the largest fentanyl seizure in history from a truck coming from Sinaloa territory; and, in mid-April, a presidential candidate in Guatemala was arrested for accepting a bribe from the Sinaloa cartel in exchange for appointing their people to high-ranking government positions.\nWhat is changing in Mexico is the nature of violence. Kate Linthicum, the Mexico City bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times, says that in the past several years she has watched violence become more localised in small gangs and contract criminals with shifting affiliations. This has corresponded with a rise in narcomenudeo, small-scale street trafficking and other forms of crime, including petrol theft. Because Mexicos petrol industry is nationalised, the robberies cost the government more than $3bn a year. Since Lpez Obrador made it one of his signature issues, petrol theft has become a front-page staple. The thieves are usually associated with local gangs or cartels, and are often assisted by Mexican Petroleum employees. At the beginning of January, Lpez Obrador shut off Mexican Petroleum pipelines to stop smuggling, causing a national shortage that lasted for days. This enraged petrol cartels, but burnished his popularity: a national poll found that more than 80% of Mexicans approved of the move.\nIt is clear the public wants reform, but the question is whether Lpez Obrador will be able to do anything about the corruption that has for so long hobbled the state, including parts of his own administration. Three days after Guzmns sentencing, Lpez Obrador visited Badiraguato, the kingpins hometown. Guzmn is by no means a popular figure in Mexico, but in Sinaloa, one of the countrys most dangerous regions, T-shirts with his face on them are sold in markets and he is widely regarded as a local hero. In a state where the federal government is largely absent, El Chapo is credited (without any evidence) with building roads and providing social services. After he was apprehended for the second time in 2014, hundreds of people turned out to demand his release.\nDuring his visit, Lpez Obrador promised jobs to the towns young people and vowed to make sure that they would not be obliged to take antisocial paths. That was four months ago. The jobs havent yet materialised, but it was the first time residents could recall a president visiting the region.\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.', 'description': 'The long read: As the capture and conviction of Mexicos notorious drug lord has shown, taking down the boss doesnt mean taking down the organisation', 'source_domain': 'www.theguardian.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-PER', 'word': 'Joaquin'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': ""'""}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': 'El'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': 'Cha'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': '##po'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': ""'""}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': 'G'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': '##uz'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': '##man'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Mexico'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 2, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.bbc.com', 'www.theguardian.com'], 'dates': ['2016-01-09T10:11:15', '2019-06-07T05:00:15'], 'languages': ['', '']}",2

Electricity and gas prices may go up\nAlthough there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there are likely to be significant price rises for businesses and households, the government\'s Yellowhammer report warns.\nThe market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets.\nYellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit.\nThe warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which said the UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages in the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nThe risk would arise as a result of the UK\'s exit from the EU\'s Internal Energy Market, it said.\nThe bulk of the UK\'s natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless.\n3. You will need to take extra measures when travelling to Europe\nMillions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe.\nIf you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork.\nTravel to Ireland will not change, even if there\'s no deal. You\'ll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before.\nPassports\nThe government is advising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months if you are travelling to most countries in Europe - the full list is here.\nUntil recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document.\nBut the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time left with this government tool.\nYou\'ll need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks.\nVisas\nYou won\'t need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study.\nWhen new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be on each country\'s travel advice page.\nBorder control\nThe government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to:\nshow a return or onward ticket\nshow you have enough money for your stay\nuse separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens\nThe government\'s Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports.\nEuropean health cover\nIn addition, if there is no deal, then in theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist.\nThe government is advising travellers ""whether there\'s a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"".\nMinisters say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition. This is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not.\nTravel\nHowever you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption.\nIf you intend to drive in the EU, you\'ll need some extra documents:\na ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company)\na GB sticker\nan International Driving Permit for some countries (you can check if you need one on the Post Office website)\nThe government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal.\nAn earlier government assessment had warned of long queues at London\'s St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensure their services run as smoothly as possible.\nHowever, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run.\nPets\nAfter Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow a different process, involving a number of vet\'s tests. The process could take up to four months.\nBank cards\nIf you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the government has warned that it may become more expensive.\n4. You may need to check medication is available and it may be more expensive\nWhile there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse.\nThe government\'s Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can\'t because of their short shelf life, it says.\nMore than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, and about 7,000 come from or via the EU.\nMinisters and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU.\nThe government has announced a further 434m of funding and other measures, including:\nextra warehouse space for medicines\nsecuring additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone\nbuilding buffer stocks\nbooking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment\nmaking changes to regulatory requirements\nstrengthening processes to deal with shortages\nHowever, the National Audit Office has said there are still ""significant"" gaps in the government\'s preparation regarding the NHS and care homes.\n5. UK nationals living abroad may have to take extra measures\nAbout 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries.\nThe UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now.\nIn event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services.\nHowever, the government\'s Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"".\nThe government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing 138m.\nIt advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevant country advice pages.\nHealth\nUK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country.\nHowever, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority.\nIts Yellowhammer report warns that while EU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".\nInformation on how to access healthcare abroad can be found on the NHS website.\nPensions\nThe UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU.\nTax\nThe UK\'s exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries.\nThese ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights.\nDrivers\nUK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live.\n6. EU citizens need to apply for \'settled status\'\nThe UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK.\nThere are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS).\nThe ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum.\nStatisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline.\nIf you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has a tool to find out what you need to do and when.\nHome Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned that the UK will deport EU citizens after Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time.\n7. Importing goods from the EU may get more expensive\nImporting goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK\'s departure.\nAs a member of the EU, UK firms don\'t have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU.\nBut after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world.\nIndividuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than 135.\nIn March, the government published a 1,477-page document outlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published an update to the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy.\nA tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods.\nUnder the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free.\n8. House prices could be affected\nThe Bank of England says the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant.\nIt has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10% fall in house prices by 2021 in the event of no-deal.\nBut bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder.\n9. Some ports and motorways could see extra delays\nUp to 85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days, the government\'s Yellowhammer report warns.\nThese queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months.\nEven after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said.\nRemind yourself of the Brexit basics with:\nIn the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side.\nIf that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used.\nKent County Council says it has employed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal.\nTo ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that 88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system.\nThe government has also announced 344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations.\n10. UK students studying in the EU and EU students studying in the UK face a period of uncertainty\nMore than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17.\nUK universities say they would expect a similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.\nThe government and the EU have agreed that people who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them.\nThis is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK.\nThe government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun.\nInstitutions are being advised to apply for this ""HMG guarantee"" to ensure they get the funding.\nMeanwhile, Universities UK has launched a campaign supporting opportunities for studying abroad.', 'description': 'From your weekly shop to your holiday plans, how could a no-deal Brexit affect you?', 'source_domain': 'www.bbc.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-MISC', 'word': 'British'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Dover'}, {'entity': 'B-ORG', 'word': 'E'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'U'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.bbc.com'], 'dates': ['2019-03-11T11:30:43'], 'languages': ['']}",1

"Plant manager Jo Dickinson tends the plants at Forest Lodge Garden Centre in Farnham, Surrey",0,1,2,6.3833019733428955,"[{'title': 'The USDAs gardening zones shifted. This map shows you whats changed in vivid detail', 'date': '2024-08-08T18:34:27', 'content': 'This measurement, which predicts an areas coldest temperatures, is only useful for plants that have to survive the winter.\nTheyre called perennials: You plant them once and they come back after each winter if theyre given the right environment to survive. Think things like trees, shrubs and woody plants.\nWindmill palm\nzones 7-11\nHydrangea\nzones 3-9\nAzalea\nzones 6-9\nLavender\nzones 5-9\nWindmill palm\nzones 7-11\nHydrangea\nzones 3-9\nAzalea\nzones 6-9\nLavender\nzones 5-9\nWindmill palm\nzones 7-11\nHydrangea\nzones 3-9\nAzalea\nzones 6-9\nLavender\nzones 5-9\nAnd for predicting winter plant survival, knowing an areas hardiness zone is a big help to gardeners, says Todd Rounsaville, a horticulturist with the USDA who was involved with creating the new map. He explains that the hardiness zone is really one of the best predictors of winter survival and plant survival in general in the landscape.\nHe advises gardeners to use the map as one very important tool of many in their risk assessment toolbox.\nBecause the USDA map has really become the industry standard for rating things, its pretty rare that you will not see a zone rating on a plant, either on the tag or on a website, he says.\nKnowing what your average coldest temperature is helps rightsize your expectations about what might grow in your area. Live in Chicagos Zone 6a? You can be assured that no citrus plants will survive your winter. Instead, try an apple tree. The apple tree is that kid you grew up with who wore shorts all winter. It needs the cold temperatures to set fruit.\nLive in Miamis Zone 11a? No apples for you. Instead, grow dragon fruit!\nWhat does your hardiness zone not tell you?\nOn its own, your hardiness zone cant tell you exactly what to grow in your area.\nFor example, parts of these three areas  Juneau, Alaska; Boston, Mass.; and Santa Fe, N.M.  are all in USDAs Zone 7a.\nJuneau, Alaska\nBoston, Mass.\nSanta Fe, N.M.\nJuneau, Alaska\nBoston, Mass.\nSanta Fe, N.M.\nJuneau,\nAlaska\nBoston,\nMass.\nSanta Fe,\nN.M.\nWe know intuitively that the same plants cant grow in these places, Rounsaville says.\nWhile Juneau may have relatively temperate winters, it also is extremely wet, averaging over 80 inches of snow a year. Santa Fe, on the other hand, is extremely dry, with much hotter summer temperatures than Juneau. Boston has both temperate winters and summers. It gets a good amount of rain but not nearly enough to sustain Juneaus rainforest plants. It gets plenty of heat but is colder and wetter in the winter, making it inhospitable for desert dwellers, like cactuses and other succulents.\nBut all three cities rarely get below zero degrees each winter, so they are classified as the same zone.\nSo when you hear that your zone has changed, here are some things to keep in mind:\n1 The hardiness map says nothing about your extreme lowest temperature\nJust because your average lowest winter temperature has changed, doesnt mean the temperature will never dip below your hardiness zone.\n2 The hardiness map says nothing about the frequency of extreme cold weather\nYour poor plants have to stay outside all winter, so the duration and frequency of cold weather matters for plant survival.\nIf youre naked and you run through a freezer, its not going to kill you, says Andrew Bunting, vice president of horticulture at the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. If you run into the freezer and have to stay there for an extended period of time, its probably going to kill you.\nIf extreme, out-of-zone weather occurs during a quick cold snap, steps can be taken to protect your plants with temporary blankets or other shelters. Pots can be brought inside.\nBut if the extreme lows persist, tender plants will struggle to survive. Your hardiness zone does not take any of this into account.\n3 The hardiness map cant tell you if your plants will survive the summer\nSummer temperature extremes matter a great deal but are not reflected in the USDA hardiness map.\nLets look again at Juneau and Santa Fe, much of which are in Zone 7a. Juneaus all-time high temperature was 90 F in 1975. Summer days in Santa Fe routinely reach the 90s. Some shade- and cool-weather-loving plants like ferns and hostas will thrive in Juneau but struggle mightily in a place like Santa Fe. Likewise, a cactus accustomed to high temperatures would struggle to thrive in the cooler summer temperatures of Juneau, to say nothing of the overwhelming rainfall.\nBecause of this tricky problem, there have been attempts to create a corresponding map that helps gardeners know which plants might survive summer in their area.\nIn 1997, the American Horticultural Society released a heat zone map that measured the average number of times per year that the temperature of an area exceeds 86 F.\nAmerican Horticultural Society\nBut this map didnt become well known among gardeners. On a recent visit to a plant nursery outside Washington, D.C., nearly every plant tag had a USDA hardiness zone, but only one, out of the several dozen checked, had the AHS heat zone listed.\nAbove 86 F, plants from cooler climates rapidly become stressed.\nBecause of these complexities, more plant survival factors should be included in the 2023 map, says Tony Avent, who runs Juniper Level Botanic Garden and Plant Delights Nursery in Raleigh, N.C.\nIf [these metrics] had been factored in, that would have given you a much more applicable map, says Avent, who was a member of the committee that put together the 2012 version of the map.\nAnd thats the part thats a little disappointing.\nBut including more plant survival factors in the USDA hardiness map runs the risk of creating an overly complicated map and muddying its intended use, Rounsaville says.\nIn a perfect world, we could infinitely break down where plants will grow well, but thats very hard to do and produce a map that is, you know, coherent but at a local resolution, Rounsaville says.\nSince the USDA plant hardiness zone cant tell you everything about how a plant will fare in your garden, its a good idea to turn to local plant experts for guidance. Local nurseries and botanical gardens can be great resources for in-depth knowledge of the area and recent warming or cooling trends.\nNew plant varieties are constantly being bred with improvements such as increased hardiness, bloom count, bloom length or color combinations.\nSome nursery owners like Avent enjoy experimenting with these plants. He and his team grow many varieties of plants  both typical and unconventional  to figure out which plants they can bring to market in Raleigh.\nWe live to kill plants, Avent says. He estimates that theyve killed over 50,000 plant varieties in his career. Every one they kill, they record in a database.\nIf my zone changed, can I plant new things now?\nMaybe, and maybe you already did! Its possible you or your neighbors may have already noticed some of these climatic changes and have been experimenting with plant varieties that were once unusual for your area.\nKeep in mind that the new USDA map is backward looking; it represents changes that have already taken place over the past 30 years.\nIn the 7a-7b Philadelphia suburbs, Bunting notes two perennials that he has noticed surviving Philadelphia winters in recent years.\nIt used to be [that] if you had a camellia, it was in a little courtyard with lots of protection, maybe even wrapped [in protective cloth] for the winter. But now, Its perfectly hardy. Same with figs. People used to wrap figs. You dont have to do that anymore.\nOf course, your mileage may vary. As Bunting notes, where you plant a perennial in your yard  whether sheltered or in the open  matters. Some areas get southern exposure and lots of sun, others are behind a house, or under a tree. Every yard has many distinct microclimates, and learning how to harness these subtle differences in your yard can help you plant more ambitious varieties with more confidence.\nGardeners know that if theyre near paved surfaces or brick and mortar structures, that theres a lot of radiant heat that those absorb during the day, Rounsaville says. And they can really push hardiness zones through the winter to help with plant survival.', 'description': ""There's a good chance your zone shifted when the USDA updated its plant hardiness map in 2023.

The ceremony happened at noon local time (7 a.m. Eastern time) and lasted about an hour.\n3\nAnd where was it?\nBen Stansall/Getty Images\n\nAt St. Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle.\n4\nIs that near Buckingham Palace?\nNope. Buckingham Palace is in London. Windsor Castle is in Windsor, a picturesque old town some 20 miles west of London. Windsor is also known for its proximity to Eton College, which is the boarding school Harry and William attended.\n5\nWere William and Kate married at Buckingham Palace?\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\nNope again. On April 29, 2011, William and Kate (which is what the British papers call her, even though her official name is Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge) were married at Westminster Abbey, a church that is in London and a 15-minute walk from Buckingham Palace.\n6\nCould I have gone to the wedding?\nSorry, but no, unless you were one of about 600 personal guests who got to sit in the chapel, or among the several thousand who were invited to stand on the grounds of Windsor Castle to watch the wedding party enter and leave. That group included members of the royal household, local school children and regular people who work for charities, community organizations and the like.\n7\nWhen did the invitations go out?\nOn March 22, invitations went out to about 600 guests. The ink was American, the card stock was English and the invitations were printed by Barnard and Westwood, if youre into that sort of thing.\nVictoria Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\n8\nWhat if my invitation was lost in the mail?\nThe non-invitees were able to congregate around the town of Windsor with other eager to catch a glimpse of the couple.\n9\nHow can I watch the wedding?\nYou can watch the whole thing right here!\n10\nDo we know who any of the guests were?\nJustin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere were a number of predictable attendees: Harrys grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip; his father and stepmother, Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall; various cousins, like Zara and Peter Phillips and Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice; and of course his brother and sister-in-law, William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\nThen, of course, there were members of royal families from other countries. Theyre all on a big royal-family-wedding circuit, traveling around to one others ceremonies. And, since this is as much public celebration as private service, guests will include representatives from British charities, churches and armed forces; government officials, past and present; and dignitaries from other countries.\nAs for nonroyals, Harry has a posse of boisterous friends  Guy Pelly, Tom Inskip and Thomas van Straubenzee, among others.\nAnd there were celebrities: Serena Williams, Priyanka Chopra, Oprah, Victoria and David Beckham, Elton John, Amal and George Clooney and Carey Mulligan were among them.\n11\nWas Donald Trump invited to the royal wedding?\nNope!\nIt has been decided that an official list of political leaders  both U.K. and international  is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markles wedding, Kensington Palace said in a statement.

See above.\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\n13\nWas there a dress code for guests?\nYes! According to the invitations, men were supposed to wear uniforms, morning coats or lounge suits, by which they mean, essentially, business suits. Women were expected to wear day dresses  dresses that arent evening gowns  and hats. The hats are often highly amusing, resembling (depending on how you look at them) flying saucers, plant pots, teacups, hedges, bathing caps, Calder mobiles, frisbees, pyramids, fezzes  you name it. Here you can see some of the many hats from William and Kates wedding.\n14\nIm not into fashion. What else can I get excited about?\nAll weddings are a-swirl with all manner of uninformed gossip about the guests: Who knows whom, why they are sitting in their particular spots, which ones slept with/dated/still pine for the bride or the groom. Even better, it will be a prime occasion to revisit the talk about the intrigues, allegiances and feuds within the royal family itself.\nAlso, there was always the chance that Prince Philip would say something completely inappropriate.\n15\nWho planned the royal wedding?\nThe couple made it clear that they were responsible for much of the overall tone of the day. That said, the Lord Chamberlains Office, which is the department of Buckingham Palace responsible for all public events  state visits, palace garden parties and the like  oversaw all the necessary logistical and ceremonial details. The office is comparable in many ways to that of the White House social secretary.\n16\nWho performed the ceremony?\nThe Right Rev. David Conner, also known as the dean of Windsor, is the spiritual head of St. Georges Chapel performed the service. The Most Rev. and Right Honorable Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and the Most Rev. Michael Curry, the first African-American leader of the Episcopal Church, officiated the vows. Bishop Curry gave a powerful speech, citing Martin Luther King Jr. several times.\n17\nWho writes the vows for a royal wedding?\nRoyal weddings usually follow a rigid script of words and rituals based on the traditional Anglican wedding ceremony prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer.\n18\nLets back up. How did Harry and Meghan meet?\nThey say they met in London in July 2016, on a blind date organized by a mutual friend. A few weeks later, he whisked her off to Botswana, where they camped out with each other under the stars, Harry said afterward in an interview with the BBC (see below). They then had a few months of long-distance dating, visiting each other in Britain and in Toronto, where Meghan was filming Suits.\n19\nWhen did their relationship become public?\nThat November, Prince Harrys office issued a statement identifying Meghan as his girlfriend and denouncing the racist and sexist undertones of some newspaper coverage and social media commentary. Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markles safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her, the statement said.\n20\nI want to hear them tell their story in their own words.\nWatch this post-engagement interview with the BBC:\nBBC News\n21\nO.K., so tell me about Meghan Markles engagement ring.\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\nThe ring was designed by Harry himself and comprises a large central diamond from Botswana and some smaller diamonds that belonged to his late mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales.\nAs he explained: The little diamonds [on] either side are from my mothers jewelry collection, to make sure that shes with us on this crazy journey together.\n22\nDid Queen Elizabeth II need to give permission?\nYes. Anyone who is one of six persons next in line of succession to the Crown must receive the queens permission to get married, according to Section 3 of the Succession to the Crown Act.\n23\nSo did she sign off?\nYes. In mid-March, the queen issued her formal declaration of consent at a meeting of the Privy Council. It read as follows: My lords, I declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between My Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle, which Consent I am causing to be signified under the Great Seal and to be entered in the Books of the Privy Council.\nAnd it wasnt only the queen who approved. The corgis took to you straight away, Harry told Meghan in the BBC interview, referring to his grandmothers beloved dogs. For the last 33 years, I\'ve been barked at. This one walks in and absolutely nothing. Just wagging tails.\n24\nWhy was this wedding important?\nIt was not important. For one thing, Harry is currently only sixth in line for the throne, after the birth of Kate and Williams third child, Prince Louis Arthur Charles, on April 23. Barring the unlikely event that all the people ahead of him  the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth;\nPrince Charles;\nPrince William;\nand Williams two children, Prince George and\nPrincess Charlotte,\nas well as their third child, Prince Louis\n are eliminated in some sort of Kind Hearts and Coronets scenario, he has no chance of ever being king. And to be honest, British monarchs have nothing like the kind of power that they used to.\n25\nSo why should we care?\nBecause Harry, being unconstrained by the responsibilities that burden his older brother, William, has recovered from some earlier lapses in judgment to bring a delightfully racy and joyously improvisational approach to his royal life. And because Meghan is so different from most royal brides-to-be: She is American, biracial (her mother is African-American and her father is white), divorced and 36, which makes her three years older than her Harry.\n26\nHow significant is the fact that Meghan is biracial?\nPeople of color are underrepresented in British politics and not represented at all in the royal family. Many have said they are thrilled to see someone like themselves in Meghans position.\nThe idea has resonated across the Atlantic, too, with #blackprincess gaining traction on Twitter and Instagram the day the engagement was announcement. (Meghan will probably be a duchess, not a princess, but its a matter of semantics.)\n27\nWould it be at all possible to surf this website without such cutting-edge art direction?\n28\nHow do Kate and Meghan get along?\nBy all accounts, the soon-to-be sisters-in-law get along just fine. Theyre neighbors at Kensington Palace and have appeared happily together on several occasions since Meghan and Harrys engagement was announced.\n29\nWhats this about them being neighbors?\nHarry and Meghan currently live in Nottingham Cottage, a (relatively) modest two-bedroom home on the grounds of Kensington Palace, in London.\n30\nWhats the difference between Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace again?\nDaniel Leal-Olivas/Getty Images\nKensington Palace is a royal residence that is currently home to not just Harry and Meghan, but William, Kate and their children, as well as several other members of the royal family. Buckingham Palace is the home of Harrys grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n31\nDid Meghan have a bachelorette party?\nIts rumored that she had a spa-themed hen do (thats British for bachelorette party) at the Soho Farmhouse, which is a countryside arm of the members-only Soho House, in March.\n32\nDid she have bridesmaids?\nMeghan was accompanied by six bridesmaids and four page boys, ranging in age from 2 to 7. The bridesmaids were 3-year-old Princess Charlotte; 3-year-old Florence van Cutsem and 2-year-old Zalie Warren (both goddaughters of Prince Harry); 7-year-old Rylan Litt and 6-year-old Remi Litt (both goddaughters of Meghan); and 4-year-old Ivy Mulroney (daughter of the stylist Jessica Mulroney, Meghans close pal, and her husband Ben). The page boys were 4-year-old Prince George, 6-year-old Jasper Dyer (godson of Prince Harry), and 7-year-old twins Brian and John Mulroney (brothers to Ivy).\nMeghan did not have a maid of honor, because she is simply too popular and all her friends love her: She has a very close-knit circle of friends and she didnt want to choose one over another, said the spokesman. When the Duchess of Cambridge had her younger sister Pippa Middleton as her maid of honor, that was more of an exception than a rule. Royal weddings rarely feature adult female bridesmaids.\n33\nWere Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the wedding?\nJustin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\nSee above! And Prince Louis Arthur Charles, born on April 23, did not participate.\n34\nDo Harry and Meghan want kids?\nSounds like it. In their post-engagement interview with the BBC, Prince Harry said, Of course, one step at a time and hopefully well start a family in the near future.\n35\nWhat are Harry and Meghans new titles?\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex! Its a title that has not been used in the royal family since 1843.\nNational Portrait Gallery of London\n36\nSo what name will be on Meghans drivers license?\nBest guess is Rachel Meghan Mountbatten Windsor. Windsor is the last name adopted by the British royal family in 1917; King George V changed the name from the German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the English Windsor amid strong anti-German feeling during World War I. And Prince Philip distanced himself from his familys ultra-German names  Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glcksburg  in the wake of World War II. Thats when he adopted the quasi-English surname Mountbatten from his mothers side.\n37\nWho are Meghans parents?\nHer mother, Doria Loyce Ragland is a social worker and yoga instructor who lives in California. Her father, Thomas Markle, Sr., is a lighting director who worked in California for years but now lives in Mexico. The two divorced in 1988.\n38\nWhere is Meghan from?\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Meghan is a true California girl.\n39\nDoes Meghan have brothers or sisters?\nShe has two older paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr. In February, her 51-year-old half-brother told In Touch Weekly that he had contacted the palace for advice on dealing with the press after Meghans engagement was announced. He then claimed that his lawyer received a response from Meghan that said: Thats distant family and I dont know those people. Odds are hes not at the top of the guest list.\n40\nAnd who was Meghans first husband?\nHis name is Trevor Engelson, and Meghan dated him for seven years before marrying him on the beach in Jamaica in 2011. (A mere 100 guests attended that wedding; the marriage was over two years later.) After Meghan got engaged again, Mr. Engelson reportedly began work on a TV pilot about a divorcee who marries a prince. What are the odds?\n41\nAnd who has Harry dated?\nThe prince was known for his penchant for blondes until he met Meghan. For seven years he dated Chelsy Davy, a Zimbabwean lawyer turned jeweler. Then there was the aristocratic actress Cressida Bonas. Both attended the wedding. He also dated British singer Ellie Goulding.\n42\nWho designed Meghan Markles wedding dress?\nClare Waight Keller for Givenchy is the lucky winner.\nThe running favorite, at least according to the gossipy fashion industry, was the brand Ralph & Russo. Meghan chose a dress made by the London couture house for her official engagement portraits, and the brand is known for its over-the-top wedding dresses, which now account for around 30 percent of annual revenue. Beloved by Beyonc, the Kardashians, Angelina Jolie and  last but not least!  Kylie Minogue, the brand was valued at more than $285 million in 2014 and introduced a sell-out range of accessories in 2015 and in 2016.\nvia Twitter\n\n43\nWere there any other contenders?\nErdem Moralioglu, a Canadian-Turkish designer known for his romantic designs, was another rumored contender. Erdem commands a glittering A-list clientele, recently produced a sold-out H&M collaboration and already counts Meghan as a firm fan (in a Vanity Fair interview last year she mentioned him as a designer Ive been wearing for years). Oh, and his most recent show, at London Fashion Week in February, was inspired by the tale of an American actress who marries an aristocrat. Sound familiar?\nAs a reminder, when Kate married William in 2011, she wore a spectacular dress with a nine-foot train designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, and a tiara borrowed from the actual queen. (The dress was said to have cost the paint-peeling sum of $434,000 to make.)\n44\nWhat did Harry wear?\nA frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals by Dege & Skinner. Read more about it here.\nHarry received the title of Captain General Royal Marines in 2017, which means he is ceremonial head of the Royal Marines (he took over the job from his grandpa, Prince Philip). More pertinently, hes an officer in the Blues and Royals, part of the Army Air Corps, which is why he ended up wearing one of their uniforms. (Prince William wore a scarlet Irish Guards Mounted Officers uniform at his.)\n45\nWhat about the cake?\nBritish weddings usually feature fruitcakes.\nBarry Batchelor/Getty Images\nThrowing aside this strange and perverse custom, the couple decided to serve organic lemon elderflower cake that will be covered in buttercream icing and fresh flowers and is meant to incorporate the bright flavours of spring. It was made by the hip Violet bakery in the (even hipper) London borough of Hackney. The owner and baker, Claire Ptak, who was raised in California and believes in using seasonal, organic ingredients, said on Instagram that the couple both share so many of the same values regarding food provenance, sustainability, seasonality and of course, flavour!\n46\nAnd the flowers?\nOn March 31, it was announced that the couple had chosen white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves for their wedding day floral displays.\nThe bouquets, decorations and garlands will be designed by the florist Philippa Craddock, Kensington Palace said in a statement. Ms. Craddock is a favorite of the fashion world and has done floral arrangements for Jenny Packhams runway show, a Star Wars after-party, Dior events and more.\nDominic Lipinski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe displays will use flowers and foliage taken from the gardens of the royal palaces and Windsor Great Park, and reflect the wild and natural landscapes from which many of the plants will be picked from, and Ms. Craddock will work alongside a team of florists from St. Georges Chapel and Buckingham Palace.\nWorking with them has been an absolute pleasure, Ms. Craddock said of the royal couple, calling the creative process, highly collaborative, free-flowing, creative and fun.\nThe presence of peonies was no major surprise: Meghan has previously said on social media that peonies make her endlessly happy. White roses meanwhile, were a favorite flower of Princess Diana.\n47\nWhat about the real party?\nThat came later Saturday night at Frogmore House. It was hosted by Prince Charles.\n48\nWhat about music at the wedding? And was there a band or a D.J. at the party?\nAccording to a statement from Kensington Palace on April 24: ""Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have taken a great deal of interest and care in choosing the music"" for their wedding ceremony.\nThere were well-known hymns and choral works performed by the St. George\'s Chapel choir and an orchestra, plus performances by the opera soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, trumpeter David Blackadder and rising star cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 19, who is the first black winner of the prestigious BBC Young Musician of the Year award.\nA Christian gospel group, the Kingdom Choir, was also at the ceremony and sang a rousing version of Stand by Me.\nThe nighttime reception at Frogmore House was private, but the Daily Mail reports that Elton John sang four tunes and there was indeed a DJ by the name of Sam Totolee who played house music.\nJohn Stillwell/Getty Images\n\n49\nWho pays for royal weddings, anyway?\nThe Royal Family pays for the wedding itself  the service, the flowers, the music and the reception. The bride typically pays for her dress. The British public pays for security.\n50\nHow much do royal weddings cost?\nIf you have to ask, you cant afford one.\n51\nFair enough. How much did William and Kates wedding cost?\nIt reportedly cost $34 million, of which\nwent to security  and was paid for by the British taxpayers. This amount is equal to:\n52\nWhat sort of things did Meghan do in preparation for marrying into the royal family?\nIn addition to the regular stuff  making official public appearances at various events; making small talk with people in crowds; dressing more conservatively and accessorizing her outfits with the kind of hats that young female royals seem required to wear in a way that is not ironic  Meghan opted to (or had to) convert to Anglicanism, the official religion in England, before marrying Harry.\n53\nWhat religion did she convert from?\nMeghan was already a Protestant, so it was not a huge stretch.\n54\nWill she become a British citizen?\nYes. And shell have to take a torturous citizenship test to do it.\n55\nIs Meghan giving up her career as an actress?\nYes. But, she says, I dont see it as giving anything up. I just see it as a change. Its a new chapter, saying to Harry Now its time to work as a team with you.\n56\nWhat will she do? What do royals actually do day-to-day?\nIn many ways, young royals are just like us: they drive cars, go to supermarkets, drop kids off at school and work out at the gym. But while some have day jobs  Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, for instance  its unlikely that Meghan will take on a 9-to-5 job after her marriage. There will be numerous public engagements to attend (exactly what kind will be clearer once she has outlined the causes and charities she plans to support), and you can expect a royal tour abroad with her new husband in the first year or two. Got to keep the fans happy, after all.\n57\nWhat are some other ways Meghans life will change post-wedding?\nFor one, shell have to get used to sitting in royal ranking order. At events attended by a large number of royal persons, members must enter in reverse order of whos next in line to the throne, from most junior to most senior, with the queen last of all. Partners stay together, so Meghan and Harry will enter first, followed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (William and Kate), the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall (Prince Charles and Camilla), and lastly Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip). Her Majesty will then be seated in the middle, with the family ordered around her.\nAlso, royals are not meant to make their political views public, at least on certain issues; dont vote; and cant run for office. So Meghan, long outspoken on many social issues, will have to be careful with how she uses her new platform.\n58\nIs it true that Harry and Meghan are distant cousins?\n59\nWhat are some reliable sources of information on this wedding? Besides this F.A.Q., of course.\n60\nWas there an official photographer?\nThere was! And his name is Alexi Lubomirski. You can see the official royal wedding photos here.\nBorn in England and raised in Botswana, Mr. Lubomirski took the couples official engagement portrait last year and is known for his glossy shots in magazines like Elle and Vogue. He also, incidentally, happens to be a dashing European prince. Between commissions, His Serene Highness Alexi Lubomirski of Poland found time to pen a book: Princely Advice for a Happy Life, published in 2015.\n61\nWas May 19 a public holiday in the U.K.?\nNo. There was a public holiday to celebrate the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, but William is the future king. Harry is not. One special exception was made for the party-loving royals big day, though: The government announced that pubs, bars and other licensed premises can keep serving alcohol until 1 a.m., instead of the usual 11 p.m., on the nights of May 18 and May 19.\n62\nWhat about the honeymoon?\nWe may never know.\nBut rumors abound: Namibia was Travel and Leisures guess, while TMZ reported that the couple would stay in the private Outlook Cabin at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge in Alberta, Canada. (The resorts website refers to the 6,000-square-foot cabin as The Royal Retreat because it has hosted members of the British royal family in the past; Harrys grandmother Queen Elizabeth stayed there with Prince Philip in 2005. You can take a virtual tour of the six-bedroom premiseshere.)\nThere was also internet chatter about Ireland and Ashford Castle.\nOne place seemingly never on the list: Thailand. Too bad because ina 2013 video for the beauty subscription service Birchbox, Meghan stated that a meal she once had atChote Chitr in Bangkok (ranked No. 6,832 of 10,542 restaurants in Bangkok on TripAdvisor as of this writing) was probably the best meal I ever had in my life.\n63\nWhat do I get the royal who has everything?\nGet them the one thing they dont have: nothing. In lieu of gifts, Meghan and Harry have asked those well-wishers eager to spend money on them to donate to charities. The couple have nominated seven organizations reflecting their shared values. On the royal familys official website, guests and nonguests alike can find links to donate directly to the organizations. (In the lead-up to their wedding, William and Kate asked would-be gift givers to contribute to a general fund for 26 charities.)\nHeres Meghan and Harrys list:\nCHIVA (Children\'s H.I.V. Association): An organization that supports children and young people living with H.I.V. in U.K. and Ireland. Harry hosted members of CHIVAs youth committee at Kensington Palace in October of 2016.\nCrisis: The U.K.s national charity for homeless people. In January, Meghan and Harrys nuptials became a source of local controversy when a politician in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (the site of their wedding venue) called on police to take immediate action against homeless people living in the vicinity, in preparation for the May event. Crisis responded via written statement on April 1 criticizing the criminalising of people simply because they are homeless. On April 8, the couple named the charity to their list of recommended donation recipients.\nMyna Mahila Foundation: A health organization that aims to destigmatize menstruation, promote menstrual hygiene, and increase access to menstruation pads in India. Meghan visited the foundation headquarters in January of 2017; her experience there featured prominently in an op-ed about global perceptions of menstruation that she wrote for Time.com in March of that year.\nScotty\'s Little Soldiers: A military charity that offers support to children and young people whose parents died while serving in the British armed forces. In May of 2017, Harry hosted children from the organization at a garden party at Buckingham Palace, where he spun plates.\nStreetGames: A network of neighborhood sports projects that aims to bring organized sports to underserved communities. On the couples first official visit to Wales, Harry encouraged young StreetGames participants to ambush Meghan in what her fleeting look of panic suggested was an impromptu group hug.\nSurfers Against Sewage: A marine conservation charity in Cornwall, where Harry has been known to surf. Cowabunga, mate.\nThe Wilderness Foundation U.K.: A wildlife conservation charity with an emphasis on exposing young people to the outdoors. In September 2017, Harry traveled to Essex to observe an environmental education program run by the foundation, where he saw a woman throw water at a child (with the childs permission).\n64\nWho was Harrys best man?\nWilliam. Harry was Williams best man. No ones best man: the actress Priyanka Chopra, who has publicly declared she is not Meghans maid of honor, although they are friends.\n65\nDo royals have wedding rehearsals?\nWilliam and Kate had multiple ones, right up until the night before their wedding.\n66\nWill any corgis be in attendance?  Joan Toth, United States\nAlmost certainly not. William and Kate didnt have corgis at their wedding, nor did Charles at either of his. Even the corgi zealot Queen Elizabeths nuptials were dog-free, though Vanity Fair reported in a 2015 royal dog deep dive that one tagged along for her honeymoon.\nThis could be a heartbreaking situation for the corgis who, to hear Harry and Meghan tell it, would love to marry Meghan themselves. (See Question 23.)\nAnd there is the simple fact that there just arent that many of them in the royal household anymore: The Daily Mail reported that the queens last ""royal"" corgi (descended from a corgi owned by her father), Willow, died on April 15th, 2018 at age 14. The monarch still has two dachshund-corgi mixes (dorgis named Vulcan and Candy), and one corgi (Whisper) she adopted after the death of its owner.\nAnd anyway, how many dogs is your grandmother allowed to bring to your wedding?\n67\nIs there any chance of Meghan Markle getting back on social media?  Ankit Bera\nIts unlikely that Meghan will reactivate her old social media accounts in the near future. Currently, neither the queen nor members of Prince Charless immediate family publicly maintain individual accounts. Charles and Camillas official comings and goings are tracked by @ClarenceHouse on Twitter and Instagram. William, Kate and Harry are represented in the same spaces by @KensingtonRoyal, which has been incorporating Palace-sanctioned Meghan news into its feeds since the engagement was announced. (Unlike those three, Meghan does not appear in the @KensingtonRoyal avatars or descriptions on either platform, but perhaps that will change once the marriage is official.) The queen, Prince Philip and other members of the royal family are covered under @RoyalFamily on Twitter and @TheRoyalFamily on Instagram.\nIf youd told King Henry VIII that one day the sixth in line to the British throne would be marrying a star of USA Networks Suits, he probably would have had questions: Does this mean England and Scotland have been united into a single state? What does USA stand for? How are you using star in that sentence? But he certainly would not have asked about her public social media profiles. All of which is to say, anything is possible.\nPrior to publicly announcing her and Harrys relationship, Meghan was an enthusiastic user of social media, and The Daily Mail reported that he followed her on Instagram under a pseudonymous private account. (Though she deleted her Instagram in January of 2018, traces of it exist online as photos hosted on other sites. Her Twitter account half-lives in the form of cached page screenshots.) Its possible that the royal familys social media strategy will eventually shift from staid collective representation to more personalized individual coverage. Some extended members of the family already maintain their own accounts; Harrys aunt Sarah Fergusons Twitter feed (@SarahTheDuchess, not @Fergie) makes robust use of hashtags.\nIn the meantime, if youd like to be directly responsible for Meghans social media presence, you might apply for a job in the royal households communications department. It recently sought an assistant able to think on your feet to begin work one month before Harry and Meghans wedding, at a starting salary of about $30,000.\n68\nWill Miss Meghan Markle be changing her dress for Prince Charles\'s late-night reception? If so, which designers are being considered for this dress?  Rafeal Briatico, Canada\nShe sure did. The Duchess of Sussex stepped out for her evening reception in a backless halter dress by Stella McCartney.\n69\nOn May 19, I will be arriving at Heathrow on a British Airways flight from the States at approximately 12:30 p.m. Will I be able to watch the wedding on the plane?  Catherine K. Kuhlman, United States\nWhile some American airline companies now offer Wi-Fi on select transatlantic routes, British Airways has yet to jump on that bandwagon. So you may miss out on the first hourish of the wedding, unless you catch a favorable tailwind. (And, besides, the onboard reception can be seriously patchy at the best of times.) But fear not: There are sure to be endless televised reruns of key moments in the hours and weeks following the big day.\n70\nIs the L.G.B.T.Q. community represented in the royal family?  Debbie Lemieux\nAlthough rumors about the sexuality of certain British royal family members have circulated for centuries, the first of the lot to officially come out as gay was the queen\'s cousin, Ivor Mountbatten, in 2016. The royal family has also made efforts in recent years to show that Britains L.G.B.T.Q. community is not only accepted but supported by the monarchy. In 2016, Prince William became the first member of the royal family to appear on the cover of a gay magazine when he graced the pages of Attitude. And last year, in the Queens Speech, Her Majesty explicitly made reference to the community, saying, My government will make further progress to tackle the gender pay gap and discrimination against people on the basis of their race, faith, gender, disability or sexual orientation.\n71\nNot clear, but will Meghan have an H.R.H. before her name?  Richard Klein, United States\nYes. Once Harry and Meghan tie the knot, she will take his title (see Question 35) and his last name (Question 36), which is followed by an H.R.H. In her case, that stands for Her Royal Highness.\n72\nWill Meghan wear anything from Princess Diana?  Simone, Denmark\nAs explained in Question 21, Meghans engagement ring features a large central diamond flanked by two smaller stones that belonged to Princess Diana.\n73\nWhat is going to happen with Rachel Zane in Suits?  Carlos\nShe married Mike Ross in a two-hour season finale on April 25, and shes never coming back.\n74\nAre there particular colors that will be used at the reception?  Barbara Bunce, United States\nUnlike the wedding ceremony, the receptions (one thrown by the queen, the other by Prince Charles) will not be televised, leaving the public to conjecture about the colors and shades of various items present.\nWilliam and Kates ceremony was pretty much white, and white, and white all over (though the groom wore a red tunic in the military dress of an Irish Guards officer). The most prominent splashes of color were the red, white and blue ribbons and bows bedecking the Aston Martin the couple drove to Prince Charless home following their official reception. The cars back bumper was festooned with charmingly cheesy C and W balloons (for Catherine and William) in the striking color palette of black, magenta, orange, lime and sky blue. The vehicle was reportedly decorated by Prince Harry.\nChris Radburn/Getty Images\n\n75\nWill there be tea??  Anne Armstrong, United States\n76\nWill Meghan wear any of the crowns owned or worn by the late Princess Diana?\nAnwar Hussein/Getty Images\nAlmost certainly. The Duchess of Cambridge often wears crowns and tiaras owned by her late mother-in-law, including the Cambridge Lover\'s Knot tiara, given to Princess Diana as a wedding gift from the queen. Once Meghan is married, it is highly likely that she too will receive access to the royal collection of jewels.\n77\nHow tall is Harry?  Robert Littman, United States\nHe is 6-foot-1, or 1.86 meters tall. (William is a little over 6-foot-2, or 1.91 meters.)\n78\nWhat if Prince Philip (or any important royal) dies between now and the wedding?  Patty DeVille, United States\nWell, luckily neither he nor any other royal did. But, if someone had: it is unlikely that there would be a state funeral or that a royal wedding would be postponed unless the queen or an heir to the throne (see the order of succession in Question 24) died; far too much work and planning goes into those event. That said, any royals passing would be mourned by the nation, and likely marked with the Union flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace. The queens death would be a different matter: The Guardian published a fascinating article last year about Operation London Bridge  the official plan in place for her passing.\n79\nWill their children be No. 7, No. 8, etc. in line for the throne?  Marcia Krause Bilyk, United States\nYes. Any children born to Prince Harry will bump his uncle Andrew  Charless brother, currently seventh in line for the throne, after Harry  further down the order of succession. And thanks to an amendment passed in 2011, elder daughters will not lose their positions to sons born later. (The change is already affecting Williams children; its why Princess Charlotte remains fourth in line to the throne after big brother George and Prince Louis slid in at No. 5.) Bear in mind that any children eventually born to George, Charlotte or Louis will knock Harry (and his kids) even further from the top spot.\n80\nWhere are the answers?  Karen K. Cleaver\nClick on the questions, Karen!\n81\nWas this wedding intended to be fun?\nDepends on what you consider fun, really. The wedding service lasted an hour and wasnt a barrel of laughs. Officially, however, the royal family enjoys fun. A statement about the wedding from a royal secretary said that the crowds that have turned out in Nottingham, Cardiff, Brixton, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Belfast, Bath and elsewhere have given Ms. Markle a welcome to the United Kingdom marked by warmth, enthusiasm and a real sense of fun. Sounds fun!\n82\nHad Meghans mother met the royal family prior to the wedding?\nMeghans mother, Doria Ragland, had met Harry; they were photographed together (with Meghan) at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto. Doria met the rest of the royal family, including the queen, the week of the wedding.\n83\nDid the ceremony include any tributes to Princess Diana?\nYes. Dianas sister Lady Jane Fellowes performed a reading as part of the ceremony.\n84\nWhat was the parking situation in Windsor?\nThere was supposed to be room for 6,000 cars (or motorcycles) in a special car parking area in Windsor, but you drivers had to book their spot in advance. And pay 30! (A little over $40!!!)\n85\nWhat time did the wedding guests arrive?\nThemembers of the public invited inside the grounds of Windsor Castle to quasi-attend the wedding as a thank you for their community service will begin arriving around 9 a.m. They will not enter the chapel. The guests who are really, truly, actually invited will arrive from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m.\n86\nDid the royal family arrive at the same time as the regular guests?\nNo. They started arriving around 11:20 a.m. William and Harry arrived together by foot. Protocol dictates that the queen be the last member of the royal family to arrive, and she was.\n87\nWhen did Meghan get there?\nMeghan and her mom set out from the Cliveden House Hotel (where they stayed the night before) and she arrived right before the ceremony began at noon.\n88\nWhen did the unwashed masses get a glimpse of the married couple?\nPeople worldwide watched them transform from those cool and technically single people, Harry and Meghan into that married couple in real time on TV and online (see Question 9). The crowds gathered in Windsor got a look at the Duke and Duchess as they took a carriage ride through town.\n89\nWhat can you tell me about the fancy carriage they were in?\nHonestly too much. They were planning to ride in an open-topped Ascot Landau that dates back to the Victorian era. The Crown Equerry  thats the British equivalent of  well, the United States doesnt really have one  No. 1 Head Horse Guy, Accept No Substitutes?  describes the carriage as wonderfully bright, small and lovely. Its black with red accents and, moving at top speed, would still be slower than the worst car you ever drove.\nHad it rained, the couple would have taken the Scottish State Coach, which is enclosed by glass windows.\n90\nDoes anyone living in 2018 really need more than one fancy carriage?\nNo, but the royal family owns dozens upon dozens upon dozens. Heres a gilded one that weighs nearly four tons.\n91\nWho pulled the carriage?\nMilford Haven, Sir Basil, Storm and Tyrone.\n92\nWhy is it O.K. with the royal family that Prince Harry is marrying a divorced American when King Edward VIII had to abdicate when he married a divorced American, Wallis Simpson, in 1937?  Jo Anne Dickerson, United States\nIt is true that divorce was once a deal-breaker for royal marriages (leaving aside Henry VIII). Theres no law against it, but as the head of the Church of England, a British monarch is expected to set, and enforce, high moral standards. The allergy to divorce lasted until fairly recently, thwarting the hopes and dreams not just of Edward VIII, but also of Princess Margaret, the queens late sister, who in 1955 was given the unsavory choice of giving up either her royal title and privileges, or the divorced man she loved. (She kept the privileges, gave up the divorced man, married someone else, and ended up divorcing him, anyway.) But no matter how upset Queen Elizabeth might be by divorce, she cant escape the fact that three of her four children  Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne  all divorced their spouses. So this one falls into the ""times have changed, and we have changed with them,"" category.\n93\nWhat about Harrys bachelor party?\nThe details of Harry\'s singledom send-off (called a stag do in Britain) are still unclear, but his elder brother clearly relished the prospect of some ritual humiliation. After being named best man in April (see Question 65), William told the press that revenge is sweet. Harry arranged Williams bachelor party back in 2011, held secretly at a country estate in Norfolk.\n94\nWill there be a prenup?  Mayowa Tomori, Nigeria\nIf there is one, you can be sure they won\'t release the details publicly! That said, neither Prince Charles nor Prince William had prenuptial agreements, and there are no examples of prenuptial agreements elsewhere in the British royal family. Chances are Harry wont stray from that precedent. In fact, instances of royal families signing prenups remain relatively few and far between. One came in 2010, when Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden married her former fitness instructor, Daniel Westling. Lawyers acting for the princess ensured that all property, inheritance and gifts belonging to the royal household remained in her name alone.\n95\nWill Meghan have to renounce her American citizenship after the wedding?  Zackary Angeline, United States\nShe probably wont have to, but she might want to. Shortly after Meghan and Harrys engagement announcement, a spokesman for the royal family confirmed that Meghan intends to become a U.K. citizen (see Question 54), but will retain her U.S. citizenship at least while that yearslong process is underway. At the time, the spokesman declared it too early to say if Meghan would opt to hold onto her American citizenship after the process is complete.\nWhile the United States government officially does not encourage people to obtain dual citizenship (one reason mentioned on the state departments travel website: dual nationality may limit U.S. government efforts to assist nationals abroad), pledging an oath of allegiance to Britain does not automatically invalidate Meghans natural-born American citizenship. To lose that, shed either have to formally declare her intent to relinquish it (which involves some paperwork and a fee) or commit an act of treason against the United States of America (which might not gel with Meghans California-cool vibe). If she gives up her U.S. citizenship and later decides she wants to become a U.S. citizen again, shell have to go through the same application process as people who have never been American citizens.\nSo why might she consider giving it up entirely instead of retaining dual citizenship? For one thing, it would be a dramatic way of showing her new in-laws that shes all in on this England idea. For another: taxes. Americans living abroad remain subject to U.S. tax laws, even if they have dual citizenship. As The Washington Post explained shortly after Harry and Meghans engagement, this technicality risks exposing the royal familys notoriously private financial records to a wide audience in the form of IRS review or (illegal) leaks.\nA more direct parallel for Meghan is the Philadelphia-born actress Grace Kelly, who retained her U.S. citizenship when she became Princess of Monaco.\n96\nWill Meghan and Prince Harrys future children have dual English and American citizenship?  Luna Maduro, The Netherlands\nEnglish citizenship doesnt technically exist; British citizen is the designation applied to individuals from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Even if Meghan and Harrys kids arent born in the United Kingdom, theyll still be British citizens by descent. Assuming Meghan does not renounce her U.S. citizenship, theyll also be U.S. citizens, regardless of where theyre born. They may choose to opt out of either citizenship as adults. (The U.S. government considers renunciation requests from minors as young as 16, but the state department website ominously notes that such requests are afforded very careful consideration. The British government accepts renunciation requests from individuals under 18 only if they are married.)\nPrince Albert II of Monaco, born a dual citizen of Monaco and the U.S. thanks to his American mother, Grace Kelly, renounced his U.S. citizenship at age 21  perhaps in anticipation of his role as Monacos sovereign. (Theres a possibility Harry or Meghans child could one day become head of the British monarchy, but its unlikely. See Question 24 for more on that.)\n97\nCould a child of Harry and Meghan become president of the United States?\nYes, as long as:\n* Meghan does not renounce her U.S. citizenship before he or she is born.\n* The child lives as a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.\n* Legislators maintain the definition of natural born citizen (a term used in Article II of the Constitution, outlining requirements for presidential eligibility) as a person on whom citizenship was automatically conferred at birth, rather than adopting the more narrow definition occasionally proposed of a person who was born on American soil. (Obviously, in the unlikely event the would-be president is born on American soil, this part wont be an issue.)\n98\nDid Sarah Ferguson attend the wedding?\nShe was! While the Duchess of York told Oprah she was not invited to her nephew Williams wedding (she booked a stay at a Thailand resort to avoid being in town during the festivities), Harry is said to be close with the Duchesss daughter Eugenie, who announced her own engagement in January and, in April, moved next door to Harry and Meghan in Kensington Palace with her fianc. Fergusons blanket exclusion from official royal events can be traced to her 1996 divorce from Prince Andrew, but since Harry and Meghans wedding is not a state occasion, they had a little leeway with the guest list.\n99\nWhat were the bobbies wearing in Windsor the day of the wedding?\nThames Valley Police\n100\nWhat were the bobbies be wearing  from behind?\nThames Valley Police\n101\nWhere did the couple stay the night before the wedding?\nThe couple kept things traditional and stayed in separate hotels the night before the wedding. Meghan stayed with her mother at Cliveden House Hotel, roughly nine miles from Windsor and the site of one of the biggest scandals in 20th century British politics. Harry stayed at Coworth Park in Ascot, with brother William on hand to allay any last minute nerves.\n102\nWhats the deal with Meghans dad, Thomas Markle?\nIn the end he did not give Meghan away or attend the wedding. On May 17, Meghan issued a statement saying Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\nHeres a little background on the drama that preceded the May 17 announcement:\nOn May 4, a Kensington Palace news release stated that Meghans divorced father, Thomas, who has yet to meet Prince Harry or any other members of the royal family, would walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding.\nNine days later, on May 13, The Daily Mail published images and footage it identified as originating from closed-circuit security cameras that appeared to show Mr. Markle posing for fake-candid photos of himself for a British paparazzi photographer. The resulting pictures depicted Mr. Markle scrolling through Meghan and Harrys official engagement photos on a desktop computer at an internet cafe, and were part of a series of recently published photos of Mr. Markle purporting to catch him going about his daily life unawares. Kensington Palace did not comment on the photos, or the accusations of staging.\nOn May 14, TMZ reported that Mr. Markle admitted to a TMZ representative that he had staged the photos. TMZ also wrote that Mr. Markle claimed to have suffered a heart attack six days prior, and that he informed the celebrity news agency of his intention to skip Meghan and Harrys wedding.\nKensington Palace appeared to have been surprised by Mr. Markles remarks to TMZ, which were published at 6:35 p.m. London time. Reuters reported that a spokesman responded to initial requests for comment by stating We have got nothing on this at the moment.\nShortly before 9 p.m. local time on May 14, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released the following statement to reporters: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.\nOn Tuesday, May 15, the circumstances surrounding Thomas Markles participation in the wedding became even murkier when TMZ published a new story claiming Mr. Markle had changed his mind about not attending. In an update that might be characterized as frenetic, TMZ reported that Mr. Markle was currently re-hospitalized for chest pains, was asking his doctors to release him by Wednesday, had walked back his own criticism of his collaboration with the paparazzi, had missed a call from Meghan but received a text message expressing her love and concern, and had expressed a renewed desire to walk Meghan down the aisle. TMZ quoted him as saying both I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle, and Of course Id walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. Id like to be a part of history.\nAs for how his daughters future in-laws might be responding to his recent behavior, Mr. Markle reportedly said, I don\'t think the Queen is thinking about what I\'m doing. Ha.\n103\nSo who walked Meghan down the aisle?\nPrince Charles!\nMs. Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St. Georges Chapel on her wedding day, read a statement from Kensington Palace the day before the event.\nThere had been speculation that Meghans mother Doria would walk her down the aisle. Doria wdidill, however, accompany her daughter from the Cliveden House Hotel (where she and Meghan stayed on Friday night) to St. Georges Chapel on the wedding day.\n104\nBy the way, what else happened on May 19?\nThe F.A. Cup final, the most important soccer match of the year in Britain. Its like holding the Academy Awards at the same time as the Super Bowl. #awkward\nEdited by Anya Strzemien and Bonnie Wertheim.

"Members of the U.S. military install multiple tiers of concertina wire along the banks of the Rio Grande near the Juarez-Lincoln Bridge at the U.S.-Mexico border, Nov. 16, 2018, in Laredo, Texas.",0,1,4,6.54107141494751,"[{'title': 'Migrants flee more countries, regardless of US policies', 'date': '2022-12-22T15:56:24', 'content': 'TIJUANA, Mexico (AP)  In 2014, groups of unaccompanied children escaping violence in Central America overwhelmed U.S. border authorities in South Texas. In 2016, thousands of Haitians fled a devastating earthquake and stopped in Tijuana, Mexico, after walking and taking buses through up to 11 countries to the U.S. border.\nIn 2018, about 6,000 mostly Guatemalan and Honduran migrants fleeing violence and poverty descended on Tijuana, many of them families with young children sleeping in frigid, rain-soaked parks and streets.\nA Trump-era ban on asylum, granted a brief extension by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday, was one of the U.S. policies affecting migrants decisions to leave their homes. The last eight years show how an extraordinary convergence of inequality, civil strife and natural disasters also have been prompting millions to leave Latin America, Europe and Africa. Since 2017, the United States has been the worlds top destination for asylum-seekers, according to the United Nations.\n___\nThis is part of an occasional series on how the United States became the worlds top destination for asylum-seekers.\n___\nMigrants have been denied the right to seek asylum under U.S. and international law 2.5 million times since March 2020 on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19, an authority known as Title 42. It applies to all nationalities but has fallen disproportionately on people from countries that Mexico takes back, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and, more recently Venezuela, as well as Mexico. Pent-up demand is expected to drive crossings higher when asylum restrictions end.\nWhen the pandemic hit, nationalities rarely seen at the border grew month after month, from Cuba, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia. High costs, strained diplomatic relations and other considerations complicated U.S. efforts to expel people from countries that Mexico wouldnt take.\nCubans are fleeing their homes in the largest numbers in six decades to escape economic and political turmoil. Most fly to Nicaragua as tourists and slowly make their way to the U.S. They were the second-largest nationality at the border after Mexicans in October.\nGrissell Matos Prieguez and her husband surrendered to border agents near Eagle, Pass, Texas, Oct. 30, after a 16-day journey through six countries that included buses, motorcycles and taxis and exhausting night walks through bushes and foul-smelling rivers.\nThroughout all the journey you feel like you are going to die, you dont trust anybody, nothing, said Matos, a 34-year-old engineer. You live in a constant fear, or to be detained and that anything would happen.\nTo pay for the trip from Santiago de Cuba, they sold everything, down to computers and bicycles, and borrowed from relatives in Florida. Their parents and grandparents stayed behind.\nA recent surge that has made El Paso, Texas, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings is made up largely of Nicaraguans, whose government has quashed dissent.\nHaitians who stop in South America, sometimes for years, have been a major presence, most notably when nearly 16,000 camped in the small town of Del Rio, Texas, in September 2021. The Biden administration flew many home but slowed returns amid increasingly brazen attacks by gangs that have grown more powerful since the assassination of President Jovenel Mose last year.\nMigration is often driven by pull factors that draw people to a country, such as a relatively strong U.S. economy and an asylum system that takes years to decide a case, encouraging some to come even if they feel unlikely to win. But conditions at home, known as push factors, may be as responsible for unprecedented numbers over the last year.\nLooking back, Tijuana attorney and migrant advocate Soraya Vazquez says the Haitian diaspora of 2016 was a turning point.\nWe began to realize that there were massive movements all over, in some places from war, in others from political situations, violence, climate change, said Vazquez, a San Diego native and former legislative aide in Mexico City. Many things happened at once but, in the end, men and our governments are responsible.\nAfter hosting legal workshops for Haitians in Tijuana, Vazquez helped bring chef Jose Andres World Central Kitchen to the citys migrant shelters for four years. Seeking financial stability, she became Tijuana director of Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit group that reported $4.1 million in revenue in 2020 and was recently named a beneficiary of MacKenzie Scotts philanthropy.\nWhat provoked all of this? Inequality, Vazquez said over tea in Tijuanas trendy Cacho neighborhood.\nFor decades, Mexicans, largely adult men, went to the U.S. to fill jobs and send money home. But in 2015, the Pew Research Center found more Mexicans returned to Mexico from the U.S. than came since the Great Recession ended.\nMexicans still made up one of three encounters with U.S. border agents during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, higher than three years ago but well below the 85% reported in 2011 and the 95% at the turn of the century. And those fleeing are increasingly families trying to escape drug-fueled violence with young children.\nLike clockwork, hundreds cross the border after midnight in Yuma, Arizona, walking through Mexican shrub to surrender to U.S. agents. Many fly to the nearby city of Mexicali after entering Mexico as tourists and take a taxi to the desert. The Border Patrol releases them to the Regional Center for Border Health, a clinic that charters six buses daily to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.\nThe health clinic had shuttled families from more than 140 countries by August, not one from Mexico, said Amanda Aguirre, its executive director.\nDaniel Paz, a Peruvian who surrendered to border agents in Yuma with his wife and 10-year-old in August, had the surprise misfortune of being expelled home without a chance at asylum, unusual even after the Peruvian government began accepting two U.S. charter flights a week.\nPeruvians were stopped more than 9,000 times by U.S. authorities along the Mexican border in October, roughly nine times the same period a year earlier and up from only 12 times the year before.\nPaz is watching developments around Title 42 and considering another attempt after the government of Peruvian President Pedro Castillo was toppled Dec. 7.\nWell see if Im back in January or February, he texted Sunday from Lima. There is no lack of desire.\nTijuanas latest newcomers are Venezuelans, about 300 of whom recently temporarily occupied a city-owned recreational center.\nAbout 7 million Venezuelans fled since 2014, including nearly 2 million to neighboring Colombia, but only recently started coming to the United States.\nMany Venezuelans gather at Mexicos asylum office that opened in Tijuana in 2019 and processed more than 3,000 applications in each of the last two years from dozens of countries, led by Haitians and Hondurans.\nJordy Castillo, 40, said hed wanted to leave Venezuela for 15 years but didnt act until friends and family started reaching the United States last year. His three brothers were first in his circle to seek asylum there, even though they knew no one.\nThey found someone who took them in and got settled, he said.\n__\nAssociated Press writer Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed.', 'description': 'A Trump-era ban on asylum that was granted a brief extension by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday was one of the U.S. policies affecting migrants decisions to leave their homes.', 'source_domain': 'apnews.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'U'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'S'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '.'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Rio'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Grande'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Ju'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##are'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##z'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '-'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Lincoln'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Bridge'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'U'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'S'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '.'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Mexico'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'La'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##redo'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Texas'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['apnews.com'], 'dates': ['2022-12-22T15:56:24'], 'languages': ['']}",1
Manchester City's shirt logo provided a perfect backdrop for Liam Gallagher in July 1994,0,1,4,7.228203773498535,"[{'title': 'Britpop: Photographer Kevin Cummins revisits the 90s', 'date': '2020-09-24T23:11:27', 'content': 'Twenty-five years since Blur and Oasis battled for chart supremacy, renowned music photographer Kevin Cummins has put the heady days of Britpop centre stage in a new book. The Manchester-born snapper recalls fights, flags and the scene\'s fall from grace.\nAs jobs go, it is a tough one - photographing a band when only one member has made it to the shoot.\nDispatched to Amsterdam to picture the then up-and-coming Oasis in 1994, Cummins was greeted by a lone Gallagher brother.\nExpecting to be told singer Liam, guitarist Bonehead and drummer Tony McCarroll were indulging in the Dutch city\'s famous party scene, songwriter Noel gave an altogether blunter response: ""They\'ve been deported.""\n""They\'d had a scrap on the ferry overnight,"" Cummins remembers. ""Noel had gone to bed, the rest of them had a fight with some football fans and were kept on the boat and sent back to England.\n""So that was my introduction to them. I had to drag Noel out and photograph him by the poster for the gig they were supposed to be playing to prove I\'d actually turned up and get paid for it.\n""It never really changed. I once flew to LA to do a piece with them for [music magazine] NME when they were playing somewhere in Hollywood. Within 10 minutes they\'d had two fights on stage then Liam claimed he\'d lost his voice and that was the end of it.\n""There was always a bit of tension [between Noel and Liam]. If you\'ve got a brother you know what it can be like. You kind of know because of your own family not to get involved in other people\'s squabbles.""\nOasis would go on to become one of the biggest bands of the decade - figureheads of the resurgence of UK guitar groups with a catalogue of anthemic hits and record-breaking concerts.\nTheir rise to stardom - and that of contemporaries Blur, Suede and Pulp - provided a soundtrack to a changing of the guard in the pop charts.\nCummins, whose camera work had been gracing the covers and inside pages of the NME since the late 1970s, has chronicled the story in the newly released While We Were Getting High: Britpop and the 90s.\nTaking its title from a line in the Oasis track Champagne Supernova, it has seen him narrow down 25,000 frames on negatives and transparencies to a few hundred with an array of images that would no doubt have adorned the bedroom walls of many music-loving teenagers.\nA corduroy-clad Jarvis Cocker, cigarette-smoking Justine Frischmann and Damon Albarn sitting astride a Lambretta scooter are all featured.\nThe book also includes contributions from the aforementioned Noel as well as Suede frontman Brett Anderson, Echobelly\'s Sonya Aurora Madan and Martin Rossiter of Gene.\nReflecting on that time, a quarter of a century on, Gallagher tells Cummins his band were responsible for pushing indie into the mainstream and that he found the Britpop tag ""a bit demeaning"".\n""Oasis weren\'t part of any scene,"" he says. ""Blur and Suede had their foot in the door long before what came to be known as Britpop was even a thing.\n""We literally smashed it wide open. The NME had to invent a collective so every other [band] could ride on our coattails.""\nIts beginnings were not immediately obvious though, says Cummins, who ironically relocated to London in 1987 just before all eyes turned to his home city as Happy Mondays and The Stone Roses led the ""Madchester"" craze.\nThe 66-year-old says his Britpop pictures were aided by bands who ""understood the value of a good front cover"".\n""The early gestation of a music scene is apparent when you look back, but at the time you\'re not sure where it\'s going. It was certainly a lot calmer photographing Lush and co after spending about two years on the road with the Mondays.\n""With Oasis, I watched them try to kick lumps out of each other and then they\'d get back into position and we\'d do the photos so it was a bit unusual.\n""Blur just enjoyed themselves. They\'d always do what I needed them to do.\n""Similarly with Suede, actually. I went to the [United] States with them a couple of times and they were prepared to do things to make a good photograph. They\'d grown up looking at the NME and they wanted to work at it to make sure what they were giving you were really great pictures.\n""On tour, if the mood isn\'t right I sit back and wait. I don\'t feel I\'ve got to be taking pictures all the time and I don\'t think I\'ve got to be telling them jokes. There\'s always a level of trust.""\nSuede\'s debut album topped the charts in early 1993, but it would be the following year when the excitement and hype around Britpop began to soar with the arrival of Blur\'s Parklife and Oasis\' debut album Definitely Maybe.\nWhen, in August 1995, the NME\'s front cover billed an upcoming singles battle between the latter two groups as a British Heavyweight Championship fight, the wider media immediately took notice.\nOn BBC One\'s Six O\'Clock News, presenter John Humphrys described it as the ""biggest chart war in 30 years"", adding ""the music industry hasn\'t seen anything like it since The Beatles fought it out with The Rolling Stones in the 60s"".\nAs interest peaked over the next 12 months following the release of (What\'s the Story) Morning Glory?, Oasis found themselves playing Wonderwall and Don\'t Look Back in Anger to a quarter of a million adoring fans across two nights at Knebworth in Hertfordshire.\nTabloids and ""lads\' mags"" such as Loaded and FHM, which focused on booze and ""birds"", had also latched on to the phenomenon with many in the media and even the government talking up ""Cool Britannia"" and the rebirth of British pop culture. The union flag became a celebratory backdrop on magazine covers.\nSo wide was Britpop\'s cultural impact, Prime Minister Tony Blair invited Noel Gallagher to Downing Street as part of a celebration of creative industries shortly after taking up residence in Downing Street in 1997.\nThose associations were problematic for some musicians, though, as Anderson tells Cummins in the book.\n""My view of the era is complex,"" the singer says. ""When we started writing those songs in 1991 it felt thrilling and against the grain but [it] soon became a jingoistic, beery cartoon when the money moved in.\n""I think it\'s aged terribly.

"President Trump on Thursday visited the southern border in McAllen, Tex.",0,1,4,6.410258531570435,"[{'title': 'Melania Trump makes unannounced visit to Texas border amid crisis over separated families', 'date': '2018-06-21T19:52:00', 'content': 'First lady Melania Trump arrived in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday in an unannounced trip to the border area amid the administration\'s crisis over the separation of families.\nBefore embarking on a tour of Upbring New Hope Children\'s Shelter, which currently houses about 60 migrant children, most of them teenagers, Mrs. Trump thanked the staff and participated in a question-and-answer session with shelter workers while sitting in front of walls papered with colorful children\'s art.\n""I\'m here to learn about the facility to which I know you housed children on a long-term basis,"" she told the group. ""And I also like to ask you how I can help these children reunite with their families as quickly as possible.""\nThe first lady\'s visit offered a distinctly different set of visuals on a crisis that has so far been illustrated by the sights and sounds of children housed in what look like cages and wailing for their parents. The facility Mrs. Trump chose to visit is a small, permanent shelter that opened in 2014 and typically houses children who cross the border without a parent, a group of migrants known as unaccompanied alien children.\nAccording to a senior administration official, six of the 60 children from Honduras and El Salvador housed at that shelter were separated from their parents.\nThe first lady questioned the nonprofit shelter staff over the family status of the children and how frequently they can talk to their parents  twice a week, a staffer told her, once the child\'s parents are confirmed to actually be their parents.\nMrs. Trump had also planned to try and visit a customs and border patrol processing center, but had to cancel because of flooding in the area. A statement from the first lady\'s office said she wanted to ""hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families.""\nA spokesperson told reporters the trip was planned before President Donald Trump ended the policy; the trip was ""100 percent her idea  she absolutely wanted to come.""\nHer two-hour visit came as the Trump administration has tried to spin the family separation crisis in their favor. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new ""zero tolerance"" policy in April that directs authorities to prosecute all instances of illegal border crossings, resulting in thousands of children being separated from their parents or legal guardians in a six-week period. The Trump administration at first maintained that the increasing number of children being separated from their mothers at the U.S. southern border was not a policy of its own making but just a tragic byproduct of enforcing the law against illegal border crossings.\nAmid growing backlash and media reports of the facilities in which the children were being held, the president sought repeatedly to blame ""bad legislation passed by Democrats"" for his policy while claiming Congress alone could fix it.\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed first that there was no family separation policy, then in a White House press briefing Monday blamed Congress for it and argued that family separation was simply a continuation of previous administrations\' policies. That\'s false the Obama administration usually detained children and parents together  but it\'s a defense Trump himself seized on in recent days after being confronted by increasingly angry members of his own party who spoke out against the policy.\nOn Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order halting his administration\'s family separation practice, but did not address where newly arriving families would stay or how the 2,300 children already separated will be reunited with their parents.\n""Our first lady is down now at the border, because it really bothered her to be looking at this and seeing this, as it bothered me,"" Trump said on Thursday at a Cabinet meeting, before complaining that the crisis was the fault of Democratic lawmakers who ""don\'t care about the children.""\nThe president cited his wife and daughter on Wednesday when signing the executive order on the matter.\n""Ivanka feels very strongly. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it. We don\'t like to see families separated. At the same time, we don\'t want people coming into our country illegally. This takes care of the problem,"" he said. He did not mention that an executive order wasn\'t needed to end the practice, as the Department of Justice had begun implementing the policy without one.\nMrs. Trump waded into the controversy on Sunday, releasing a rare statement hours before Laura Bush and the other living former first ladies  Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama  weighed in on the issue, too.\n""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,"" according to a statement from her spokeswoman. ""She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.""\nThe president said Thursday he would direct agencies to reunite families who had been separated under his administration\'s practice, though the timeline for that is still unclear. The executive order issued Wednesday suggested the government intends to detain whole families together in the future.\nHouse Republicans have been working on two bills meant to address the immigration issues Trump has said need fixing. On Thursday, members voted down a conservative immigration bill, and GOP leaders postponed the vote on a compromise measure originally scheduled for later in the day.\nMembers rejected legislation authored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and favored by conservatives that would have authorized  but not appropriated  government funding for a border wall. It also would not have provided a pathway to citizenship for those eligible under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\nThe vote on the compromise measure had been slated for early Thursday evening, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that vote had been postponed until Friday to give members more time to review the legislation.', 'description': 'Her visit comes as the Trump administration tries to spin the end of the family separation policy  which his administration created  in their favor.', 'source_domain': 'www.nbcnews.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-PER', 'word': 'Trump'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'M'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##c'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##llen'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Tex'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.nbcnews.com'], 'dates': ['2018-06-21T19:52:00'], 'languages': ['']}",1

But the photos from the City of Lights early Wednesday were nothing short of magical.\nAs much as six inches of snow fell on Paris late Tuesday, coating Montmartre, Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower in a pristine layer of white. It was the largest snow accumulation in the French capital since 1987, according to Meteo France, and it brought the city to a halt Wednesday morning, the news website thelocal.fr reported:\nDrivers were told to leave their cars at home, while rail chiefs urged passengers not to travel.

Visitors dressed in costumes take a selfie at Hong Kong's Disneyland after the theme park officially reopened after nearly five months.,0,1,4,6.2378551959991455,"[{'title': 'Different Disneylands around the world', 'date': '2012-12-18T00:00:00', 'content': ""Disney may have started in the US, but its international theme parks have been infused with locally familiar elements, from feng shui in Hong Kong to European inventors in Paris.\nDisneyland calls itself the happiest place in the world, but to keep visitors happy in its five locations across the globe, each theme park is tweaked to cater to local cultures and tastes. Outside of the two original resort areas in the United States, Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in Florida, the Disneylands in Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong offer subtly different selections of food, rides and layout to make the millions of visitors each year feel at home.\nTokyo Disneyland\nOpened in 1983 and larger than the original Disneyland California, Tokyo Disneyland is the third most visited of any theme park in the world after the two Disney parks in the US. Like Walt Disney World in Florida, Cinderellas Castle is located at the centre of the park, rumoured to have been chosen because the princesss qualities of duty and a strong work ethic would resonate more deeply in Japanese culture than Sleeping Beauty, whose castle is featured in the centre of Disneyland California.\nBut like karaoke, which originated in Japan and is a country-wide obsession, Disneyland gives the often-reserved Japanese people a place to unleash their rowdy side. In Tokyo Disneyland, even adult visitors will sing, clap and dance along to the internationally themed live shows, such as the Latin-American vibes of Minnie Oh! Minnie or the street show Jubilation!; it is a level of audience participation that would be a rare sight in the US.\nSimilarly, the food offered at Tokyo Disneyland is noticeably different from the US, infusing both Chinese and American flavours with Japanese cuisine. To refuel between rides or while waiting in the lengthy queues, you can buy a steamed bun -- originally a traditional Chinese delicacy with hot, sweet or savoury fillings -- from Boiler Room Bites in Adventureland. The usually round bun is in the shape of Mickey Mouses head, with the iconic mouse ears filled with teriyaki chicken. The donburi, a traditional Japanese dish that consists of rice and savoury toppings, can be ordered with US flavours like taco meat (spiced minced pork), creole chicken or shrimp patties instead of teriyaki meats. This is then topped with cabbage and an egg, just like you would find in any donburi eatery in Japan.\nIf you are still feeling peckish, try some popcorn with local flavours, such as soy sauce with butter from the popcorn stands next to the ImageWorks photo studio in Tomorrowland or Caf Orlans in Adventureland, or Japanese curry from the stand next to the Trading Post gift shop in Westernland. For milk tea-flavoured popcorn, a popular sweet, South-East Asian fusion of tea and milkshake that also goes by the name of bubble tea, you will have to head to the nearby Tokyo DisneySea, a separate park with water slides and watery rides.\nHong Kong Disneyland\nThe small Hong Kong Disneyland, opened in 2005, incorporates feng shui and traditional Chinese elements into its design to attract tourists from mainland China.\nFeng shui balances the elements of wood, fire, earth, metal and water to create positive energy, and these elements can be seen throughout the theme park. Rocks represent stability and prevent good luck from flowing away, so two gigantic boulders have been placed at the parks entrance to stop energy from flowing out of the resort. Water stimulates fortune and wealth, and the park is full of lakes, ponds and streams -- not to mention the large fountain featuring Disney characters placed at the main entrance of the park.\nThe main gate of the theme park has been positioned in a northsouth direction for good fortune, and as you approach the entrance, look out for a sharp bend in the walkway. This was put in intentionally to stop good qi (energy) flowing into the nearby South China Sea.\nChinese culture is filled with superstitions about numbers, with 888 considered to be a powerful number of wealth. That is why the Beijing Olympics were staged on 8 August 2008, the eighth day of the eighth month of an eighth year. Similarly, the main ballroom at the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel is exactly 888sqm. There are 2,238 crystal lotuses adorning the hotels Crystal Lotus Chinese restaurant because in Cantonese the number sounds like the phrase to easily generate wealth. The obsession continues with the number four, which is unlucky to the Chinese because it sounds like the word death in both Mandarin and Cantonese. So you may notice that the elevators in Hong Kongs Disneyland have no number four, because the floors in all of the buildings skip from three to five.\nOther items that are missing are clocks in the gift shops (so no Mickey watches!), because in Cantonese and Mandarin giving a clock sounds like going to a funeral. Green hats are not available to buy (sorry Peter Pan!) because of a Chinese expression that a man wearing a green hat is cheating on his wife (the relatives of prostitutes were forced to wear green hats in ancient China). What you will see is a lot of is red, a lucky colour according to Chinese culture. Look for liberal uses of painted accents on the buildings on Main Street, USA.\nWhen you are done counting, have a dim sum lunch, something Hong Kong is famous for. If you want to try dumplings with a Disneyland flavour, go to the Crystal Lotus restaurant where the dumplings and steamed buns are formed in the shapes of characters from Disney films, such as Duffy the Disney Bear (a character that exists only as a product, but who is very popular in the Asian market), Chicken Little of the eponymous 2005 film, the three-eyed Little Green Men from the Toy Story movies, and of course those mouse ears in the form of Mickey fried shrimp and root vegetables, Mickey seafood glutinous pancakes, Mickey red bean honey pudding and Mickey green tea jelly.\nThere is also ample opportunity to take a picture with Mulan, the animated character from Ancient China, whose actor can be found posing in Fantasy Gardens, the parks dedicated area for taking photos with Disney characters.\nDisneyland Paris\nAfter excitedly entering Disneyland Paris, which opened in 1992, visitors are greeted with an arcade that features a small replica of the Statue of Liberty  a gift from France to America in 1886, making it a fitting introduction to Europes only instance of this American theme park. The covered arcade is one of two on Main Street, replacing the open spaces of its counterpart in California, and offering essential cover from the cold and rain that typically hits Paris.\nAs you venture further into Disneyland Paris, you will see other changes. Gone is Tom Sawyers Island  a staple of the US theme parks  since the character is little-known in Europe. Instead there is Discoveryland dedicated to European visionaries, such as Leonardo da Vinci with the Orbitron attraction, a rocket ship ride in the style proposed by the Italian inventor; and Jules Verne with Les Mystres du Nautilus, an attraction that lets visitors walk through the rooms of Captain Nemos submarine, as featured in Vernes novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. The great artists of cinema are revered in CineMagique, a theatre show unique to Paris, featuring French director and actress Julie Delpy on screen with synchronized live actors. And the character Remy, a French chef rat from the Disney cartoon Ratatouille, will be given his own ride in 2014, titled Ratatouille: Kitchen Calamity, complete with an attached restaurant to match the cartoons fine-dining kitchen.\nUnfortunately, the French stereotype of a smoking, wine drinker is upheld in Disneyland Paris. Many visitors complain that although the theme park is supposed to be outfitted with dedicated smoking areas, most smokers seem to puff away in all the open areas, including in queues for rides. It is also the only Disneyland in the world where you can enjoy an alcoholic drink with your meal; a French meal without a glass of wine would make for the unhappiest place in the world.\nShanghai Disneyland\nAt the 2011 opening ceremony for the sixth Disneyland, set to open at the end of 2015, Disney said the Shanghai-based park will include characteristics tailored to the Shanghai region and other amenities consistent with Disney's destination resorts worldwide.\nThe ceremony followed this lead, featuring traditional Chinese drum music and Mickey Mouse dressed in a traditional, red Tang Chinese suit -- a collarless silk jacket with matching trousers, resplendent with gold accents on the embroidered jacket, toggle buttoning and trouser cuffs.\nWhen Disneyland Paris opened, it was criticised by French intellectuals for not incorporating more local culture. Even in 2002, 10 years after its first day in operation, Parisian theatre director Ariane Mnouchkine called the theme park in Paris a cultural Chernobyl, which still holds true if you arent a fan of American culture, as few further nods to French culture have been added to Disneyland Paris. This criticism led Disney to take extra care when adding culturally specific elements to their parks in both Hong Kong and Tokyo. If the opening ceremony in grand Chinese style is anything to go by, Shanghai Disneyland may become the most customised Disneyland yet, to make the most populous nation in the world the happiest place in the world."", 'description': 'Disney may have started in the US, but its international theme parks have been infused with locally familiar elements, from feng shui in Hong Kong to European inventors in Paris.', 'source_domain': 'www.bbc.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Hong'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Kong'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Disney'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##land'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.bbc.com'], 'dates': ['2012-12-18T00:00:00'], 'languages': ['']}",1

"The U. S. Supreme Court building stands quietly before dawn in Washington, Friday, Oct. 5, 2018.",0,1,3,5.986024856567383,"[{'title': 'We had such trust, we feel such fools: how shocking hospital mistakes led to our daughters death', 'date': '2022-09-03T07:00:12', 'content': 'At the start of last summer, my 13-year-old daughter Martha was busy with life. Shed meet her friends in the park, make silly videos on her phone and play kiss, marry, kill. Her days were filled with books and memorising song lyrics. Shed wonder aloud if she might become an author, an engineer or a film director. Her future was brimming with promise, crowded with plans.\nBy the end of the summer she was dead, after shocking mistakes were made at one of the UKs leading hospitals.\nWhat follows is an account of how Martha was allowed to die, but also what happens when you have blind faith in doctors  and learn too late what you should have known to save your childs life. What I learned, I now want everyone to know. In a small way, I hope Marthas story might change how some people think about healthcare; it might even save a life.\nI am a fierce supporter of the principles of the NHS and realise how many excellent doctors are practising today. Theres no need for the usual political arguments: as the hospital in question has confirmed to me, what happened to Martha had nothing to do with insufficient resources or overstretched doctors and nurses; it had nothing to do with austerity or cuts, or a health service under strain.\nNo matter how many times Im told that it was the doctors job to look after Martha, I know, deep down, that had I acted differently, shed still be living, and my life would not now be broken. Its not that I think Im to blame: the hospital has admitted breach of duty of care and talked of a catastrophic error. But if Id been more aware of how hospitals work and how some doctors behave, my daughter would be with me now.\nAs another bereaved parent told me, life after the death of your child is like being on an island, separate from the mainland where the normal people live. You so badly want to go back there but you never can. Youre stuck on the island for ever.\nI had booked a cottage on the outskirts of Snowdonia national park. It was a small, old farmhouse with low-slung beams and no wifi or phone reception; parking was at the bottom of a hill on which sheep grazed. We ferried our bags to the door in a wheelbarrow, which Martha and her younger sister, Lottie, wanted rides in, too. Our first day was sunny: we went bodyboarding on Barmouth beach and Martha and I painted the valley view from the cottage. We had a meal in a pub, played cards  everything was holiday-easy, filled with light.\nOn the second day, we rented bikes and set out on a well-known cycle path: nine miles of old railway line, to the beach and back. A guide to the area described the route as scenic, flat and family-friendly. On the way, Martha rode alongside me and I remember we talked about body hair (she wanted to know if she should shave her armpits). We swam in the sea, ate crab sandwiches and chips. But soon after we started back on our bikes, Martha slipped on a patch of sand that had blown from the beach on to the path. She was cycling slowly  Captain Sensible was our nickname for her  but she fell, and was soon making the zombie sounds of someone badly winded.\nThe path was busy with other cyclists, so she crawled to the edge. As we waited for her to recover, another family with a much younger child cycled by. This girl also skidded on the sand but wobbled and stayed upright, so the family continued on their way. No doubt they will never think of that moment again.\nMartha felt no better, so we took her to a minor injuries unit. When she raised her T-shirt for examination, we saw a red ring on her stomach: as she fell, she had landed with the full weight of her body on one end of her twisted handlebars. There was no blood or cut, only the O-shaped mark.\nThe nurse described the injury on the phone to a doctor who said he didnt need to see Martha  it was probably internal bruising  and prescribed paracetamol. I wondered whether to make a fuss and insist the doctor look at her; I didnt and we went back to the cottage. But by 2am Martha was sick and in pain, so we decided we must take her to A&E. I cant make it down the hill to the car, she said, but Paul, her dad, pushed her in the wheelbarrow, trying to navigate the bumps while Lottie held up a phone as a torch. We manoeuvred Martha into the car as gently as we could.\nAt Bronglais hospital in Aberystwyth, they agreed to run tests and keep her in overnight for observation. I still imagined this was just a precaution, but at dawn a doctor with a serious expression told us that Martha probably had pancreatic trauma: she had fallen with such force that her pancreas had been pushed against her spine, causing a laceration.\nI knew immediately that the injury was serious, but had absolute faith in the system. Two years of Covid had seen us talk endlessly to the girls about how lucky we were to have the NHS. Martha and Lottie painted rainbows with the words Thank You and put them in our window. For a few weeks we stood outside the door on Thursdays and joined the communal clapping; Martha banged a pan with a wooden spoon.\nI was so confident in her recovery that I started taking photos  they would be props when she told the story of her summer misadventure. The first captures her curled asleep in the blue wash light of her Aberystwyth hospital room. In the next, she is outside the helicopter that took us over the Brecon Beacons to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. The paramedic is leaning over her shoulder and they are both giving a cheerful wave to the camera.\nAt Cardiff, Martha was taken to intensive care and hooked up to the kind of bleeping monitors I knew only from TV dramas. She had one-to-one nursing  a nurse was with her all the time, standing behind a kind of lectern at the foot of her bed. None of us had been hospitalised before and I was frantic, but one of the doctors gripped me by the shoulders: Its going to be a tricky couple of days  but shell be fine.\nI was already Googling. Pancreatic trauma, in adults, is usually seen alongside other organ damage in victims of car crashes or shootings: I thought of the O on her stomach  a bullet wound without the bullet. In children, its most often associated with bike injuries  BMX jumps and stunts gone wrong. What matters is identifying the injury quickly, before corrosive juices escaping the pancreas cause too much damage. I was so relieved wed made our middle-of-the-night dash to the hospital.\nFrom Cardiff, Martha was helicoptered to Kings College hospital in London  one of three specialist centres in England that deal with pancreatic injuries in children. There she was installed on Rays of Sunshine ward which, as the nurses told us, is well funded, through a combination of NHS money, donations and the fees of private patients who come from around the world.\nMartha had a glass cubicle with a TV; the ward had new equipment and a playroom  some children, including liver transplant patients, stay there a long while. You are in the best place, we were repeatedly told. Plastered around the walls were posters for the Great Hospital Hike  a September fundraiser for Kings, which I resolved to sign up to, in thanks. We are so lucky to be here, Paul and I said to each other.\nIt turned out, however, that Martha was cosmically unlucky. Her injury was treatable: she became the first child on record at Kings to die of it  after the care for her became careless. Her preventable death is an example of what a hospital official described to us, in a barbarous phrase, as a poor outcome. I will spend decades asking: why was my child the one to suffer such an unlikely fate?\nI became pregnant with Martha at the age of 29 and it all happened so fast I wasnt sure it was the right thing. I loved my job, I was enjoying life  the parties, the freedom. I worried I might be too selfish to be a parent, that a baby might cramp my style. But when she emerged, battered and bruised from being round the wrong way inside me, I was instantly changed. As I told a friend at the time, I felt I had been punched in the face by love.\nShe was such an easy baby, people told Paul and I we were great parents. Naturally we took the compliment, but the truth is she just came out that way  sanguine and content. Im as jolly as a jolly-bird, she used to say when young, and that summed up her temperament nicely.\nOn Rays of Sunshine, Paul and I would take turns to spend 24 hours at Marthas side, sleeping next to her on a foldaway bed. We were told every day that her recovery was never in doubt: it was just a matter of time and patience. After a fortnight, she was walking down the corridor and friends came to visit. One doctor told her: Im going on holiday, and I hope not to see you when Im back. We got used to the routine on the ward: nurses taking observations, the early morning blood test, the travails of the boy in the next-door cubicle who also had pancreatic trauma from a handlebar accident. We put pictures of our cat on the cubicle walls.\nI grabbed snacks on the ground floor of the hospital. On my way down there one day, I saw two women shouting in rage. Fackin murderers, one screamed, her hands cupped around her mouth. She wanted everyone to hear. Lets get away from the fucking killers, shouted the other, as they headed for the exit. I recoiled, and instinctively took the side of the doctors.\nMartha was nil by mouth and given milky formula through a tube up her nose. With no meals to break up the tedium of hospital days, she would stare longingly at pictures of lasagne and roast potatoes on her phone. On the breaks from her milk feed, Id run her a bath and mix in bath salts from home to give her a hit of luxury. Shed soak in the tub and her brown hair would fan out behind her in the water  the tips blond where I had dip-dyed them at the start of the summer. Id wash it for her, as I did for so many years when she was young.\nWe often saw a different consultant each day, and now and then would wonder who had overall responsibility for Marthas care: I wish now wed done more than wonder. Every morning, during the ward round, wed ask the consultants questions about how the treatment worked. We tried to be articulate and grateful  these were the experts and we wanted to bring out the best in them. It turns out we were judged in the medical notes: Mum and Dad pleasant and helpful, reads one entry.\nThe consultants swooped in, and were ostentatiously deferred to by the junior doctors. They were chatty, assertive, grand. We heard about a research paper one especially self-regarding surgeon  Ill call him Prof Bow Tie  was due to give in Athens; he posted the view from his luxury hotel on Instagram a couple of days after Martha died.\nFollowing the ward round, Martha was looked after each day by junior doctors. They seemed young, but carried themselves with confidence, so I assumed they knew everything about Marthas care. I was so naive I didnt even realise they were training.\nAmong the Get Well Soon cards and gifts sent to Martha was a reversible toy octopus that could be flipped to have a happy or sad face: she began to use it to mark her good and bad days. A few weeks into her time on the ward, on the weekend of 21-22 August, she developed a fever. The octopus was frowning and Martha said she was scared. For the umpteenth time, I praised her bravery and promised her thered be another side to this. This is a great hospital, I told her. She lay shivering, had constant diarrhoea and would retch, spitting the nothingness in her stomach into cardboard bowls wed hold under her face.\nThe doctors prescribed antibiotics and said they would get rid of the infection within 72 hours. What happens if they dont work? Martha asked. They will, she was told. But what happens if they dont? They will. We gave her ice-packs for her temperature and hot-water bottles for her back pain. Shed wander into the corridor to stand under the air conditioning vent, dropping her head backwards so she could feel the rush of cold on her face. I would put my arm around her shoulders to guide her back to bed.\nShort-lived infections, we knew, could happen during her treatment. But on Wednesday Marthas fever was still there. And something else, even more worrying: she started to bleed from both the line in her arm and the tube from her abdomen. The blood oozed through her bandages and soaked through her pyjamas and sheets. This bleeding, we found out after she died, is very rare for her injury and a recognised sign of severe sepsis.\nWhile the doctors knew she had sepsis, they never used that word when talking to Paul or me  just infection. I wish they had, because I would then have found out more. I was told merely that Marthas clotting abilities were slightly off, which was a normal side-effect of infection.\nHospitals use a guide to help doctors and nurses decide when to raise concerns about child patients, called BPEWS  it stands for Bedside Paediatric Early Warning Score and involves heart rate, temperature, blood pressure and other measures. We later found out that on Wednesday Marthas BPEWS was six  a high score  and that there should have been a discussion about transfer to intensive care.\nBut Martha stayed on the ward and carried on bleeding. The medical notes say I was very distressed, but all the doctors told me shed turn a corner, and of course I wanted to be reassured. A scan showed a small amount of fluid around her heart  another sign of sepsis, we later discovered. Action was delayed until after the bank holiday weekend and we were told nothing about it.\nSevere sepsis is most often dangerous when patients dont make it to intensive care, where it can be treated with powerful drugs and frequent interventions. Martha could easily have gone to paediatric intensive care (PICU), which was just down the corridor and had beds free. But her consultants preferred not to involve PICU.\nLiving with a child for 14 years, they become a part of you: a year after Marthas death, its still so hard to break the lovely habit of her. I think of her unwrapping an ordinary present of underwear: she shouted Knickers! and threw them up in the air to land on our heads. Her laugh was a gift: there was nothing to match her collapsing into giggles, head thrown back, clutching her stomach.\nShe enjoyed cutting her dad down to size, and would tease him about the time he cycled his bike into the canal. A romantic, she loved to hear the tale of Paul and I getting engaged. And there was her cello playing, and the songs she wrote, her poems. She mapped out a whole novel at the beginning of the summer, and her notebooks were full of ideas for stories (The Story of Nothing: Every book starts with nothing. But in this case, Nothing is a boy. And this story is how Nothing turns into Something  )\nAt Marthas memorial, a school friend of hers said: For me, there were two sides to Martha  the person who danced with me on the train platform; the one who had fun, sassy arguments in American accents with me; the one who would put a PE bag on her back and call herself a turtle. Then there was the one who quietly sang while I rested on her shoulder on the train home. She would always be there for me, and I would be there for her, too.\nThe doctors gave Martha lots of clotting products and her bleeding finally stopped on Friday morning. Yet as early as lunchtime she was in tears about her ongoing fever. She no longer wanted to read  she always read  or play Minecraft with friends on her phone. A fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda, she showed no interest when I suggested we watch his new film.\nThe doctors didnt know the source of the infection, and the bank holiday weekend was approaching. On weekends, the ward took on a different atmosphere  the corridor was eerily quiet and after ward round the consultants went home, on call. An extended weekend and a persistent fever seemed a worrying combination.\nAt this point, we made the link ourselves between infection and the worst-case consequence  septic shock, a leading cause of hospital deaths. I searched out that days consultant and said: Im worried Martha is going to go into septic shock on a bank holiday weekend and none of you will be here. The consultant ran her finger down a screen of numbers. Im not worried about sepsis, she said. When I went back to the cubicle, Martha looked at me with narrowed eyes. I heard you talking about septic shock. Dont worry, my love, I said. I just need to make sure theyre thinking of everything. The consultants parting words as she left were: Its just a normal infection.\nI was reassured again when the businesslike, blase head of the team of consultants told Paul on Saturday morning: This is what its like with this injury  infections come and go. But Marthas fever continued and later, when she tried to stand, she felt very light-headed and dizzy. Paul told the junior doctors: This is new.\nOn Sunday of the bank holiday weekend I was with Martha. I recall that days ward round, when the consultant  Ill call him Prof Checked Shirt  talked in hushed tones with a surgeon outside Marthas cubicle. We later found out that she was much worse than they were expecting. But they revealed nothing of this to me and I saw neither of them for the rest of the day. Martha was left in the hands of two junior doctors, one  the registrar, whom Ill call Dr Blunder  more experienced than the other.\nProf Checked Shirt  an Oxford-educated man in his late 50s with an air of supreme confidence  left for home early in the afternoon. In his absence, when on call, he was to play a pivotal role in Marthas death. By lunchtime, she had unexplained sepsis, a high fever, very low blood pressure and a racing heart. Kings later produced a Serious Incident report into why Martha died and its writer told me that she should, at this time, have been moved to PICU.\nBut Prof Checked Shirt, in charge that day, didnt once consider such a move. Tellingly, the report revealed high-status consultants on Rays of Sunshine (level sevens in the ranking of seniority) had a dismissive attitude to less senior colleagues in PICU (level fives). This made them reluctant to do the right thing and involve intensive care: Martha died in part because of inflated egos.\nThen, early on Sunday afternoon, she developed an angry red rash; it spread across her legs and neck and torso. A rash is a red flag for sepsis. Yet Dr Blunder  headstrong, with no experience of this kind of situation and despite Marthas other symptoms  somehow convinced himself that the rash was caused by a delayed drug reaction. I made clear to him my anxiety that it was a sepsis rash, but it made no difference.\nI left Marthas cubicle to look for an ally and grabbed a nurse: we walked down the corridor together. Im worried hes got it wrong. Ive been trying to look it up online. The nurse stopped walking and put her hand on my arm. Dont look things up on the internet, she said, youll only worry yourself. Trust the doctors  they know what theyre doing. I followed this advice. It turned out to be the worst I will receive in my whole life.\nMartha had an unshowy confidence that I admired. By the time she got to secondary school, she hadnt worn a skirt for a couple of years and I was aware that, while trousers were an option for girls, nearly all of them wore skirts. I wondered how she would cope. Should I buy you an insurance skirt just in case? I asked her. No, she said, just the trousers. When she met fellow students before the first term began, they stood comparing notes. Were going to wear skirts, right? Yeah, skirts, definitely. I watched Martha out of the corner of my eye as they all agreed. I like trousers, she said, quietly. She wore trousers and before long, others did, too.\nMartha never got to have a first kiss. She was good friends with a boy in her class, who used to find it funny that her favourite word was defenestration. There was another boy she was keen on, but we never got to see how that played out. In the hospital, she and I had a chat about gender and sexuality. I asked her, Do you ever think you might be gay? She said: Im pretty sure I am straight. But who knows  maybe I just havent met the right woman yet.\nDr Blunders misdiagnosis of the rash was described as such a mistake by the coroner at the inquest into Marthas death. Even unpressured clinicians make errors, though rarely ones so glaring and cataclysmic. But Im still mystified about what happened next.\nAt 5pm, Martha had a score of eight on the BPEWS chart. We werent told, but Dr Blunder phoned Prof Checked Shirt, at home, to tell him. The consultant didnt consider coming in. Though he admits he wasnt at all sure Dr Blunders diagnosis was correct, he failed to suggest the rash might be caused by sepsis. Dr Blunder spoke to him again later, but it was felt no change in Marthas care was needed. Because of the strict hierarchy that exists in hospitals, no one on the ward took the initiative. She wasnt moved.\nWhen Prof Checked Shirt made his routine call from home that evening to the head of PICU, he painted only a partial picture of Marthas condition. He did not mention her previous bleeding or the fact that the rash she had was new. He was relaying her details for information only; intensive care categorically should not pay Martha a bedside visit, he said: no review was needed and it would increase my anxiety. The hospitals policy dictates that parents being worried is a reason to escalate; he decided the opposite.\nThe head of PICU could reply only that there was a bed available if needed. He was asked at the inquest whether, had he been given the full picture by Prof Checked Shirt, Martha would have been moved to intensive care. He answered: Without a doubt, 100 per cent.\nAfter Marthas death, Prof Checked Shirt was very reluctant to use the word mistake to describe his actions, though his error had been identified by colleagues. Other consultants were also at fault: the hospital report concluded that on at least five occasions Marthas care should have involved PICU. Yet at no stage did any doctor let me know that she was in real trouble. I was kept in the dark and condescended to. The focus on my  justified  anxiety reeks of misogyny.\nAnd, unbelievable as it seems to us now, neither Paul nor I knew that intensive care was the right place for Martha to be. We didnt know enough to argue, to challenge, to insist that she should be moved there. So we ended up failing to fulfil the most essential duty of parents  to protect our child when she was in danger. The guilt will always be with me.\nThat evening shift brought a new junior doctor, who worked alongside Dr Blunder. It was made clear to her that Martha needed constant monitoring. (After Martha died, the notes from this vital handover mysteriously disappeared from Kings computer system.) It was decided not to perform a vital blood test  who knows why; doing so could easily have saved Marthas life. An instruction that she should have one-to-one nursing failed to get carried out.\nWhats more, this junior doctor (Dr Do-Nothing) didnt once walk down the corridor to visit Martha, to set eyes on the wards most critically ill patient, even though the nurse passed on worrying observations.\nI promised Martha yet again shed get through this. Youve said that so many times its become meaningless, she said. Throughout that night, her thirst was unquenchable. Water, she gasped at regular intervals. I refilled bottles  but she couldnt seem to get enough. Shes drinking crazy amounts of water, I told the nurse, more than once. I was exhausted and didnt realise this was yet another sign of disaster. Still, Dr Do-Nothing decided it wasnt worth walking a few metres to see my daughter.\nAt 5.45am, Martha told me she needed the toilet. But as she moved to sit down, her body stiffened and her eyes rolled back in her head. I caught her as she started fitting and convulsing. Her body jerked in my arms and I was barely able to hold her weight as diarrhoea poured out of her. Sepsis happens when the body overreacts to an infection and damages its own organs and tissues: the seizure was caused by not enough blood getting to her brain.\nI now panicked for the first time and started screaming: what is wrong with her? After a few moments, she came round and the nurses fussed over her. In tears, I corralled the senior nurse who told me of course my daughter wasnt going to die and that I should pull myself together. I washed my face and returned to the cubicle. Martha and I were alone together when she hovered her hand above her torso and looked at me with fear in her eyes and quietly said: It feels like its unfixable. At night, these words wake me in a surge of terror and panic.\nIt was only when the blood test was finally done that Dr Do-Nothing woke up to the fact that her patient was dangerously ill. Martha was taken to intensive care, but arrived there too late to break the cycle of septic shock. That evening, there was a last-ditch transfer to Great Ormond Street childrens hospital for Martha to be attached to a machine that would act as heart and lungs outside her body. But it didnt work. Martha died in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\nI could write pages about the horrors of that last day. Let me simply describe her move out of Rays of Sunshine, the move that should so obviously have happened before. Marthas cubicle was suddenly filled with purposeful PICU clinicians. Please make sure shes better by Saturday, I said weakly. Its her birthday. Once in intensive care, Martha had an oxygen mask clamped to her face, but she thought it was an anaesthetic that should be putting her to sleep. This isnt working, she said, pointing at the mask. I tried to tell her it was oxygen but Im not sure she heard. Within seconds they forced a tube down her throat; she gagged and her back arched before the strong sedative took hold. I love you, I love you, I love you I said over and over. And suddenly Martha was in a coma from which she would never wake up.\nI know many of the details of Marthas deterioration because of the report, the questions we have put to Kings since her death, and the inquest, which concluded that her doctors failed to heed the warning signs and move her to PICU. Hospitals have a duty of candour  they are supposed to be transparent about mistakes made. In our case, Kings behaved much better than some, but there were obvious limits and important questions were left unanswered.\nThe hospital trust issued an apology but kept its legal team close. Improvements were identified  necessarily so  which is why everyone at Kings was more comfortable talking to us about systems than the crucial actions of particular clinicians. The trust closed ranks and we entered the familiar, enervated world of institutional condolences and lessons to be learned. A hospital will do what it can to protect its doctors from the tragedies they cause.\nAfter all, how could they ever comprehend the consequences? Their lives continue while mine has stopped. (Dr Blunder was promoted to consultant within a week of Marthas death.) Each day, I experience wave after wave of nausea, misery and disbelief. Although my father died when I was 10, I never understood grief until now. I know many people walk around in shadow, normal life a pale memory. But I would be dishonest if I didnt admit to thinking about how deaths are different, and grieving is different, too.\nI cant stop dwelling on the fact that Marthas was a preventable death (one of 150 in the NHS every week). Our culture may talk more about grief these days, but most people prefer to engage with a valiant battle with cancer than a death caused by medical mistakes, especially that of a child  the most unfaceable of fears. After Martha died, we received one card that said: It is what we all dread  and it has happened to you.\nAs absurd or insensitive as it seems, I even find myself envious of the circumstances of other childrens deaths. One father whose daughter died of an aggressive bone cancer told me he found comfort in learning that Spains football manager had lost his child to the same disease. If he could do nothing, with all the money and fame at his disposal, the father told me, then there was nothing that could be done. I have no such solace.\nI understand the arguments for a no-blame or just culture NHS; this is not the place to rehearse them. More important is something thats obvious but doesnt get said enough: our trust in doctors should have limits. Medicine is like any other job: there are many talented workers in the NHS, but also those who are less dedicated and less able. Think of the old medics joke: What do you call the guy who graduated last in his medical school class? Doctor. There are plenty of clinicians prone to arrogance and complacency. Some doctors are heroes, but we should stop thinking of them all as such.\nHowever indebted you feel to the NHS, dont be afraid to challenge decisions if you have good reason to. Its easy to feel cowed, but hold your ground. Remember most of the doctors in hospitals are just training. Dont be afraid to ask how long a clinician has been qualified. Junior doctors are often green and trying to stay composed to impress their superiors. Make sure, if you can, that a single consultant has overall responsibility: we all know that if youre answerable for something, you try harder.\nIgnore the advice and look everything up on the internet. Google like crazy, educate yourself, ask questions and, if you are unsure, insist on a second opinion, or a third. Remember that its entirely possible you will be managed and reassured but not told the full truth. We certainly werent.\nBe aware that much care in hospitals is less thorough at weekends. And understand the damage done by the hierarchical, patrician system  everyone defers to the most senior consultant. If things seem to be going wrong: shout the ward down. In our case, the cost of not doing so was too great. We had such trust; we feel such fools.\nNow I live on the island. Instead of having Martha in the house, we go to visit her grave. Some of the inscriptions on the headstones nearby would have amused her: Philosopher, Teacher, Nudist, International Man of Mystery, Forever Loved, Always Right. But the people buried alongside her lived for seven or eight decades. Martha should have walked out of hospital like all the other children with her injury. Now Lottie has an empty bedroom next to hers, and a bench in the park with a plaque: To my sister.\nId like to imagine a world in which Martha was transferred to intensive care in time and her life was saved. In this parallel universe, my daughter makes it to her 14th birthday. I talk endlessly about the doctors and nurses who helped her. I go on that fundraising walk. Bright and determined girl as she was, Martha aces all her exams and goes to a good university. I can just see her, laughing over a drink, getting stuck into student life, having a time of it. I wonder what Ill do for my GCSEs, she wrote in her diary soon after starting secondary school: It might affect my whole life. In this fantasy, Martha has a career and the children I knew she one day wanted. She visits us at weekends and we recall those distant weeks when she was in hospital.\nOh, how I would love to live in that world.', 'description': 'Martha was 13; her whole life stretched out ahead of her.

The migrants said they were asking that the Trump Administration pay them $50,000 each or allow them into the U.S.\nWhen asked how the group came up with the $50,000 figure, organizer Alfonso Guerrero Ulloa of Honduras, said they chose that number as a group ...\n[A] second letter, delivered around 1:20 p.m., came from a separate group of caravan members asking for the U.S. to speed up the asylum process. Specifically, the group asked U.S. immigration officials to admit up to 300 asylum seekers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry each day.\nCurrently, officials admit between 40 and 100 asylum seekers. The group of migrants say the slow pace violates American and international laws that call for an immediate process, and places vulnerable migrants at risk.\nThe Union-Tribune reported that the group demanding money in exchange for turning around and going home was organized by Alfonso Guerrero Ulloa, a 54-year-old Honduran who sought political asylum in Mexico after being accused (falsely, he maintains) by the Honduran government of planting a bomb in a Chinese restaurant that injured six U.S. soldiers and a civilian in 1987.\nUlloa joined the caravan in early November 2018 and viewed it as something of a political cause, according to the Union-Tribune:\n[Ulloa] led a group of 100 migrants to the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana asking President Donald Trump to either let the migrants into the United States or oust [Honduran President Juan Orlando] Hernandez from office and pay each migrant $50,000 to go back to Honduras. He based that figure on what he considers reparations from the U.S. for their intervention in Central America.\nThe United States is directly responsible for this humanitarian crisis, he said. Honduras is practically colonized by the United States.\nThe Trump administration has sought to require that Central American migrants apply for asylum in the safe third country of Mexico rather than in the U.S. According to the Union-Tribune, roughly 2,500 have already done so, but humanitarian groups -- including the international medical charity Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) -- maintain that Mexico (still a developing country) is not safe for many of them, with women, children, and members of the LGBT community particularly vulnerable to violence in Mexico:\nMSF medical data shows that a quarter of our medical consultations for migrants and refugees in Mexico are related to injuries from intentional violence.

An agent of Congo's National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) marks a vote on a blackboard during vote-counting following the elections.,0,1,4,7.288811683654785,"[{'title': 'Vote rigging: How to spot the tell-tale signs', 'date': '2016-09-02T01:06:42', 'content': 'Watch the turnout figures  they can be a big giveaway.\nYou never get a 98% or 99% turnout in an honest election. You just don\'t.\nVoting is compulsory in Gabon, but it is not enforced; even in Australia where it is enforced, where you can vote by post or online and can be fined for not voting, turnout only reaches 90-95%.\nThe main reason that a full turnout is practically impossible is that electoral registers, even if they are recently compiled, can rarely be 100% up-to-date.\nEven if no-one gets sick or has to travel, people still die. And when a register is updated, new voters are keen to add themselves to the list.\nNo-one, however, has any great enthusiasm for removing the names of those who have died, and over time the number of these non-existent voters increases.\nI once reported on an election in the Niger Delta where some areas had a turnout of more than 120%.\n""They\'re very healthy people round here, and very civic-minded,"" a local official assured me.\nBut a turnout of more than 100%, in an area or an individual polling station, is a major red flag and a reason to cancel the result and re-run the election.\nEven where the turnout is within the bounds of possibility, if the figure is wildly different from the turnout elsewhere, it serves as a warning.\nWhy would one particular area, or one individual polling station, have a 90% turnout, while most other areas register less than 70%?\nSomething strange is almost certainly going on, especially if the high turnout is an area which favours one particular candidate or party over another.\nWhen the polls close, and before they open the boxes, election officials normally have to go through a complicated and rather tedious process known as the reconciliation of ballots.\nAfter they have counted how many ballot papers they received in the morning, they then need to count how many are left, and how many  if any  were torn or otherwise spoiled and had to be put aside.\nThe result will tell them how many papers should be in the box. It should also match the number of names checked off on the register.\nThe first task when the box is opened is to count the number of papers inside, this is done prior to counting the votes for the different candidates.\nIf there is a discrepancy, something is wrong. And if there are more papers in the boxes than were issued by the polling staff, it is highly likely that someone has been doing some ""stuffing"".\nThat\'s a good enough reason to cancel the result and arrange a re-run.\nMobile phones have made elections much more transparent.\nIt is now standard practice to allow party agents, observers and sometimes even voters to watch the counting process and take photographs of the results sheet with their phones.\nThey then have proof of the genuine results from their area  just in case the ones announced later by the electoral commission don\'t match.\nIt has clearly taken crooked politicians some time to catch up with the fact that people will now know if they change the results.\nWhere these systems have proved too demanding for the context, as in Malawi last year, they can actually increase delays as staff struggle to make the technology work.\nIn that particular case the results eventually had to be transmitted the old fashioned way; placed in envelopes and driven down to the capital under police escort.\nBy then, allegations of rigging were flying.\nDelay is certainly dangerous, fuelling rumours of results being ""massaged"" before release and increasing tensions, but this is not incontrovertible proof of rigging.', 'description': 'Elizabeth Blunt, who witnessed her first African election in Nigeria in 1979, looks at how to spot the tell-tale signs of possible rigging.', 'source_domain': 'www.bbc.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Congo'}, {'entity': 'B-ORG', 'word': 'National'}, {'entity': 'I-ORG', 'word': 'Independent'}, {'entity': 'I-ORG', 'word': 'Electoral'}, {'entity': 'I-ORG', 'word': 'Commission'}, {'entity': 'B-ORG', 'word': 'CE'}, {'entity': 'I-ORG', 'word': '##NI'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.bbc.com'], 'dates': ['2016-09-02T01:06:42'], 'languages': ['']}",1
Fancy meeting you hare,0,1,9,6.635277271270752,"[{'title': ""What's the perfect time for dinner?"", 'date': '2011-12-05T00:00:00', 'content': 'A while ago, when I wrote about a restaurant booking service, I was picked up in the comments about my presumptions about the right time for an evening meal. I had blithely condemned 6.30pm as an eccentric time to eat dinner in a restaurant, but counted 7pm among the good slots. As @ihatesummer pointed out, there\'s only 30 minutes in it. But could they be the most significant 30 minutes in the restaurant-goer\'s schedule?\nI must admit that, due to the demands of a small boy who likes to hit the hay on the dot of seven, dinner is ""taken"" at home at 6.15pm. But I\'d never willingly book a table for that time; the idea of eating out before 7pm seems to me to be all kinds of wrong, just as starting at 9pm causes havoc with both digestion and babysitters.\nThe stretch between 5pm and 7pm is the time that no-one wants. They might only just have finished work, been on the Hobnobs all afternoon, or need to get a drink under their belts first. It is widely known that the great arts of theatre, cinema, opera and ballet were invented to sell restaurant seats during the early and late shifts - the only successful strategy developed so far. Lower prices, wine offers or set menus were also developed, but in vain; in all but the buzziest, urban, all-day places, there\'ll be tumbleweed rolling across the floor as the waiting team, smelling of fags, rehearse the specials and ignore the couple taking ""advantage"" of the Early Bird deal.\nConsumption is, of course, a matter of science as well as pleasure. Many weight-loss regimes require followers to eat their ""big"" meal earlier in the day, to maximise the time available for the body to process it. Is there an optimal time for dinner? Dr Joan Ransley, honorary lecturer in human nutrition at the University of Leeds, says not. ""Eating just before you go to bed does affect gastric emptying because you\'re lying down. But the most important thing to remember,"" she says, glancing briefly at my hair, ""is that we are not lions on the Serengeti. We don\'t thrive on one huge meal, and then nothing. We need to eat roughly every four hours, so it really depends on when you had lunch.""\nForeigners have their own ideas, as is their perfect right. I can find no definitive statistics on the dream dinner time for most Americans, but they have a reputation for eating out at a time when the rest of the civilised world would barely have digested lunch. In continental Europe, of course, things are terrifyingly different. The Frommer\'s guide to Spain reports that ""the chic dining hour, even in one-donkey towns, is 10 or 10:30pm"", whereas in Denmark, home of the zeitgeisty Sarah Lund, ""farmer\'s hours"", starting at 6.30pm, are kept. Frommer\'s, wisely, does not pronounce on English habits.\nThere are always extenuating circumstances. One of the reasons 6.30pm doesn\'t work for me is that I like to eat in a well-populated dining room. I\'ll go, lamblike, whenever (though not wherever, obviously) the majority does. This approach proved useless during a walking holiday in Spain. In the middle of Murcia, far from stopgap tapas and with an eight-mile walk in our legs and a limited supply of patatas fritas, waiting until the chic dining hour was impossible. We ended up the only 7.30pm diners in our lovely hotel which compassionately gave us a semi-private alcove to hide our shame; as we were sipping coffee and raisiny PX, local customers, including lots of kids, were piling in for a sliver of pre-dinner jamn.\nFor many restaurant geeks who have cultivated their own habits and preferences, the faultline appears where desirable restaurant meets unwanted dinner slot. If the only chance of eating somewhere at the bleeding edge of culinary adventure in the next 12 months is to have dinner at 10.30pm, is taking the table a show of Yogi-like flexibility or a compromise too far?', 'description': ""What's your chosen time to sit down to an evening meal in a restaurant?"", 'source_domain': 'www.theguardian.com'}]",[],1,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.theguardian.com'], 'dates': ['2011-12-05T00:00:00'], 'languages': ['']}",1

I loved Janet Malcolm\'s last book, Iphigenia in Forest Hills, and so will be falling upon her new one, Forty-One False Starts, a collection of essays and profiles, if only for the great title. While we are on numbered titles, I might catch up with Elif Shafak\'s The Forty Rules of Love; with recent events in Turkey, her work has become more important than ever. Each summer, I try to read something I\'m ashamed to have not read and this summer it\'s going to be (big admission here) Mary Shelley\'s Frankenstein.\nJulian Barnes\nNovelist\nFor the flight (and for a reminder that the activity was once much more dangerous) I shall take Richard Holmes\'s history of ballooning and balloonatics, Falling Upwards. As every five years or so, it\'s time to reread The Great Gatsby (which also contains a theme of upward mobility); but for once it can be followed by the chaser of Sarah Churchwell\'s Careless People, a kind of biography of that perfect novel. John Williams\'s Stoner is not about drugs  or written by the guitarist  but by a forgotten American; first published in 1965, it is one of those purely sad, sadly pure novels that deserves to be rediscovered.\nHilary Mantel\nNovelist\nSince I holiday at home and don\'t have to pay excess baggage, I look forward to Modernity Britain, the latest in David Kynaston\'s series of postwar histories: these are volumes full of treasure, serious history with a human face. I can recommend Louise Doughty\'s new thriller, Apple Tree Yard: guaranteed to have you on the edge of your sun-lounger. And this may be the season I finally enjoy Richard Ford\'s modern classic The Sportswriter, which has sat on my shelves for many summers.\nJohn Lanchester\nNovelist\nTwo brilliant books by young writers that I\'ve looked at and am looking forward to reading properly are Money by Felix Martin and Idiopathy by Sam Byers. They\'re respectively a fascinating new way of telling the story of what money is and a mordantly riveting first novel about what it\'s like to be a thirtysomething. Joe Brainard\'s I Remember is republished in a beautiful new form by Notting Hill Editions. Every section in it starts with the words ""I remember"": it was the inspiration for two of my favourite pieces of autobiographical writing, Georges Perec\'s Je me souviens and Harry Mathews\'s The Orchard. It\'s a quarter of a century since I read Proust so I\'m going to tackle him again, starting with the translation of Swann\'s Way by one of my favourite writers, Lydia Davis.\nHelen Dunmore\nPoet\nThe recent publication of Deirdre Madden\'s Time Present and Time Past sent me back to her earlier novels. One By One in the Darkness is one of the finest books I know about growing up in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. A country child\'s confident world is eaten away while the all-powerful adults are revealed as vulnerable, fearful, even desperate. This is history from within and it grips the heart. I\'m a rereader as much as a reader, and the classic that I would take with me is Colette\'s Le bl en herbe. This coming-of-age love triangle between a boy, a girl and an older woman is the essence of summer: tender, sensuous, poignant and without illusions.\nRobert Macfarlane\nTravel writer\nI\'m chairing this year\'s Man Booker prize jury, and we\'ve been on a novel a day for the past 100 days, and a novel every two days for the 100 before that. So fiction will certainly not be featuring as part of my summer reading (in fact, now I think about it, reading might not be featuring as part of my summer). But among the not-novels I\'ve been looking forward to having time to turn to, once the bulk of the Booker is done  we longlist in late July  are Tim Dee\'s forthcoming Four Fields, about grass, sunshine, life and the pastoral, and The View from Lazy Point by Carl Safina, the story of ""a natural year in an unnatural world"", written by an oceanographer who has been acclaimed in the US as Rachel Carson\'s successor. Both books, I anticipate, will relate dazzling close observation to the larger politics of the environment. Oh, and as part of the research for a book called Underland that I\'m slowly writing, about subterranea and the worlds beneath our feet, I\'ll also be reading Eyal Weizman\'s now-classic study Hollow Land: Israel\'s Architecture of Occupation (Verso).\nStuart Evers\nWriter\nBoth Evie Wyld\'s new novel, All the Birds, Singing, and James Scudamore\'s Wreaking have remote, rain-riven places at their heart  perfect, then, for any kind of squall or heatwave. I\'ll also be taking the first of the Carrigan and Miller novels, A Dark Redemption, by the UK\'s most important, underrated crime novelist, Stav Sherez, as well as the much vaunted web thriller Kiss Me First by Lottie Moggach. The Walk by Robert Walser is my ""classic author I\'ve never read"" inclusion for the year, accompanied by Jane Jacob\'s The Death and Life of Great American Cities as my non-fiction choice.\nAlexander McCall Smith\nNovelist\nPeter Davidson, an art historian, has written a remarkable and unusual book, Distance and Memory, which is a collection of essays about place and the effect of place. I have started this book but want to make it last the summer. It is a sustained prose poem, very moving in its effect. As for novels, I shall be reading James Robertson\'s Professor of Truth, a controversial fictionalisation of the Lockerbie issue that has haunted the Scottish legal system for some time. Robertson is a very great novelist. And then there is Rosemary Goring\'s After Flodden, another real treat.\nAli Smith\nNovelist\nI\'m looking forward to Bernardine Evaristo\'s new novel, Mr Loverman, out in August. It\'s the story of Barry, Antiguan-born Hackney local hero/antihero, who, it turns out, has been living a secret gay life (especially secret from his wife and kids) for decades. I\'m a fan of Evaristo, who can take any old trail and make it blaze. This novel looks full of explosive life and mischief. I\'m also reading all I can find of the 20th-century Italian writer Giorgio Bassani. Bassani was Jewish; he survived imprisonment and escaped the fate of so many of his fellow Jewish Ferrarese inhabitants. He spent the postwar decades using fiction to work at the knots of politics, passion and betrayal that formed the psyche of the town he knew inside out. I recently reread his novels, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis and The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles, in powerful new translations by the poet Jamie McKendrick; these sent me back to his other books published in the 1960s and 70s, which I\'ll read in the knowledge and the pleasurable hope that at some point there\'ll surely be McKendrick versions of these too. Bassani began as a poet, and McKendrick\'s redelivery of this taut uncompromising fiction reveals resonance and generosity.\nJustin Cartwright\nNovelist\nThe Accursed by the prolific Joyce Carol Oates is apparently a gothic novel but turns out, I am told, to be a subtle novel about fiction. WG Sebald is a great hero of mine; his work is utterly beguiling, and I can\'t wait to read the latest, A Place in the Country, a collection of his essays. As for Animal Farm, I have never really wanted to read it after reading Down and Out in Paris and London, and wondering how bad that could have been with a trust fund to call on. But I am aware that Animal Farm has pierced the consciousness of the world to a very deep level, so this summer I am going to read it. And I do like pigs.\nHari Kunzru\nNovelist\nIn fiction, I\'m looking forward to reading the reissue of Antonio Tabucchi\'s novel of fascist Portugal, Pereira Maintains, to Javier Maras\'s latest, The Infatuations, and to Barley Patch by the overlooked Australian master, Gerald Murnane. I\'ll also be packing Simon Critchley and Jamieson Webster\'s Stay, Illusion!, in which the husband and wife philosopher/psychoanalyst team dive deep into Hamlet, and William Dalrymple\'s account of Britain\'s first (but not last) Afghan disaster, Return of a King.\nCraig Taylor\nJournalist and playwright\nThis summer, I\'ll be so deep into Canadian fiction I\'ll practically be living in Moose Factory or Moose Jaw. There comes a point when people, and by people I mean me, need to play catch-up with the literature of their homeland, so Morley Callaghan and Margaret Laurence await, and also Gabrielle Roy and Madeleine Thien. I can\'t wait to read Leanne Simpson\'s collection of short stories Islands of Decolonial Love, The Victoria System by Eric Reinhardt and also a book made for anyone who cares about cities: Mark Binelli\'s The Last Days of Detroit.\nKamila Shamsie\nNovelist\nThis summer, as every summer for the past decade, I plan to read Middlemarch for the first time. I feel more confident that I\'ll get around to the more recently published books on my list (possibly because I actually own copies of them): Claire Messud\'s The Woman Upstairs, Patrick Flanery\'s Fallen Land, and the always brilliant Ali Smith\'s collection of lectures, Artful.\nRachel Cooke\nObserver writer\nI can\'t get on with my Kindle, but I will use it for reading Meg Wolitzer\'s fat new novel, The Interestings, which tells the story of six friends down the decades following their first meeting as teenagers in the summer that Nixon resigns. In paperback, I\'ll be taking Virago Modern Classics\' new edition, with an introduction by Barbara Trapido, of Barbara Comyns\'s 1947 novel, Sisters By a River, an autobiographical tale with a wild gothic streak about five girls\' struggle to bring themselves up. Comyns is brilliant, and if you haven\'t read her, you should. My non-fiction is going to be Careless People by Sarah Churchwell. Looks juicy, to say the least.\nAli Shaw\nNovelist\nFor the past few years, when the weather\'s grown hotter, I\'ve ended up reading about snow. This year, I\'m about to start Yasunari Kawabata\'s Snow Country, which has been described as haiku in prose and seems like a novel to return to over and over. I shan\'t get as far afield as Japan this summer but I will be taking Holloway to Dorset. It\'s a short and atmospherically illustrated book about that county\'s sunken paths, joint-authored by Robert Macfarlane, Stanley Donwood and Dan Richards. I\'m going to find one such holloway and sit in its tunnel of branches until I\'ve finished reading.\nColin Thubron\nTravel writer\nHolidays routinely promise more reading time than ever happens, but I shall take with me Gavin Francis\'s Empire Antarctica, which records 14 months among king penguins in the beauty of the west Antarctic. AndOn the Map by Simon Garfield offers a subtle study of how maps shaped us and vice versa. Finally, I hope to tackle David Foster Wallace\'s enormous and extraordinary novel Infinite Jest, a masterpiece (it is said) of comic seriousness.\nKate Kellaway\nObserver writer\nI have a pile of books in waiting. They involve truancy  or a departure from the run of the mill. The new edition of Wild Swimming by Daniel Start could not be more beckoning, identifying every British puddle and lake worth swimming in. Jane Robins\'s The Curious Habits of Doctor Adams is a true story that has had blood-curdlingly good reviews. It is about a 1950s GP who bumped off widows with barbiturates (one to keep you alert on the beach). And I have never read Chekhov\'s letters. I expect them to be as good as  perhaps comparable to  Keats\'s letters.\nWendy Cope\nPoet\nI will be spending a month in Stratford-upon-Avon as a writer in residence, so I\'ll be brushing up my Shakespeare  reading plays I\'ve never got around to, such as Timon of Athens, and rereading others. My copy of Charles Moore\'s Margaret Thatcher biography has just arrived. I know I\'ll enjoy that because Moore is such a good writer. However, it is a very big, heavy book  more suitable for reading at home than for travelling with. Other new books I\'m keen to read include A Delicate Truth by John Le Carr, Fleur Adcock\'s new collection of poems, Glass Wings, and Fifty Years in Time and Space: A Short History of Dr Who by Frank Danes.\nElizabeth Day\nObserver writer\nThe best holiday reading experience I had all year was taking Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie away with me over Easter. It is a brilliant novel: epic in scope, personal in resonance and with lots to say. This summer, I\'m hugely looking forward to Viv Groskop\'s I Laughed, I Cried. I\'m a big fan of Groskop\'s journalism and the premise of this memoir  an amateur does 100 standup gigs in 100 days  is too intriguing to resist. I\'ve had an untouched copy of Moby-Dick on my bedside table for so long it\'s now getting embarrassing. I seem to have read an awful lot of novels inspired by it (the latest being The Art of Fielding by Chad Harbach) so this might be the year that I take the plunge.\nJulie Myerson\nNovelist\nI can\'t wait to reread my friend Mark Lawson\'s astonishingly expansive, hilarious and heartbreakingly dark new novel, The Deaths, which is to be published in September; I was treated to a sneak preview last year but now want to savour it as slowly as possible. I\'m also going to take Kate Worsley\'s gender-switching She Rises, partly because I love historical novels but also because she\'s the latest graduate to be published from my husband\'s creative writing MA at City University. Meanwhile, Halldr Laxness\'s 1948 classic, The Atom Station, has been on my pile for a while, pressed on me by my daughter who has fantastically good taste and is fast becoming much better read than me.\nPhilip French\nObserver film critic\nThe weighty volume in my holiday book bag is Careless People, Sarah Churchwell\'s enticing survey of ""Murder, Mayhem and the Invention of The Great Gatsby"". It has a striking cover based on Fitzgerald\'s 1925 bookplate. My fiction choice is John le Carr\'s A Delicate Truth. I\'ll be reading it in Sweden where he should have been shortlisted long ago for the Nobel prize. I\'ve plucked from my shelves a classic I\'ve long been intending to read: Hunger, the Norwegian Nobel prize-winner Knut Hamsun\'s 1890 novel, of which I\'ve too often said: ""No, but I\'ve seen the movie.""\nSam Jordison\nWriter\nI\'ll be taking Elvis Died for Somebody\'s Sins But Not Mine by Mick Farren. Farren wrote about everything from Johnny Cash to Richard Nixon to ebola and did it all with rage and humour, not to mention unusual precision. I\'ll interweave that with JW Ironmonger\'s The Coincidence Authority, hoping it will be as surprising and touching as last year\'s Notable Brain of Maximilian Ponder. But I expect most of my time will be spent basking in Sodom and Gomorrah, book four of Proust\'s In Search of Lost Time. I started reading the first book earlier this year and there\'s been no turning back. I know it\'s hardly news that Proust is good  but no one had told me how much fun he is too: how funny, how bitchy and how gloriously naughty. Getting through those millions of words isn\'t a challenge. It\'s a delight.\nAlex Preston\nAuthor and journalist\nTo Spain, in August, I\'ll be taking Evie Wyld\'s second novel, All the Birds, Singing. I adored her first, After the Fire, and I\'m looking forward to lingering over this one on a terrace, with a glass of wine, in those precious hours after the kids are in bed. A stray comment in an interview with Gnter Grass put me on to Wolfgang Koeppen\'s Death in Rome. It\'s an extraordinary novel, beautifully translated by Michael Hoffmann. I\'m looking forward to reading the others in his ""trilogy of failure""  Pigeons on the Grass and The Hothouse. Finally, I\'ll pack a proof copy of Anthony McGowan\'s Hello Darkness. His novels  ostensibly ""young adult""  are brilliant, dark and very funny.\nSara Wheeler\nTravel writer and biographer\nI am learning Russian this year so all books point east. Much looking forward to Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking, a memoir by American journalist Anya von Bremzen. Also Joseph Frank\'s monumental biography of Dostoevsky  though I will have to pay excess baggage, as the condensed version comes in at 1,000 pages. Then it\'s Chekhov\'s short stories in a bilingual edition, starting, naturally, with ""The Lady With the Dog"". A daunting prospect, but what\'s the point in learning Russian if you can\'t battle through Chekhov in the original?\nTalitha Stevenson\nAuthor and journalist\nI\'ll be rereading George Saunders\'s collection of short stories, Tenth of December, this summer  and reading all his other work for the first time. I\'ll also read James Salter\'s new novel, All That is. I was lucky enough to see Salter talk at the South Bank this May and he was still fiery with wit and compassion at the age of 88. I\'ll also be rereading Marilynne Robinson\'s novel Home, which I have been afraid to look at again for three years because she knows how to break my heart.\nRobert McCrum\nObserver writer\nJoanna Kavenna is one of the recent ""Best of Young British"" Granta selections, and her satire, Come to the Edge, a Cold Comfort Farm for the new millennium, makes perfect summer reading: pointed, perverse, perceptive  and highly entertaining. Lara Feigel attracted very good notices for her study of literary London during the Blitz, The Love-charm of Bombs. Admirers of Elizabeth Bowen, Rose Macaulay and Graham Greene will marvel at the extraordinary world they inhabited during the war. An ideal book for that wet afternoon by the beach. Finally, the classic I\'d always take to add a bit of texture and shade to summer\'s bliss is Elizabeth Taylor\'s masterpiece, Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont. Taylor is one of Austen\'s heirs  a wonderful comic miniaturist who deserves never to be forgotten.\nMary Beard\nClassicist\nJenn Ashworth\'s The Friday Gospels will make a nicely unsettling poolside read. Brought up in a Mormon family, here she turns her fictional talents to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, both its dark and its hilarious sides. Dark in a different sense is Dante\'s Divine Comedy. Clive James\'s new translation is wonderfully unstuffy and injects fresh life back into the poem. For those of us making for Greece, the original 2nd-century guidebook, Pausanias\'s Guide to Greece (in Peter Levi\'s Penguin Classics translation), offers a useful antidote to the Rough Guide and tells you what tourists 2,000 years ago got told.\nLara Feigel\nAuthor and academic\nFor me, this is a summer of Martha Gellhorn and Ernest Hemingway, so I\'ll be packing Hemingway\'s Boat by Paul Hendrickson. Hemingway loved his fishing boat more enduringly than any of his wives, so making it the focus of a biography is an inspired idea. Gellhorn is now best known for her incisive journalism but she was also a wonderful novelist. I\'ll take Liana (1944), which is set on a Caribbean island and so may make appropriate beach reading. In the evenings, I\'ll frighten myself with Stephen Romer\'s French Decadent Tales. These are grizzly, erotic stories of macabre maniacs, elegantly translated by Romer.\nOwen Jones\nColumnist\nIt\'s no cheery beach read, but I\'ll be reading up on the human impact of austerity across Europe in The Body Economic by David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu, exposing how people\'s health has suffered because of savage cuts in countries such as Greece. I\'m looking forward to getting stuck in to Mike Power\'s Drugs 2.0, a clever and witty take on how drug deals have gone from shady alleyways to the click of a mouse. Finally, I\'ve shamefully never read the late Iain Banks\'s notoriously dark but riveting classic The Wasp Factory: I can\'t wait to rectify that.\nStephanie Merritt\nNovelist\nI\'m looking forward to reading Camilla Lackberg\'s new psychological thriller, The Lost Boy. I\'ve raced through the rest of her series; she creates smart crime plots with plenty of twists and I like the way she weaves in the personal lives of her detectives. I\'m also taking The Trip to Echo Spring: Why Writers Drink by Olivia Laing, an exploration of the relationship between creativity and alcohol. I\'m also determined to finish The Great Gatsby. It\'s one of those classics I always pretend I\'ve read but actually haven\'t, and the film has inspired me to return to it.\nWilliam Dalrymple\nTravel writer\nI\'m taking three books with me on holiday, all by friends, that I should have read by now. Mohsin Hamid\'s How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia has had rave reviews, as has Taiye Selasi\'s Ghana Must Go, and I\'m really looking forward to getting into both beside a Tuscan pool. A classic I\'m also taking with me is Steve Coll\'s Ghost Wars, about US meddling in Afghanistan prior to 9/11, which I\'ve somehow never read. I\'m weighing up the pros and cons of writing a history of the Indo-Pak conflict since 1947 and no one knows the Afpak repercussions of that rivalry better than Steve.\nLucy Lethbridge\nHistorian\nI\'ll be reading And Man Created God by Selina O\'Grady, for perspective; Edith Pearlman\'s collection of short stories, Binocular Vision, for surprises; and David Kynaston\'s Modernity Britain so I can read about Terylene and Fray Bentos tinned steak and kidney pie under an alien sun.\nSalley Vickers\nNovelist\nI\'m packing Mr Darwin\'s Gardener by Kristina Carlson  a quiet novel (my favourite kind) set in Downe, the village where Darwin spent his last years. The book is Finnish but the translation, by a mother-and-daughter team, Emily and Fleur Jeremiah, is terrific and the author\'s grasp of England circa 1880 is utterly convincing.

A giraffe at Denver Zoo,0,1,4,6.1837286949157715,"[{'title': 'Bracing for her future: Baby giraffe fitted with orthotic', 'date': '2022-05-13T20:44:36', 'content': 'ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP)  Over the past three decades Ara Mirzaian has fitted braces for everyone from Paralympians to children with scoliosis. But Msituni was a patient like none other  a newborn giraffe.\nThe calf was born Feb. 1 at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, north of San Diego, with her front limb bending the wrong way. Safari park staff feared she could die if they didnt immediately correct the condition, which could prevent her from nursing and walking around the habitat.\nBut they had no experience with fitting a baby giraffe in a brace. That proved especially challenging given she was a 5-foot-10-inch-tall (178-centimeter) newborn and growing taller every day. So, they reached out to experts in orthotics at the Hanger Clinic, where Mirzaian landed his very first animal patient.\nIt was pretty surreal when I first heard about it, Mirzaian told The Associated Press this week during a tour to meet Msituni, who was strutting alongside the other giraffes with no troubles. Of course, all I did was go online and study giraffes for like 24/7 until we got out here.\nZoos increasingly are turning to medical professionals who treat people to find solutions for ailing animals. The collaboration has been especially helpful in the field of prosthetics and orthotics. Earlier this year, ZooTampa in Florida teamed up with similar experts to successfully replace the beak of a cancer-stricken great hornbill bird with a 3D-printed prosthetic.\nThe Hanger team in California had fit orthotics for a cyclist and kayaker who both went on to win medals at the 2016 Paralympics in Brazil and customized a brace for a marathoner with multiple sclerosis who raced in seven continents.\nAnd in 2006, a Hanger team in Florida created a prosthetic for a bottlenose dolphin that had lost its tail after becoming tangled in ropes from a crab trap. Their story inspired the 2011 movie Dolphin Tale.\nBut this was a definite learning curve for all, including Matt Kinney, a senior veterinarian for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in charge of Msitunis case.\nWe commonly put on casts and bandages and stuff. But something that extensive, like this brace that she was provided, thats something we really had to turn to our human (medicine) colleagues for, Kinney said.\nMsituni suffered from hyperextended carpi  wrist joint bones in giraffes front limbs, which are more like arms. As she overcompensated, the second front limb started to hyperextend as well. Her back leg joints also were weak but were able to be corrected with specialized hoof extenders.\nAnd given that she weighed more than 100 pounds (55 kilos) at birth, the abnormality was already taking its toll on her joints and bones.\nWhile the custom braces were being built, Kinney first bought post-surgery knee braces at Target that he cut up and re-sewed, but they kept slipping off. Then Msituni wore medical grade braces for humans that were modified for her long legs. But eventually Msituni broke one.\nFor the custom braces to work, they would need to have a range of motion but be durable, so Hanger worked with a company that makes horse braces.\nUsing cast moldings of the giraffes legs, it took eight days to make the carbon graphite braces that featured the animals distinct pattern of crooked spots to match her fur.\nWe put on the giraffe pattern just to make it fun, Mirzaian said. We do this with kids all the time. They get to pick super-heroes, or their favorite team and we imprint it on their bracing. So why not do it with a giraffe?\nIn the end, Msituni only needed one brace. The other leg corrected itself with the medical grade brace.\nWhen they put her under to fit the custom brace, Mirzaian was so moved by the animals beauty, he gave her a hug.\nIt was just amazing seeing such a big, beautiful creature just laying there in front of me, he said.\nAfter 10 days in the custom brace, the problem was corrected.\nAll told, she was in braces for 39 days from the day she was born. She stayed in the animal hospital the entire time. After that, she was slowly introduced to her mom and others in the herd. Her mom never took her back, but another female giraffe has adopted her, so to speak, and she now runs along like the other giraffes.\nMirzaian hopes to hang up a picture of the baby giraffe in her patterned brace so the kids he treats will be inspired to wear theirs.\nIt was the coolest thing to see an animal like that walk in a brace, he said.

"Riding one Bird scooter along Venice Beach, while also transporting three others.",0,1,6,6.176012754440308,"[{'title': 'Are ride-share electric scooters the future of urban transport?', 'date': '2018-04-25T05:00:39', 'content': 'Electric share scooters have taken over Santa Monica, an affluent beachside city on the edge of Los Angeles, but as they swiftly spread across other cities in California and the US a backlash is already gathering force.\nDownload an app, scan a scooters barcode and away you go, zipping at up to 15mph to your destination. You leave the scooter on the pavement for the next rider.\nBird, a startup run by former Uber executives, launched the scooters in Santa Monica last September. Hundreds were deposited around the city overnight, the devices so ubiquitous people literally tripped over them.\nThey have thrilled, bemused and aggravated  feelings San Francisco, San Jose, Austin and Washington DC are now experiencing as scooters from Bird and two other startups, LimeBike and Spin, hit their streets, with dozens more cities due to receive them this year.\nA full-scale backlash is under way in San Francisco, where some scooters have been tossed into trash cans and lakes. The city attorney has threatened to impound scooters, calling them dangerous, unlawful and examples of tech arrogance. City hall is exploring ways to regulate the devices.\nWith a global market in their sights, the scooter startups are pushing back\nBird comes armed with $115m (80.3m) in investment funding and seems to take the Uber-esque, hard-charging stance on regulation that it is better to seek forgiveness than permission. A tangle with Santa Monica officials earned a criminal complaint and hefty fine.\nThe demand is huge. Were looking to reach more than 50 markets this year and eventually have Birds all over the world, says Stephen Schnell, the companys vice president of operations, noting that Britain is on the companys radar. We try to pick cities that have bicycle lane infrastructure.\nSchnell, like Birds CEO Travis VanderZanden, previously worked at Lyft and Uber.\nRide sharing companies are shaking up urban transport but many commuters still have the last mile problem: a distance too far to walk and too short to drive, says Schnell. This is a way to get people out of their vehicles.\nMarlon Boarnet, an urban planning and spatial analysis professor at the University of Southern California, says dockless scooters can facilitate short trips while being light on the environment and using minimal space.\nTraditionally we view this as walking or bicycling, but the concept can and should be extended to light and small powered vehicles like electric scooters. One could also include in this set small neighborhood electric vehicles or electric motor assisted bicycles. We should expand our idea of what an acceptable short trip vehicle is.\nBoarnet hopes the companies and city authorities can resolve issues such as where the scooters are left. When clumped in the middle of a pavement scooters can seem more nuisance clutter than transport revolution.\nThe boom and bust of dockless bicycles in several markets  exemplified by a picture of a bicycle graveyard in China  act as a cautionary tale.\nThe Guardian scooted around Santa Monica for a week to try them out. The longest journey was from the citys downtown to Birds headquarters in Venice, three miles away. It took 17 minutes and cost $3.55  a $1 base fee plus 15 cents per minute.\nThe experience was positive. Scooters were easy to find with the apps map pinpointing devices left by trees, parking meters, benches and doorways.\nOnce youve scanned and unlocked the barcode with your phone theres a childlike glee in kicking off with your foot, pushing the handlebars throttle button and gliding down the street.\nNot encased in a shell of metal and glass, you feel connected to your surroundings  both hands are needed to steer so it is difficult to text or fiddle with your phone.\nTootling down Main Street, the most striking impression was the response of pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders and motorists: in most cases there wasnt one. In September the scooters were a novelty and drew stares. Now theyre part of the streetscape and barely remarked upon  except by some tourists who gawk and take pictures.\nBird reports quick adoption; there are more than 50,000 regular riders in and around Santa Monica, and riders in San Francisco notched up more than 60,000 miles in just 17 days. Its kind of amazing, says Schnell.\nWhats amazing, say critics, is the irresponsibility of the scooter companies and many of their riders.\nFew wear helmets in Santa Monica. It is common to see children riding scooters, two people on one scooter, parked scooters cluttering sidewalks and moving scooters scattering pedestrians on sidewalks. San Francisco residents have joined Santa Monicans in venting on social media.\nRiders are supposed to be licensed drivers, helmeted and are meant to ride on streets, preferably in bicycle lanes. Users need a drivers licence to download the app and upon request Bird sends free helmets. Still, improper use abounds. According to a city spokesperson, so far Santa Monica has recorded 11 accidents, some serious, 328 citations and 694 traffic stops.\nIrked that Bird launched with little or no warning, city authorities filed a criminal complaint over lack of business licences and vendor permits. Both sides settled in February, with Bird promising to seek the licences and to pay more than $300,000 in fines.\nEven though they got off to a rocky start we didnt move to kick them out because based on our values were really committed to this new model of mobility, says Anuj Gupta, Santa Monicas deputy city manager.\nThere has been no detectable impact on car congestion but scooters are now part of the transport mix, he says. We honestly understand and share in the excitement about these devices.\nBut theres another concern. If Bird and rival startups plant scooters on every block wont people have even less incentive to walk and exercise?\nYou mean WALL-E world, says Schnell, referencing the Pixar film in which future humans become obese gluttons ensconced in padded floating arm chairs.

""You know now a murderer. I believe this. Its in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now they left.

And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is, without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.\nHarris said the diplomatic work that the administration does with Israeli leadership ""is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" which include the need for humanitarian aid, an end to the war, a deal to release the hostages and a cease-fire.\nAnd were not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" she said.\nPressed in a follow-up question about whether Netanyahu is listening to the U.S., the vice president said, The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.\nAsked whether the U.S. has a close ally in Netanyahu, Harris deflected, saying, I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.\nHarris vows to \'ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated\'\nand\nOn the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks, Harris said she is devastated by the loss and pain of the Israeli people and vowed to work toward ensuring that the threat Hamas poses is nonexistent.\nI will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas, Harris said in a statement.\nThe vice president also vowed to never stop fighting for the release of all hostages, reiterated her stance that Israel has a right to defend itself, and called for a cease-fire deal as she lamented the lives lost in Gaza in the past year.\nHamass terrorist attack on October 7 launched a war in Gaza,"" she said. ""I am heartbroken over the scale of death and destruction in Gaza over the past yeartens of thousands of lives lost, children fleeing for safety over and over again, mothers and fathers struggling to obtain food, water, and medicine. It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people.\nHarris said she believes that a diplomatic solution can be reached between Israel and Lebanon, which she said is only path to restore lasting calm that would allow residents on both sides to return home safely.\nIn a separate statement, Biden, who is holding an Oct. 7 remembrance ceremony at the White House this morning, said he and Harris remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist, and support Israels right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and Iran.

The clerks serve one-year terms and play a low-profile but crucial role in advising their bosses on which cases to take up and how to rule on them. They do research, help craft decisions and serve as sounding boards for the justices.\nIn the competition for students and prestige, law schools have worked to propel their students into clerk jobs.

"A woman walks her dog on a Paris bridge with during a nationwide confinement to counter the COVID-19 on April 7, 2020.",0,1,1,8.545433759689331,"[{'title': 'India coronavirus: More than 60 million people may have caught Covid-19, survey finds', 'date': '2020-09-30T05:22:48', 'content': 'New Delhi CNN \nMore than 63 million people in India may have contracted Covid-19, health authorities said on Tuesday  about 10 times higher than the official reported figures.\nA national survey of more than 29,000 people across 700 villages and wards found that about one in 15 people above the age of 10 had antibodies against the coronavirus, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The survey was conducted from mid-August to mid-September.\nAntibody tests, also known as serology tests, check for proteins called antibodies in the immune system, which indicate if someone has been exposed to the virus.\nOf the countrys 1.3 billion citizens, more than 966 million are aged 10 or above, according to the governments most recent census in 2011. If one in 15 people of this group have been infected with Covid-19, thats a total of 63.78 million people.\nAs of Wednesday, India has reported more than 6.1 million cases and 96,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\nThe survey suggests that for every one infection officially reported, there are actually 26 to 32 people infected who slip through the cracks, said Dr. Balram Bhargava, director of the medical council, at a news conference on Tuesday.\nThis falls in line with what many experts have warned for months  that Indias coronavirus crisis may be much more dire than official figures suggest.\nThere are numerous reasons for this: People simply arent getting tested enough. There are sometimes errors in reporting and registering cases. Changing government strategies can muddle the numbers and paint a misleading picture of the situation.\nThe government began rolling back restrictions in May after a months-long lockdown, with ministers turning their attention to reopening the economy and public services. But experts, including Bhargava, warn that its too soon to relax.\nSince a large proportion of the population is still susceptible, prevention fatigue has to be avoided, Bhargava said, adding that the risk of infection was highest in urban slums where millions live in crowded conditions, often with limited sanitation or running water.\nSlum residents had a seroprevalence  meaning they carried antibodies  of 15.6%, almost double the 8.2% detected in residents of non-slum urban areas. The figure drops in rural areas to 4.4%, according to the survey.\nThe survey shows how important it is for the Indian public to continue taking coronavirus precautions like social distancing and personal hygiene, said Bhargava on Tuesday  especially during Diwali, the festival of lights. The festival, which this year falls on November 14, is one of Indias biggest annual holidays.\nIn light of the upcoming festivities, in light of the winter season and mass gathering, containment strategies must be implemented by the states and the use of masks cannot be underlined more than after this seroprevalence survey, he warned. That is very, very essential.\nThe numbers dont show the full picture\nExperts have long suspected that the number of cases in India may be vastly underreported.\nRamanan Laxminarayan, a senior research scholar at Princeton University, predicted that the country may be undercounting infections by a factor of 50 to 100  meaning the true number could be upwards of 100 million.\nOne simple reason behind the discrepancy is insufficent testing. India has stepped up its testing, almost doubling the amount of tests conducted during the month of August  but it still lags far behind other major countries.\nOnly about 82 of every 100,000 people in India are being tested per day, according to Johns Hopkins University  compared to about 284 in the US and 329 in the United Kingdom.\nAll the other countries test two times, three times, 10 times what India is testing, community medicine specialist Dr. Hemant Shewade told CNN earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, Indias mortality rate of 1.6% looks much lower than other countries  compared to 2.9% in the US, 9.5% in the UK, and 11.5% in Italy, according to Johns Hopkins University. But coronavirus deaths, too, are likely being undercounted.\nEven when India isnt facing a pandemic, its underfunded public health infrastructure means that only 86% of deaths nationwide are even registered in government systems. And only 22% of all registered deaths get an official cause of death, certified by a doctor, Shewade said.\nAnd even if a coronavirus patient tested positive before dying, they might not be counted as a Covid-19 death if they had other preexisting conditions, such as diabetes or cancer, which could be recorded as the cause of death instead, he added.\nSome world leaders have pointed out the flaws in case reporting; US President Donald Trump brought up the topic during the presidential debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday night.\nWhen you talk about numbers, you dont know how many people died in China, you dont know how many people died in Russia, you dont know how many people died in India, he said.

Chinese soldiers stand guard as tourists visit the Badaling section of the Great Wall,0,1,4,7.788300037384033,"[{'title': 'Hiking the authentic Great Wall of China, without the crush', 'date': '2018-03-14T23:39:13', 'content': 'Tires crunch the gravel as our driver turns around and makes his way back down the narrow access road, leaving my fiance, his mother and me alone in front of an empty building. The air is cool and fresh, and a few white clouds move briskly across the blue sky. Beijing, with its more than 20 million inhabitants, gleaming skyscrapers and intermittent layer of smog, is a safe 50 miles to the south. All being well, well see the driver again in about four hours, at our pickup location.\nI check the WeChat message on my phone again. Behind [the building] theres a path uphill to the wall. Usually, a farmer can point you to it. Follow it up. There are no farmers to be seen on this bright November morning, but the path is there, and the valley swallows us up in minutes. Overhanging branches graze our jackets and backpacks, and dead leaves scatter underfoot. Something rustles in the undergrowth. A squirrel? This late in the year, the valley  which becomes lush and green with the arrival of spring  is brown and quiet.\nMy gaze drifts up from the uneven, rocky path to scan the tops of the hills. As we round another corner, the view clears and I see what Ive been searching for. A frisson of excitement runs through me. Standing high over us is a tower of the Great Wall of China.\nRelishing an insiders food tour of Beijing\nThe Great Wall is a bit of a misnomer, as there was never one single structure that spanned modern-day China. Rather, a number of large defensive walls were built by various rulers from as early as the 5th century B.C. through the mid-17th century, often hundreds of miles apart and with little relationship to one another.\nAdvertisement\nYet one of those sections, the Ming Wall, is recognized all over the world. Built during the Ming dynasty (1368  1644) it stretches from a fort at Jiayuguan near the Gobi Desert in the west, all the way past Beijing to the sea at Shanhaiguan in the east. By some estimates, it is 5,500 miles long.\nUnlike other sections that were made of rammed earth and straw, most of the Ming Wall around Beijing is built on a foundation of cut stone and bricks held together with an early  but very strong  mortar made of lime and sticky rice glue. With crenelated ramparts and tall towers, it is the Great Wall of my imagination.\nAs visitors, in China for only about a week, we are lucky to be here at all. Less than half an hour ago, we drove past a large parking lot filled with tour buses at Mutianyu, a popular section of the Great Wall. Dozens of bus drivers stood around chatting beside their giant vehicles, waiting for their groups to return. Sites like that, and Badaling, some 40 miles to the west, are immensely in demand among day trippers, receiving millions of visitors per year, but more closely resemble theme parks than ancient sites. All over China, sections of the wall are being rebuilt by unregulated private contractors who are keen to capitalize on tourist dollars but show little interest in historically accurate restorations. Foot by foot, the largest man-made structure in the world is being paved over, funded by visitors who funnel through them every year, largely unaware of what they are missing.\nAdvertisement\nWe might have been among them if not for a fortuitous encounter with a family friend, Richard Fairbrother, over lunch two days prior. A longtime Beijing resident, he is also a keen amateur explorer and is writing a field guide about hiking on the wild, unrestored sections of the wall  his particular area of interest. Minutes after we parted, my phone lit up with messages recommending an interesting hike in the Moya Shike Natural Scenic Area near the village of Dazhenyu, including drop-off and pickup locations and the kind of familiar directions that only locals can give.\nHow to see Beijing in three days\nGuided by ribbons\nWith the tower looming over us, we climb and climb, following the meandering, narrow trail and a line of faded red ribbons. Tied to tree branches at regular intervals, they are markers left by hikers who have come before us. After 45 minutes or so of fairly steep climbing, the trail ends at a brick wall half hidden by bushes, and we clamber through an opening in the side. Were here. From beneath our feet, the wall races away in both directions, zigging and zagging along the ridge like an irregular heartbeat, punctuated by square towers. The wall itself is at once awe-inspiring and smaller than I expected. At this point, it is approximately 10 feet wide, but greatly overgrown and filled with low shrubs, leaf litter and crumbling bricks, leaving only a narrow path snaking through the debris. Low battlements, about waist height, protect us from the drop on either side.\nI consult my phone again. Richards instructions are clear. Follow the wall uphill . . . the downward way finishes at a dead end.\nAdvertisement\nUphill we go, pushing back branches and steadying ourselves against the walls. The red ribbons continue to pop up on branches. Although thoughtful, they are doubly unnecessary now. Not only could we not get lost here, but there is plenty of evidence that we are on the right path  the floor around us is littered with soda cans, plastic bottles and empty cigarette packets, their labels faded from the rain and sun. Later, I learn that this trash was probably left by domestic visitors from other parts of the country. Theories abound: Perhaps it represents a lack of environmental education, or simply not realizing that unlike in the cities  where teams of cleaners move through the streets like clockwork  out here in the wilderness things lie where they fall. Whatever the cause, it is a baffling, and concerning, sight.\nThe path loops up and down, and is often very steep, requiring us to lunge up steps and grab onto branches and bricks for support. The three of us spread out, taking the path at our own pace, and sometimes I stop, squeeze between the notches in the rampart and stick my head out to peer down at the trees below.\nDue to our latish start, lunch time coincides with our arrival at the first tower. It is not easy to get to  sections of it have collapsed, blocking the entrance and forcing us to climb up and over, right onto the roof. We sit with our legs dangling over the side, quietly munching on our sandwiches and making little piles out of mandarin orange peels. A startlingly clear melody floats past on the breeze, and we spot a white bus in the valley far below, radio blaring.\nIn centuries past, this spot would have been an ideal place to spy an invading army. The air is fresh and free of smog, and we can see distant purplish hills for miles in every direction.\nAdvertisement\nFollow the sun.\nWe collect our citrus peels and clamber down over the rubble. As we progress westward, each tower offers a more beautiful view than the last, their arched doorways and narrow windows framing the spectacular landscape beyond them. We stop more often just to take in the view as the early afternoon shadows grow, casting the folds of the mountain range in sharp relief. The wind blows cooler now, and we zip up our jackets under our chins. We are still alone.\nThen, it just stops. From our vantage point inside a tower, we see the wall crest a hill and then appear to dissolve into nothingness. I shrug off my backpack and creep forward, edging closer until I can see over the crest and down to where the wall becomes treacherously degraded. A brick wall has been built to block the path, and beyond that there is a very steep drop. Stones litter the valley floor, as if scattered by some giant wave.\nAdvertisement\nFor today, our hike is done. In a few minutes, well begin the steep, scrabbling descent to Dazhenyu, where our driver should be waiting for us. In four hours, weve covered approximately four miles  a minuscule fraction of the wall and all that this vast country has to offer. Yet I can already see what draws Richard back here over and over. The lonely wild wall is full of beauty and secrets, and every yard hiked feels like the most wonderful discovery.\nI lift my gaze. Further up the ridge is another tower, and the wall continues along in a thin, unbroken line far into the distance until it eventually disappears behind a hill and completely out of sight.\nHartley is a writer based in Paris.

"Patients at a small clinic in San Felix, Venezuela.",0,1,4,6.581424236297607,"[{'title': 'In Venezuela, more Covid patients are being treated at home', 'date': '2021-03-25T14:50:05', 'content': 'CARACAS, Venezuela  Chef Carlos Pez has a long and tough road ahead after a serious case of COVID-19 that required a constant supply of oxygen. He is showing improvement, but his health is still fragile.\nPez, however, didnt receive treatment at one of Venezuelas hospitals despite appallingly low oxygen saturation levels. He was treated at his home in the capital, Caracas, because it is not easy to find a bed at a public hospital these days  the outcome of a recent increase in coronavirus cases and chronic understaffing  and he was priced out of a private facility despite having health insurance.\nHe is one of a growing number of coronavirus patients who are choosing to be cared for by health care professionals at home during their illness, even if their cases warranted hospital stays.\nI dont know what I would have done, Pez, a grill master, said, referring to the home health service. The 55-year-old is still hooked to an oxygen concentrator and has difficulty speaking.\nThe South American country has recently seen a spike in COVID-19 cases, which the government has partially attributed to a virus variant that scientists believe originated in neighboring Brazil. The increase has pushed already struggling hospitals to see more patients than at any other time during the pandemic.\nVenezuela Vice President Delcy Rodrguez on Friday said the country was facing a second wave of infections, though she did not give hospitalization figures. On Sunday, Medicos Unidos de Venezuela, an organization established to protest the longstanding shortage of medical supplies in the countrys hospitals, warned that the capacity of intensive therapies, both in public and private centers, is insufficient for the number of patients who are being admitted in serious condition and require the support of a ventilator, which can only be provided in these units.\nThe government has reported more than 151,100 coronavirus infections and 1,493 deaths related to COVID-19 since the pandemic began. But the Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Venezuela has warned about the possibility of a significant underreporting of infected people due to poor diagnostic capacity, among other factors.\nPeople who seek care at private hospitals face bills that, in cases like Pezs, can exceed $50,000 for two weeks of in-patient care. That is unaffordable for most in an economically battered nation where workers earn an average of $2 per month.\nFees for doctors who provide in-home care can bring the cost of COVID-19 treatment to about half of that of a private clinic. The terms of payment are also negotiable.\nIn this country plagued by four-digit inflation and prices that are increasingly set in dollars instead of the local currency, most health insurers are unable to cover even the cost of routine lab tests or an appointment with an internal medicine specialist. Pezs family is raising money online to cover his mounting medical bills.\nDr. Leonardo Acosta and two other physicians began offering in-home services in May. Initially, Acosta said, their patients were people who did not want to go to the clinic, not even to be tested, out of fear that authorities  complying with President Nicols Maduros order that all patients be hospitalized  would go looking for them at their homes.\nAs time went on, Acosta said, he and his colleagues began to see a little more complicated patients. Then came those like Pez, whose condition included oxygen saturation levels that dipped below 50% and warranted a stay in the hospital. But hospitalization was not an option.\nWe had to support him here, Acosta said at the home of the Pez family. The chefs room still has several bulky pieces of medical equipment, including his oxygen concentrator. During the worst of Pezs illness, Acosta said his patient was hooked up to a non-invasive ventilator.\nThe in-home medical team consists of about 15 people, including three doctors who handle complicated cases, other physicians, medical students and nurses specialized in intensive care. They offer coronavirus testing and other lab work as well as imaging and respiratory therapy services. The team members take turns monitoring patients 24/7.\nVenezuelas former minister of health and member of the non-governmental organization Red Defendamos la Epidemiologa Nacional, Jos Felix Oletta, told The Associated Press that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients recover without the need for hospitalization. On average, he said, 17% of those infected have significant symptoms, and of those, only 2% require intensive care, so you should hospitalize only 2% of the total.\nIt is convenient to make rational use of limited resources in a country that does not have the capacity to respond, Oletta said. If you compulsively force everyone who is not symptomatic or is slightly symptomatic to occupy a bed, the day you need that bed you wont have one.\nMaduro last week ordered lockdowns in Caracas and other cities to stop the spread of a variant of the coronavirus known as P1. He acknowledged Sunday that the increase in infections is also related to the easing of curfews and other measures implemented earlier in the pandemic.\nMaduro said the countrys case rate last week increased from 21 per 100,000 people to 27 per 100,000 people.\nIn the last week, we have maintained an average of 739 new cases and 456 recovered per day, after months of staying even, he said, adding that at the same time, the occupation of hospital beds is growing, but he did not give other details.\nEven before the virus variant began spreading in Venezuela, independent physicians were inundated with a mix of coronavirus and general patients. Some went from a few patients to more than 30 and had to reject up to 300 requests for their services on a daily basis.\nMedical equipment suppliers also cannot keep up with demand. Acosta said oxygen concentrators are difficult to obtain and his team is working at maximum capacity.\nThe demand for people seeking care is very high, Acosta said.', 'description': 'In Venezuela, more of those sick with coronavirus are seeking treatment at home due to high healthcare costs and shortages in hospitals.', 'source_domain': 'www.nbcnews.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'San'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'Felix'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Venezuela'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.nbcnews.com'], 'dates': ['2021-03-25T14:50:05'], 'languages': ['']}",1

"A man dives into the water near Canary Wharf, London.",0,1,4,6.5045976638793945,"[{'title': 'It has lost its appeal: Canary Wharf faces an uncertain future', 'date': '2023-07-05T06:00:27', 'content': 'Its not happening. This is the blunt assessment of the success of efforts to turn Canary Wharf into a shopping and leisure destination. Mondays and Fridays are dead, says the frank shop worker. This shop used to take a fair bit before Covid but now everythings changed.\nIts a verdict that appears to be shared by other tenants in the vast east London financial hub. HSBCs decision to leave its tower of doom in the docklands and move back to the City of London after more than two decades has dealt a hammer blow to Canary Wharfs standing as a global financial centre.\nThe move has left onlookers examining landlord Canary Wharf Group (CWG)s plans to raise the appeal of the former wasteland, at a time when hybrid working has reduced the throng of office workers descending on the area each day.\nHSBC will ditch its 45-floor skyscraper at 8 Canada Square when the lease expires in 2027 and move to an office near St Pauls Cathedral thats roughly half the size, following in the footsteps of other companies such as the law firm Clifford Chance.\nThe decision says a lot about demand for office space post-pandemic, and the sterile perception of Canary Wharf that the developers management is desperately trying to shake off. It has added shops, bars and restaurants in recent years, landscaped the areas between its glass-and-steel towers and created a public art trail, which it says is Londons largest collection of outdoor public art. Over the summer, there are free events aimed at families such as open-air movie screenings and a music and theatre festival.\nOffice worker numbers have dwindled since the Covid pandemic, even though several US banks including JP Morgan have ordered their staff back to the office for all or most of the week. Other financial firms are more relaxed about working from home, such as Lloyds Banking Group. This means many staff only go into work between Tuesday and Thursday.\nWhile the City is also affected, Canary Wharf  owing to its less central location in a loop of the Thames known as the Isle of Dogs  has to work harder to attract firms and visitors. To reduce its reliance on financial services, it wants to build a life sciences hub, and is courting technology and media companies as well as charities.\nThe early vision\nSince Margaret Thatchers big bang financial reforms of the 1980s, east Londons docklands have been transformed from a wasteland with derelict warehouses into a cluster of gleaming skyscrapers teeming with bankers and lawyers. Canary Wharf takes its name from the quay where fruit and veg from the Canary Islands were unloaded.\nIn 1981, Thatchers government established the London Docklands Development Corporation to rebuild the area, and enlisted the Canadian property tycoon Paul Reichmann. By the time the first tower, the pyramid-topped One Canada Square, rose out of the docks in 1990, Thatcher had been ousted, and two years later the Canadian developer filed for bankruptcy.\nCWG, today owned by Canadas Brookfield Property Partners and the Qatar Investment Authority, later took up the baton and turned 52 hectares (128 acres) of wasteland into a financial hub. It has been built despite opposition from locals  the estate is in one of Londons poorest boroughs, Tower Hamlets.\nAn evening ghost town\nDespite CWGs repeated attempts to bring a buzz to the area throughout the week by introducing open water swimming, paddleboarding and go karting, some shops and food sellers still operate reduced hours or dont open at weekends.\nEvenings tend to be quiet too. The last hour is a bit strange when it gets to between 7pm and 8pm, says one shop worker at an upmarket beauty brand. She adds that quite a few people only come into the shop because they are lost and want directions. The meandering, underground mall built around Canary Wharf station feels pretty soulless. More outdoor space would help, she says.\nHer colleague chips in: If you dont work here, then why would you come here? There are shopping centres all over London.\nMianika Sikabofori, senior sales assistant at shirt retailer Charles Tyrwitt, is more upbeat. The store really picked up this summer. At the weekend, we get groups of people who are looking to buy something for an event, like Ascot, she says.\nIn recent months, Churchs Shoes and Ted Baker have shut stores in the mall, replaced by other brands.\nCWG insists that 97% of its shops are occupied by tenants, but declines to disclose the occupancy rate for its offices.\nAbout 15.5% of Canary Wharf offices are empty, compared with 11% in the City, according to commercial real estate firm CoStar. In the West End it is even lower at 6.6%, according to property firm Savills.\nWith the rise of hybrid working, and more automation on the trading floor, Barclays and Citigroup are both shrinking from two buildings to one in Canary Wharf.\nThe future of Credit Suisses Canary Wharf offices are also in doubt as job cuts loom after its takeover by UBS. The law firm Clifford Chance decided last autumn to return to the Square Mile to an office half the size of its current one in Canary Wharf. It will be paying 77 a square foot in rent, which is thought to be similar to HSBCs new rent.\nCWG is trying to lure firms with cheaper rents  which average about 50 per sq ft, compared with 72.50 per sq ft in the City. But firms like HSBC can easily afford to pay a higher rate if they are downsizing at the same time.\nIts all about the vibrancy of an area that outweighs even the prime amenities that are on offer in a good building, says Marie Dormeuil, European office analyst at Green Street Advisors.\nIts a recurring theme. The City or a more central location within London fare slightly better than Canary Wharf. It still has quite a few things on offer and its not a dead area, but from an office perspective, it has certainly lost its appeal and what made it.\nShe says Canary Wharf  equivalent to almost a 10th of Londons 22m square metre office market  is most at risk in the capital, as its office buildings typically offer large floorplates, mainly let to banking, legal and tech-oriented tenants that have now embraced hybrid working.\nThe credit agency Moodys cut CWGs rating to junk last month, citing a difficult operating and funding environment.\nTravel into the docklands\nCommuter levels at Canary Wharf tube station are at 70% of pre-pandemic levels at about 325,000 exits a week. But the areas transport links have vastly improved with the arrival of the Elizabeth line, which whizzes people from Bond Street in central London to Canary Wharf in about 15 minutes.\nThe Elizabeth line station in Canary Wharf is seeing 148,000 exits a week and the combined figures show that the number of people travelling to Canary Wharf is now higher than it was before the pandemic, according to Transport for London.\nLondon City airport has also bounced back and is back in profit. About 3 million passengers used the airport in 2022 but the number remained below the 5.1 million recorded in 2019.\nWhat next?\nWhile three-quarters of the estate is offices and nearly a fifth shops and restaurants, CWG is also building some apartment blocks, comprising 3,900 homes. More than 3,500 people are living on the estate, where there were none three years ago.\nCanary Wharf has been compared to the La Dfense business district in the west of Paris, which has a similar office vacancy rate of 16%, but Dormeuil says: Canary Wharf is much more thriving than La Dfense. It has a lot more to offer to its local residents.\nFinally, CWG has ambitions to build a major life sciences cluster to rival those in Oxford and Cambridge. It has managed to attract the UK health regulator and Genomics England, while the European Medicines Agency departed following Brexit. A 750,000 sq ft commercial laboratory building, supposedly the largest in Europe, is also in the works and the developer hopes to lure small biotech firms. CWG will hope the health specialists can help to breathe new life into the area.\nThis article was amended on 5 and 10 July 2023 to remove an incorrect statement in a quote that no one lives in La Dfense in Paris, and to locate the business district in the west of the city, rather than the north.', 'description': 'Londons docklands financial district is facing the loss of major firms such as HSBC and its owners are having to innovate to stem the exodus', 'source_domain': 'www.theguardian.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Canary'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': 'W'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##harf'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'London'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.theguardian.com'], 'dates': ['2023-07-05T06:00:27'], 'languages': ['']}",1

The story they tell goes as follows: you vote; the majority party takes office; you leave it to govern on your behalf for the next four or five years. If you dont like one of its policies, your representative will put their own ambitions, party loyalty and pressure from powerful interests aside to ensure your voice is heard.\nWe can trust the government to spend our money wisely; to defend minorities against more powerful or larger groups; to resist undemocratic forces such as oligarchs, the media they control and corporate lobby groups. We can trust it to ensure everyones needs are met; workers are not exploited; our neighbourhoods and quality of life are not sacrificed to corporate profits. We can trust it not to abuse the political process; not to wage wars of aggression against other nations; not to break the law. There cannot be many people who have lived in the UK  or many other nations  for the past few years and still believe this fairytale.\nWe have seen what happens if we leave politics to governments. Fairly elected or not, they will, without effective public pressure, abuse their power. They will change political rules to favour their party, subordinate public interest to that of corporations and billionaires, beat up vulnerable groups, sacrifice our common future to expediency and impose ever more oppressive laws to bind us.\nTrust in governments destroys democracy, which survives only through constant challenge. It requires endless disruption of the cosy relationship between our representatives and powerful forces: the billionaire press, plutocrats, political donors, friends in high places. What challenge and disruption mean, above all, is protest.\nProtest is not, as governments like ours seek to portray it, a political luxury. It is the bedrock of democracy. Without it, few of the democratic rights we enjoy would exist: the universal franchise; civil rights; equality before the law; legal same-sex relationships; progressive taxation; fair conditions of employment; public services and a social safety net. Even the weekend is the result of protest action: strikes by garment workers in the US. A government that cannot tolerate protest is a government that cannot tolerate democracy.\nSuch governments are becoming a global norm. In the UK, two policing bills in quick succession seek to shut down all effective forms of protest. They enable the police to stop almost any demonstration on the grounds that it is causing serious disruption, a concept so loose, it could include any kind of noise. They would ban chaining yourself to railings or other fixtures, and interfering with key national infrastructure, which could mean almost anything. They expand police stop and search powers, an effective deterrent to civic action by black and brown people, who are disproportionately targeted by them. They can even ban named people from engaging in any protest, on grounds that appear entirely arbitrary. These are dictators powers.\nIn the US, state legislatures have been undermining the federal right to protest, empowering the police to use catch-all offences such as trespass or disrupting the peace to break up demonstrations and make arrests. Proposed laws in states such as Oklahoma and New Hampshire have sought to grant immunity to drivers who run over protesters, or vigilantes who shoot them. In Russia, a new law against discrediting the armed forces has been used to prosecute dissenters engaging in actions as mild as writing no to war in the snow. Similar draconian laws are being imposed by governments in many other nations.\nWhy do governments want to ban protest? Because its effective. Why do they want us to accept their narrow vision of democracy? Because it makes our power ineffective.\nThe protests governments seek to ban broaden the scope of democracy. They permit us to challenge malfeasance and resist oppressive policy. They are the motor of political change, and the early warning system that draws attention to the crucial issues governments tend to neglect. The extraordinary people in these images understand this  from suffragettes picketing the White House in 1917 to Patsy Stevenson being manhandled by police at last years Sarah Everard vigil; from relatives of those killed at Amritsar in India in 1919 to those taking to the streets after George Floyds murder in the US.\nAlmost everything of importance is disintegrating fast: ecosystems, the health system, standards in public life, equality, human rights, terms of employment. Its happening while elections come and go, representatives speak solemnly in parliament or Congress, earnest letters are written and polite petitions presented. None of this is enough to save us from planetary and democratic collapse. Business as usual is a threat to life on Earth. Disrupting it is the greatest civic duty of all.\nThey will continue to demonise us as a threat to the democracy we seek to protect. They will continue to arrest us and raise the penalties for being a good citizen. And we will continue to come out in defiance, as people have done for centuries, even when facing state violence and repression. Everything we value depends on it.\nPussy Riot play Red Square, 2012\nPussy Riot was formed in October 2011, because we didnt want Putin to stay in power for ever, and we felt that if we didnt get rid of him, he would bring a great deal of pain to our country, says Nadya Tolokonnikova, a founding member of the Russian protest group-cum-punk band.\nOn 20 January 2012, eight members of Pussy Riot climbed on to the platform in front of St Basils Cathedral in Moscows Red Square and staged a guerrilla performance of their song Putin Zassal (Putin Has Pissed Himself). Operating anonymously at the time, the women wore brightly coloured ski masks as they sang and set off smoke bombs.\nWe had religiously rehearsed the whole of January, Tolokonnikova recalls. Coming to the square many times in advance; trying to calculate when there would be fewer police cars; getting climbing equipment for our shoes because the podium was covered in ice; discussing in detail what to do if we were detained.\nImmediately after the performance, the women were detained. We spent eight hours at the police station and were let go. Exhausted. But happy.\nThat day is remembered as Pussy Riots big breakthrough. After their next performance  held inside Moscows Cathedral of Christ the Saviour  three members, including Tolokonnikova, were prosecuted for hooliganism, and the veil of anonymity was lifted. Yet through multiple arrests and jail terms  and as Putin has tightened his grip on power  the group remains determined to give voice to the resistance. In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, the stakes have only grown. Protest activity is becoming increasingly dangerous in Russia, Tolokonnikova says. You face 15 years in jail for calling a war a war, not a special military operation. And still, people protest every day. Not because they want to be heroes: because they cant lie to themselves. GS\nPolice dogs attack civil rights demonstrators in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963\nIn early 1963, Martin Luther King Jr described Birmingham as probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. He and other civil rights leaders organised a campaign of nonviolent protests, placing students at the centre of the movement. Eugene Bull Connor, the citys commissioner of public safety and a staunch segregationist, directed the use of fire hoses and police dogs to quell the demonstrations. Charles Moores images of a dog attacking a young man on 3 May 1963 drew national attention to the Birmingham movement  and led to Connors ousting from office. GS\nThe lady in red at Gezi Park, 2013\nAround three million people took part in the wave of protests against the government that swept Turkey in the summer of 2013. It began with a small, peaceful protest on 28 May against the planned demolition and redevelopment of Taksim Gezi Park in Istanbul; police then attempted to disperse protesters using teargas and water cannon. This image of activist and academic Ceyda Sungur being teargassed quickly became an emblem for the movement. Images of the lady in red, as she was dubbed, appeared on posters and online graphics, galvanising protests across the country. GS\nBarbara Krugers vision goes global, 2020\nThe artwork Untitled (Your Body is a Battleground) was originally produced by Barbara Kruger as a poster urging people to attend the March for Womens Lives in Washington DC in April 1989. The demonstration was organised in protest against the Republican administrations attempts to overturn Roe v Wade that year. Formerly an editorial designer at Cond Nast, Kruger knew how to create a memorable image: I was able to use the fluencies I developed with pictures and words and transform them into my own engagements as an artist.\nToday, Krugers rallying cry for bodily autonomy continues to appear around the world. In this photograph, a Polish version of the poster, first produced in 1991, is shown plastered on a street in Szczecin in 2020. Abortion laws in Poland are among the most restrictive in Europe. Language has power. And the velocity and accessibility of that power is dependent on its readability, Kruger says of her decision to translate the text on the poster in Poland.\nHow does it feel to see her artwork still circulating so widely  especially in the wake of the renewed assault on reproductive freedoms around the world? It is tragic that the war against womens bodies, against their power and agency, and against the notion of a multiplicity of genders, is continuing in the most brutal of ways, Kruger says. GS\nRosa Parks takes her seat on the bus, 1956\nThis was taken on 21 December 1956, the day of the desegregation of the public transportation system in Montgomery, Alabama. More than 12 months earlier, Rosa Parks had been arrested for refusing to give up her seat for a white man, sparking the 382-day Montgomery bus boycott  the first large-scale demonstration against segregation in the US. The white man in this photo was not a random passenger but veteran UPI reporter Nicholas Chriss: the shot was staged by an uncredited photographer to illustrate this important victory. GS\nTiananmen Square, 1989: a young boy \nThis was the only moment in my career when I instinctively knew it was going to be just fine  that I had a great shot, Dario Mitidieri says. It was the Italian-born photojournalists final evening in Beijing, where he had flown to document the protests in the square. He had a return ticket to the UK the following morning.\nWhen he first arrived in the Chinese capital, Mitidieri recalls that the atmosphere had been quite joyful. It was like a massive student party, they were dancing in the streets at night, singing Chinese opera. We knew there were secret police filming everywhere but there was no sense of danger, he says. But then soldiers began assembling around the square. Mitidieris photo of a young boy sitting on the shoulders of a relative, above a sea of helmets, was shot at around 6pm on 3 June 1989, only a couple of hours before the massacre began. In order to get the best angle, he climbed on to the seat of a nearby bicycle, held upright by two student protesters.\nThe image would become a potent symbol of the innocence of the protesters who were violently oppressed when the troops were sent in that night. Mitidieri, who never learned the name of the boy in the photo, thinks of his record of the events at Tiananmen Square as a true example of the value of the work photojournalists do. He compares it to the current situation in Ukraine: We have this propaganda coming from the Russian government, but the rest of the world is very well aware of whats going on because of the presence of photographers and journalists documenting it all, risking their lives. GS\n and Tank Man\nThis photograph was taken by Stuart Franklin, a British photographer, on 5 June 1989, the day after the Tiananmen Square massacre, in which its believed as many as 10,000 pro-democracy protesters in Beijing were killed by troops sent in to quash the demonstrations. A lone protester, dubbed Tank Man, stood blocking the path of a column of tanks leaving the square. Footage of the incident was smuggled out of China, with the still-unidentified man instantly becoming an icon in the western world. As Franklin put it: Here was a modern-day version of David and Goliath. GS\nThe self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc, 1963\nNo news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one, John F Kennedy said about this image of an elderly Buddhist monk taking his own life, on 11 June 1963, in protest against the persecution of Buddhists by South Vietnams largely Catholic government. American photojournalist Malcolm Browne won a Pulitzer prize for his documentation of the shocking event. GS\nResistance at the Gaza border, 2018\nAed Abu Amro was among tens of thousands of Palestinians taking part in weekly protests at the Gaza border from 2018-19. Among their demands were an end to the blockade and right of return for Palestinian refugees. This image  by Gazan photographer Mustafa Hassona  of the young man with the flag of Palestine and a slingshot was seen around the world, drawing comparisons to Eugne Delacroixs 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People. Abu Amro was later shot and injured by Israeli troops at another protest. GS\nEmma Sulkowicz carries a mattress, 2014\nThere arent many student art projects that receive as much attention as Emma Sulkowiczs final-year thesis at Columbia University in New York. For Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight), Sulkowicz vowed to carry a mattress wherever they went on campus until the school agreed to expel a fellow student whom they had accused of rape. The performance continued until their graduation  and became a potent symbol of protest against rape culture in universities. That image, Hillary Clinton said in 2015, should haunt all of us. GS\nThe March on Washington, 1963\nOn 28 August 1963, a quarter of a million people marched on the US capital to protest for civil rights in America; this was the day that Martin Luther King Jr made his famous I have a dream speech. Danny Lyon was a staff photographer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and close friends with the activist and later congressman John Lewis, who helped organise the march. I spent the night prior to the march sleeping on the floor of John Lewiss small hotel room, he remembers. It was very hot, and very sunny, just the worst light to make photographs.\nThis image, of a group of high-school students singing at the march, later became a symbol of the civil rights struggle, and was used as a poster by the SNCC throughout the 60s. The unusual angle was a result of Lyon trying to get other nearby photographers out of the frame: I fell to my knees to shoot, and shot up to the sky.\nThe picture has had a powerful afterlife. In 2020, as the city of Louisville banned street protests in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, Black Lives Matter artist-activists led by Darius Dennis painted a vast, 45ft-high mural of the photograph on the wall of a government building in downtown Louisville. For Dennis, the image represented the spirit of protest history; by displaying it publicly at a moment when protest was banned, his team wanted to make these moments of black and brown and Indigenous people more accessible than they are in our schools. FB\nAftermath of the Amritsar massacre, 1919\nIn 1919 a peaceful crowd gathered in an open area called Jallianwala Bagh, in the Indian city of Amritsar, to protest against the British authorities arrest of pro-independence leaders Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal. The crowd was surrounded by troops from the British Indian army who, under orders from the acting brigadier general, Reginald Dyer, began to fire on the protesters, killing many hundreds of people  estimates suggest 370 to 1,000.\nA young photographer called Narayan Vinayak Virkar arrived to document the aftermath. These images are very different from the rest of his work, which largely consists of sumptuous portraits of nationalist leaders such as Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose; instead Virkar took a series of sparse crime scene pictures, with the bullet holes from the shooting circled in white chalk. Relatives of those killed point to the holes.\nFor art historian Christopher Pinney, Virkars work is a very significant moment in the history of photography. In the 19th century it had been used as a tool of scientific or political authority, but in the 20th century, photographers such as Virkar began to use it to challenge the power structures around them. Virkar undoubtedly saw his images as involved in a fightback against colonial oppression, Pinney says. He sees a link between Virkar and the citizen journalists of today who document wrongdoing by the powerful. FB\nThe Friday of Victory on Tahrir Square, 2011\nThis was taken from my friends balcony, recalls Egyptian-Lebanese photographer Lara Baladi. During the initial 18-day uprising in Egypt in 2011, when thousands gathered to protest against President Hosni Mubaraks authoritarian rule, the flat overlooking Tahrir Square became a meeting place for journalists and activists, always filled with people working, texting, tweeting.\nPreviously Baladi had been documenting the movement down below, but on 18 February, she wanted to see the view from above. It was the week after Mubarak had been toppled, so that day was named the Friday of Victory. It was a beautiful sunny day, she remembers. As she watched people in the square celebrate, two young men emerged next to her; they had just bought a massive bale of fabric at the textile market, basically 100 metres of the Egyptian flag. Taking hold of either side of the fabric, they threw it down. In no time it unrolled all the way into the crowd. As soon as it reached the square, people caught it. Minutes later it was stretched out and knotted to other pieces of fabric, and Baladi took the picture: It all happened very fast.\nLooking back, for her, this photograph marks a turning point in the uprising  the victory, the height of the revolution, before reality kicked in and the social divisions and nuances began to surface.\nThe events of the last 10 years have confirmed for her that change does not begin with the uprising. What happens before and after it is just as important, if not more. Revolution is a continuous process. FB\nIrish women walk for abortion rights, 2016\nIn May 2018, two-thirds of Irish voters opted to legalise abortion in a referendum pro-choice activists had long called for. A defining image of the campaign was of a march two years earlier outside the Irish embassy in London. We wanted to make a visual statement that might reach decision-makers at home, says Hannah Little (front). We decided 77 women should walk silently with suitcases towards the embassy, the number of women then travelling from Ireland to Britain every week to access terminations.\nPeople who question if a protest accomplishes anything dont see the butterfly effect: strangers meet, swap details, start a campaign. Thats exactly what happened here. The London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign met with MPs, launched legal cases, raised money for pro-choice causes, held protests and mobilised Irish voters abroad. I dont see myself in this photo at all. Oddly, I never have, Little says. I see young women who are angry and ready to take power back. It resonates with people because we look unstoppable. And we were! GS\nMay Day in Mexico, 1926\nItalian photographer Tina Modotti became famous for the images she produced in Mexico in the 1920s of working-class life and political organising. This image of a workers May Day parade in 1926 was reprinted multiple times within her lifetime and reflects her stylistic mixture of art photography and reportage. In 1930 she was arrested and given an ultimatum: she could either cease her communist activities or leave Mexico. She chose to leave. FB\nBlack power on the Olympic podium, 1968\nYou could have heard a frog piss on cotton, John Carlos (right) said in an interview with Gary Younge in 2012 of the moment he and Tommie Smith raised their fists in a black power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, during the medal ceremony for the 200m race. Theres something awful about hearing 50,000 people go silent. The silence was followed by a torrent of racial abuse and though their protest made them famous around the world, it had grave repercussions for both men, whose careers suffered. Carlos had no regrets, however: I had a moral obligation to step up. Morality was a far greater force than the rules and regulations they had. FB\nMLK and the March on Montgomery, 1965\nOn 25 March 1965, Martin Luther King Jr led thousands of civil rights protesters to the capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, after a five-day march that started in Selma; 25,000 people joined in across the 80km march, demanding the right to vote. Moneta Sleet Jr covered the landmark event as a photojournalist for Ebony magazine. FB\nThe Handmaids go to Washington, 2017\nIs the dystopian future envisioned in The Handmaids Tale, Margaret Atwoods novel turned TV show about a theocratic regime that strips women of their basic freedoms, already here? In recent years, the red cloaks and white bonnets worn by the handmaids of Gilead have become a familiar feature at protests on womens issues around the world. The group of women standing outside the US Capitol in this image from 2017 were demonstrating against a bill that sought to defund the sexual healthcare provider Planned Parenthood. GS\nBlessing the protesters at Euromaidan, 2014\nMaidan was the first act in a great historical movement, wrote Jrme Sessini prophetically in 2019. It was just the beginning of a coming confrontation on a much larger scale. The Magnum photographer covered the protests in central Kyiv that led to the ousting of the pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. Sessini was present during a period of extreme violence, when snipers killed at least 70 people; he captured the events with a series of extraordinarily dramatic and disturbing images. In this photograph, an Orthodox priest blesses the protesters on a barricade on 20 February 2014. FB\nThe aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, 2020\nAssociated Press photographer Julio Cortez captured this image just before midnight on 28 May 2020, the third day of protests after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. With its charged symbolism  the United States Flag Code says a flag should never be flown upside-down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property  the photograph conveys the deep sense of anger and injustice that would go on to fuel a mass movement of anti-racism protests across the globe. GS\nAfter the raid on Stonewall, 1969\nIn the early hours of 28 June 1969, a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York, prompted a spontaneous outburst of resistance that lasted for six days and was a watershed moment for LGBTQ+ rights. This photograph of young rioters gathered outside the boarded-up inn after the raid, shot by Fred W McDarrah for the Village Voice newspaper, captures the celebratory atmosphere that prevailed as gay and trans people refused to submit to state-sponsored oppression. The first gay pride march was held a year later to commemorate the event. GS\nStanding Rock v the Dakota Access Pipeline, 2016\nFrom April 2016, members of the Standing Rock and other Native American communities began to protest against construction of a pipeline in North Dakota, on the basis that it would affect local water supplies and cross sacred native lands. Barack Obamas administration halted construction, but Donald Trump would later reverse this decision. The pipeline remains in operation today. FB\nThai rubber duck protests, 2020\nIn November 2020, images of Thai pro-democracy protesters using inflatable rubber ducks to shield themselves from police water cannon went viral. They had originally been bought for protesters to float down the Chao Phraya River near Bangkoks parliament, but after the images were publicised, they became an unlikely symbol of the protest. FB\nProtest, Tokyo, 1969\nThis enigmatic image by the Japanese photographer Shomei Tomatsu presents a blurry figure caught in the act of throwing a stone in a protest against the Vietnam war. Tomatsu, whose subjects had included the vast changes taking place in postwar Japan, as well as the lingering traumas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was known for formal experimentation and unusual compositions, which inspired a whole generation of photographers in Japan. FB\nThe Soweto Young Lions student uprising, 1976\nOn 16 June 1976, thousands of black schoolchildren from the township of Soweto in Johannesburg, South Africa, took to the streets, protesting against a decree that all black schools must teach in Afrikaans  what Desmond Tutu called the language of the oppressor. The children were initially hesitant to be photographed  the Johannesburg-born photographer Peter Magubane convinced them, he later recalled, by telling them struggle without documentation is not struggle. The images would prove vital when coverage of the brutal police response  at least 176 people were killed  began to spread around the world, triggering mass outrage and firing up the anti- apartheid movement. GS\nJapans students and farmers v a new airport, 1971\nIn 1960s Japan, a coalition of thousands of leftwing student activists and farmers came together to wage a years-long campaign against the construction of a new international airport in a rural area 40 miles east of Tokyo. The biggest clash at the Narita international airport construction site erupted in September 1971, when 5,000 police were sent in to expropriate the land. The airport finally opened in 1978, after many delays. GS\nThe first Earth Day, 1970\nOn the first Earth Day, held in cities across the US on 22 April 1970 to support environmental protection, an estimated 20 million people took to the streets for clean-ups, marches and performances. This photo, of student Peter Hallerman, became an emblem of the modern green movement that was born that day. GS\nSoviet tanks roll into Prague, 1968\nThe Prague spring began on 5 January 1968, when Alexander Dubek took over the Czechoslovakian Communist party from his Stalinist predecessor; he introduced reforms that distanced his party from Moscow and promised socialism with a human face. Seven months later, Soviet tanks invaded and Dubek was eventually deposed. Josef Koudelka took about 5,000 photographs that week documenting acts of resistance by civilians but his identity was kept anonymous to prevent reprisals. After smuggling his film abroad, Koudelka fled the country, revealing himself to be the Prague Photographer only following the death of his father in 1984. GS\n#Notabugsplat, 2014\nA group of artist-activists laid out a vast image of a child in a Pakistani field to pique the conscience of US drone operators who watched the border with Afghanistan from above. The portrait is by Noor Behram, who worked in North Waziristan, an area targeted by drone strikes. The girl pictured lost both her parents to one in 2010. FB\nThe woman with the handbag, 1985\nA small neo-Nazi rally in the Swedish city of Vxj made worldwide news when this image of a woman striking a skinhead with her handbag began to circulate. Danuta Danielsson, a 38-year-old Jewish woman whose mother had survived the Holocaust, hijacked the demonstration by the Nordic Realm party on 13 April 1985, in an impulsive counterprotest that has since been memorialised in multiple statues. GS\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezs dress, 2021\nThe Met Gala in New York is known for attracting outlandish outfits and wealthy guests, with tickets reportedly costing around $35,000. In 2021, the Democratic congresswoman caused controversy with her gown bearing the message Tax the Rich emblazoned across the back, created by the designer and activist Aurora James. Critics charged her with hypocrisy; she maintained it was worthwhile because it created a conversation about taxing the rich in front of the very people who lobby against it. FB\nColombians vogue for change, 2021\nMass protests broke out in Colombia on 28 April last year in response to proposed government reforms, including increased taxes and an overhaul of the healthcare system. Lasting six weeks, the protests were met with violent crackdowns resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. But amid the repression, one image of joyful resilience stood out: the moment when three activists ascended the steps of the National Capitol in Bogot and starting vogueing.\nWe decided to protest because, as LGBTQI+ people, all the government reforms affect us much more, says Piisciis (pictured centre), a non-binary activist who created the music for the performance and invited fellow voguers Axid Ebony and Nova Ebony to collaborate on the steps. There is very little representation at these marches, so I wanted to open this dialogue.\nThe trio found themselves dancing metres away from the Esmad, Colombias notorious riot police. At that moment, I saw a lot of fear in Nova and Axids eyes; I also felt it, Piisciis says. Everything went well, but it could have been catastrophic. The dancers continued for a few minutes, cheered on by fellow protesters. Initially, the police seemed unsure what to do, but then, It turned into chaos: there were explosives, stones, weapons, and we had to run. The impact of the protest for the queer community in Colombia was, Piisciis says, epic. It was a moment of empowerment, strength and representation. If in the future there are history books, surely well be in them. GS\nResistance at the Woolworth lunch counter, 1963\nIn the spring of 1963, a sit-in was organised by students and staff of Tougaloo College, at a Woolworth lunch counter in Jackson, Mississippi, which had a whites-only policy. Anne Moody, who went on to become a famous author, is seated to the right, with student Joan Trumpauer and professor John Hunter Gray. Over the course of a few hours, an increasingly rowdy white mob pulled the hair of the women, dumping mustard and condiments over them, and attacked Gray, cutting his face and neck with brass knuckles and broken glass. Gray later recalled the atmosphere as a lavish display of unbridled hatred. FB\nA defiant menorah, 1931\nRachel and Rabbi Dr Akiva Posner were a Jewish couple with three children, living in Kiel, Germany, in the early 1930s. As part of Hanukkah celebrations, the menorah must be prominently displayed; but it can be hidden during a time of persecution. Rachel documented the moment  just over a year before Hitler took power  when the rabbi defiantly lit their menorah in the window, facing a building decked with Nazi flags. The Posners fled Germany two years later. FB\nPrams in Lviv, 2022\nOn 18 March 2022, 23 days into Russias war on Ukraine, 109 empty buggies were laid out in a square in Lviv, each representing a child who had been killed. Today the official estimate stands at more than 300. FB\nJan Rose Kasmir plants a flower in a bayonet to protest against the Vietnam war, 1967\nJan Rose Kasmir, 17, holds a chrysanthemum before a row of bayonet-wielding soldiers. This shot was taken by the Magnum photographer Marc Riboud on 21 October 1967 at the March on the Pentagon, a rally in Washington DC attended by 100,000 anti-war protesters. It would become the defining image of that movement. The soldiers, Kasmir later said, were just as much a victim of the war machine as anyone else. GS\nA woman slows down Seouls riot police, 2015\nGetty photographer Chung caught the moment a brave woman sat in front of riot police to protect a larger group of protesters, during anti-government protests in Seoul on 24 April 2015. FB\nHong Kong umbrella movement, 2019\nDuring the pro-democracy protests that took place in Hong Kong in 2014, many protesters used umbrellas to defend themselves from pepper spray. After journalists referred to the demonstrators as the umbrella movement, umbrellas quickly became a powerful symbol of the independence movement, carried by protesters to signal their allegiance and also used in art installations and countless memes. FB\nAlaa Salah becomes a symbol of a new Sudan, 2019\nWe were seeking freedom, and we were seeking our dreams, and we were seeking a new Sudan, recalls artist and musician Lana H Haroun of the 2019 revolution. Initially, forces loyal to president Omar al-Bashir had cracked down violently on protesters. But then some members of the army began to defend them, creating a safe space outside the presidential palace. People travelled from all over Sudan to be there.\nEvery day I was there, capturing photos, Haroun recalls. It felt like history itself. One day, she noticed people rushing towards a figure addressing the crowd, a 22-year-old called Alaa Salah. Haroun took four photos, and shared the best one online. It went viral, first on social media, then in newspapers around the world. A lot of things happened after that. Previously it had felt as if there was very little global coverage of what was going on in Sudan, but after Harouns picture it suddenly felt as if everybody in the world was focusing on what is going on in Sudan.\nWomen played a powerful and visible role in the protests; for Haroun, the picture was a strong message that women can lead. Salah went on to speak at the UN and was a Nobel peace prize contender. FB\nWords of protest across the world\nSanitation workers strike in Memphis, 1968\nThis famous chapter of the civil rights movement was captured by African American photojournalist (later revealed to be an FBI informant) Ernest C Withers. On 28 March  just days before his assassination  Martin Luther King Jr arrived in Memphis to lead a march in support of the citys 1,300 striking sanitation workers. Spurred by the deaths of two garbage collectors due to malfunctioning equipment, the strikers were calling for higher pay and safer working conditions for the citys Black employees. Their slogan was a simple but effective assertion of dignity: I am a man. GS\nThe royals in Jamaica, 2022\nPrince William and Kate Middleton made an ill-fated visit to the Caribbean earlier this year, where they were met by protesters calling for reparations, an official apology and the cutting of ties with the British monarchy. Around the time of the visit, Jamaica confirmed its plan to begin removing the Queen as sovereign. FB\nGreta Thunberg goes on strike, 2018\nToday, Greta Thunberg is one of the most famous living activists on the planet. But nobody knew who she was when, on 20 August 2018, the 15-year-old set up camp outside the Swedish parliament and declared that she would not attend school until after the general elections the following month. Her goal was simple: to force action on the climate crisis. The situation we are in is very dire and it seemed like no one was doing anything and someone needs to do something, she recalls. I thought, if this doesnt work, then Im going to try something else until I find something that works. I had no idea it was going to take off like it did.\nThe School Strike for Climate quickly became a global movement, with children around the world organising walk-outs. The following year, at the UN climate action summit in New York, Thunberg condemned world leaders for their failure to effect any meaningful change. It was like a very weird movie that was way too unrealistic and cliched to be any good, Thunberg says of the seismic public response. But its also quite hopeful, because it shows that the most unexpected things can happen in a very short amount of time.\nOn why young people have played such a significant role in climate protests, Thunberg says: It feels like our natural state of mind is to rebel. We dont use the excuse that its always been this way. But also its children who will live in this world, experience the consequences much more. Its closer to home.\nAfter taking a year-long break from education to focus on climate activism, Thunberg is about to enter her final year of school and continues her protest by skipping classes every Friday. Looking at the photo from her original demonstration, she says she still has the banner, but now keeps it at home to avoid rain damage. The bright yellow raincoat, which she borrowed from her dad, is also still around  Its still his, but I still steal it, she jokes. And if she could say anything to the girl in that image, what would it be? I would probably say: start crocheting and knitting earlier, because its really fun and it keeps you focused, she says with a laugh. But thats probably not the answer you want! GS\nA Russian woman stands up for Ukraine, 2022\nIn a country where protest is brutally oppressed, the bravery of Russians who publicly oppose the war in Ukraine has not gone unnoticed. The 76-year-old artist and activist Yelena Osipova became the face of the anti-war movement after footage of her arrest by police in St Petersburg on 2 March was seen around the world. In this image, the woman dubbed the grandmother for peace is holding her handmade protest banners while a crowd of supporters can be glimpsed in the background. GS\nSuffragettes at the White House, 1917\nOn 10 January 1917, a dozen suffragists gathered silently at the gates of the White House, becoming the first group to picket the presidential residence. Dubbed the Silent Sentinels, they held up banners calling on President Woodrow Wilson to support a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. Two thousand protesters joined the picket, which continued until 4 June 1919, when the 19th amendment was eventually passed. Many were arrested and jailed for their involvement  reports of the prisoners mistreatment played a key role in garnering wider public support for womens suffrage. GS\nArlen Siu and a Sandinista funeral in Nicaragua, 1978\nWhen Susan Meiselas arrived in Nicaragua in June 1978, she had no idea that a popular insurrection was about to erupt. The American photographer stayed in the country for 13 months, documenting the uprising of the FSLN, popularly known as the Sandinistas, against the US-backed Somoza dictatorship. The world didnt know much about what was happening in Nicaragua, Meiselas says. It was a time when we were not seeing images  which is unimaginable now.\nMeiselas felt compelled to witness the events as they unfolded. This image depicts a funeral procession in Jinotepe for recently assassinated student leaders. The protesters are holding up a large photograph of Arlen Siu, a singer and Sandinista who had been killed by the National Guard three years earlier. Siu went on to become a revolutionary icon.\nMeiselas attributes the impact of her photograph in part to the contrast between the monochromatic portrait of Siu and the vivid colour of the surrounding scene. There was a lot of criticism at that time of working in colour  very few newspapers published colour, she recalls.\nToday, of course, almost everything is shot in colour and Meiselas, who is president of the Magnum Foundation, is widely recognised for her work. But she doesnt see the plaudits as solely for her. Of the long afterlife of the image of protesters in Jinotepe, she says: Now Arlen Siu has more of a profile. I think of it as her getting her honour. GS\nBlack Muslims stand up to police violence, 1963\nGordon Parks was the first African American staff photographer employed by Life magazine. This image from a protest in Harlem in 1963  spurred by the police shooting of seven unarmed black men outside a Nation of Islam mosque in Los Angeles the previous year  is part of his series documenting the black Muslim movement. Parks was assigned the story after several white journalists failed to gain access to the groups leaders. GS\nThese images are a snapshot of a rich global history of resistance.

"Felix Tshisekedi, a largely untested candidate, received more than seven million votes, according to results released by the Electoral Commission.",0,1,4,6.743285655975342,"[{'title': 'He will bring light into our darkness: DR Congo pins hope on a new leader', 'date': '2018-12-15T20:23:00', 'content': 'The Avenue Salongo is the Champs-lyses of Mbuji-Mayi, residents say. The comparison is an optimistic one. There is little that unites this strip of pitted tarmac, with its pair of faltering streetlights and sweltering central African humidity, with the famously beautiful Parisian boulevard  other than the French language spoken on both.\nThe Avenue Salongos only hotel is the Metropole, where paunchy political fixers drink strong beer in a salon bar furnished with much smoked glass and heavy fake leather furniture. Opposite is a row of diamond dealers, where local artisanal diggers sell stones scrabbled from red earth in makeshift mines among the verdant hills around the city. An understocked pharmacy, a restaurant selling grilled offal and the Couture de la Paix dress shop complete the scene.\nLast week, however, the DRCs third-largest city enjoyed a day that was one of the most exciting anyone could remember for a long time, triggered by the arrival of one of the main opposition candidates in forthcoming presidential elections.\nThis vast resource-rich country  with its population of 80 million spread over an area the size of western Europe  will go to the polls in seven days. The DRC has never known a peaceful transition of power since its hasty independence from Belgium in 1960. The fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 triggered a civil war in which four million died. Joseph Kabila, the president, has been in power since his father, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.\nThe forthcoming polls have inspired both great trepidation  and great hope. We need a change, a big change. We live so badly, said Angela, 21, a student. Angela, who did not want to give her family name for fear of attracting ennuis or troubles, had walked across the city to the Avenue Salongo very early in the morning to greet opposition candidate Flix Tshisekedi. She had first tried to reach the airport on the outskirts of Mbuji-Mayi, but had turned back when police clashed with stone-throwing youths and a teenager was shot dead. I am best here. I will wait for him. He is our president. He is worth it, Angela said.\nMbuji-Mayi is the capital of the province of Kasai-Oriental. Tshisekedi is from the region, and this is his stronghold. His father, Etienne Tshisekedi, was a famous opposition leader under Mobutu. He died last year and his son has inherited his party, and with it a slim chance of winning power.\nNo one doubts the problems any president of the DRC will face. The country is one of the poorest in the world, wracked by war and disease. Inequality is off the charts with wealthy grosses legumes  or fat cats  driving Jaguars over the potholes of streets in the capital Kinshasa. Huge sums earned from mining contracts disappearing into the pockets of those close to le pouvoir, or power elite.\nIn the east, scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines and an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. In the Kasais  the name given to the provinces around Mbuji-Mayi  the grass is yet to grow over the mass graves left by a conflict between rebels and government forces in which thousands died between 2016 and last summer.\nAcross the country, aid agencies estimate that 4.3 million people are displaced. In the rolling valleys around Mbuji-Maya, half the children may be malnourished. Cholera has killed hundreds since 2016.\nThe countrys manifold problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago. Only under fierce pressure from neighbouring and nearby powers, particularly Angola and South Africa, did he agree not to stand in the coming polls, even if he is constitutionally barred from serving three consecutive terms. He was very unhappy, very angry and resentful, said one diplomat close to the negotiations with Kabila. Instead, the ruling coalition picked the little-known interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, as its candidate.\nIn Kinshasa, aides insisted Shadary was his own man. Our candidate was chosen by a broad cross section of Congolese society. He has his own programme and personality, said a spokesperson.\nThe opposition has been weakened by internal arguments and the exclusion by the electoral commission of two political heavyweights: Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord, and Mose Katumbi, a popular tycoon.\nCritics say Tshisekedi is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. His father was a man of the country. The son is very limited, said Valentin Mubake, a former secretary-general of Tshisekedis Union for Democracy and Social Progress.\nIf the campaign has been largely peaceful so far, the opposition and some observers fear massive fraud. In Mbuji-Mayi few have much faith in the system. Here they are going to vote 100% for Tshisekedi but we know that if he got 100% in the elections, they would never let us win. Any time we raise our heads, they force us back down again, said Dr Marie-Albert Tshizemba, a senior health official.\nMany are worried about new electronic voting machines. Not only are these impractical in the harsh conditions of the DRC, where electricity is unreliable or non-existent, but they could be vulnerable to manipulation, opposition leaders claim.\nLast week 7,000 voting machines in Kinshasa were destroyed in a suspected arson attack, stoking fears of interference. A result seen as illegitimate by much of the population might lead to protests, violence and even war. Imagine what would happen if there was chaos here. Imagine Libya but on the scale of the Congo. Imagine what that would do to the region, to the continent, said Mubake.\nYet such fears did not dampen the enthusiasm for Tshisekedi in Mbuji-Mayi. Through the morning, despite the continuing reports of further delays to the candidates arrival, crowds continued to gather on the Avenue Salongo, singing in praise of their hero.\nBy early afternoon, hundreds of young people were running and singing in rhythm along the road. Some carried palm fronds. Armed police watched nonchalantly. Something has to change. Life is too hard. Theres no clean water, power. Most of us here dont have enough to eat. The prices are double what they were a year ago. We struggle, said Joseph Kabula, a trader who supports his wife and two small children by selling mobile phones he fetches from Kinshasa, 800 miles away.\nFinally, in the early evening, with the crowds now thick all along the Avenue Salongo, sirens are heard, music and cheering. The candidate is on his way. Sitting on the cab of an SUV, Tshisekedi is smiling, bespectacled, rotund, sweating. He waves and then is swept away among supporters surging down the road. He is going to save us. I know it. He is our saviour. He will bring light into our darkness, Angela says, when the noise and crowds have subsided.', 'description': 'In the sweltering heat of a provincial capital, we join the citizens desperate for next weeks election to bring a new dawn', 'source_domain': 'www.theguardian.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-PER', 'word': 'Felix'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': 'T'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': '##shi'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': '##se'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': '##ked'}, {'entity': 'I-PER', 'word': '##i'}, {'entity': 'B-ORG', 'word': 'Electoral'}, {'entity': 'I-ORG', 'word': 'Commission'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.theguardian.com'], 'dates': ['2018-12-15T20:23:00'], 'languages': ['']}",1

The association started offering it in 2018 without incident. But a recent online advertisement inviting applications attracted a harsh response from Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, a self-proclaimed devout Catholic and former army commander.\nIn a strongly worded statement Thursday night, Chiwenga claimed the scholarship was a direct challenge to the governments authority.\nOur schools and institutions of higher learning will not entertain applicants, let alone enroll persons associated with such alien, anti-life, un-African and un-Christian values which are being promoted and cultivated by, as well as practiced in decadent societies with whom we share no moral or cultural affinities, he said.\nGALZ has previously said the scholarship seeks to provide equal access to state universities for LGBTQ+ people who are often ostracized by their families and struggle to pay for higher education. It did not comment on the vice presidents statement.\nHowever, a coalition of human rights groups that GALZ belongs to said it demonstrated that sexual and gender minorities are endangered in Zimbabwe.\nWe are extremely concerned about the statement from the second-highest office in the land because it exhibits intolerance, especially taking into account that the advertisement opens young people to so many opportunities, Wilbert Mandinde, the programs coordinator at Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, told The Associated Press on Friday.\nLike many African countries, Zimbabwe has laws criminalizing homosexual activity. Sex between men carries a potential sentence of up to a year in prison, and the countrys constitution bans same-sex marriages.\nChiwenga said Zimbabwes anti-gay laws make any (scholarship) offers predicated on the same aberrations both unlawful and criminal, and a grave and gross affront on our national values and ethos as a Christian nation.\nHe said the government will not hesitate to take appropriate measures to enforce national laws, adding that young people should never be tempted to trade or sell their souls for such abominable and devilish offers.\nZimbabwe has a history of discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people. Former President Robert Mugabe, who ruled the southern African nation for 37 years, once described them as worse than dogs and pigs and unworthy of legal rights.\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power following a 2017 coup led by Chiwenga when he was still an army general, has been less publicly vocal in his anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. But Chiwengas threat to ban the scholarship highlights the continued hostility from authorities and sections of society, including influential religious groups, remains.\nIn December, Zimbabwes Catholic bishops, like many of their African counterparts, cautioned against the Pope Francis declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples, citing respect of the law of the land, our culture and for moral reasons.\nZimbabwe has in the past stopped public acts that may appear to demonstrate approval of gay people.\nIn 2021, a planned visit by a gay South African celebrity, Somizi Mhlongo, for the reopening of a trendy Zimbabwean restaurant was canceled after a Christian sect and members of the ruling ZANU-PF partys youth wing vowed to block his appearance.', 'description': 'Zimbabwes powerful vice president says the government will block a university scholarship for young LGBTQ+ people.', 'source_domain': 'apnews.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Hara'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##re'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Zimbabwe'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['apnews.com'], 'dates': ['2024-02-16T15:29:08'], 'languages': ['']}",1

While there is something happening year-round in Zurich  such as photography exhibitions, festivals like ZriCarneval and architectural open houses  theres plenty of seasonal fun to be had in the colder months, whether its eating fondue on a vintage tram or hiking to a winter wonderland atop a local mountain, before tobogganing down.\nRecommendations\nKey stops\nLwenbrukunst, a former brewery that has been converted into a contemporary art complex, features galleries, museums and a bistro.\nPavillon Le Corbusier is a museum dedicated to and designed by the Swiss-French Modern architect Le Corbusier, in an unparalleled location right on the lakeshore.\nSprngli is a high-end cafe with a decadent version of bircher muesli, a breakfast dish of oats and fruit, and quite possibly the best hot chocolate in town.\nFreitag, the Swiss accessories brand known for making bags out of recycled truck tarps, has its flagship store in a tower made out of shipping containers.\nAttractions\nBlemlihalle, meaning flower hall, is a beautiful Augusto Giacometti fresco that is tucked away inside the citys police headquarters.\nKunsthaus, which recently opened an extension designed by the architect David Chipperfield, is Switzerlands largest art museum, with an internationally renowned collection.\nHeureka is a huge kinetic sculpture by Jean Tinguely that marks the spot for a great view across Lake Zurich.\nUetliberg is a small mountain that looks over the whole city and lake and has plenty of refreshment options at the summit.\nSeebad Utoquai, a bathhouse right on the lake, is busy in the summer and attracts the citys hardiest swimmers in the cooler months.\nRestaurants and bars\nBauernschnke is a cozy, modern bistro popular for its pulled pork wrapped in lettuce.\nFondue Tram offers visitors a way to explore the city while dining on a melted-cheese classic.\nOdeon is a more-than-century-old cafe and bar that has attracted many famous political and literary figures over the years.\nSternen Grill is a family-run sausage joint with delicious bratwursts and other Swiss favorites.\nSchnupf is a laid-back restaurant in the lively Langstrasse neighborhood where you can seamlessly flow from cocktails at the bar to steak frites for dinner.\nStereo plays vinyl records and has espresso martinis and Moscow Mules on tap.\nShopping\nAP House is a store by the watchmaker Audemars Piguet inside the marble-clad former cashier hall of what was once Switzerlands oldest bank.\nEdition VFO, a nonprofit that aims to make high-quality art more accessible, sells monotypes and limited-edition prints.\nWhere to stay\nStorchen Zurich has 64 luxury rooms, some overlooking the lake. Its location in the heart of the old town means it is within walking distance of much of the city center. Rooms start at 750 Swiss francs, or about $883, and include breakfast.\nSignau House & Garden is a boutique bed-and-breakfast in a 1912 villa that has been beautifully modernized and furnished. The nine rooms overlook the villas garden, which is surprisingly large given its location only a few tram stops away from the city center. Rooms start at around 295 francs.\nGuesthouse Zollhaus, with 14 simple but modern rooms, is within walking distance of the main train station and is also close to the Langstrasse area. Rooms with an en suite bathroom start at around 133 francs, but options with a shared bathroom are available for less.\nFor short-term rentals, look for Airbnbs in Kreis 1, the citys most central district, or for something a bit more residential with many restaurants, bars and boutiques, consider the Kreis 3 district, also known as Wiedikon.\nGetting around\nIn Zurich, youll see why Swiss public transportation has a reputation for working like clockwork. The city is easy to navigate via its comprehensive network of trams, trains, buses and boats. Getting into the city center from the airport is also quicker and cheaper by train than by car. As an alternative to the standard day pass transportation ticket (from 9.20 francs), you can buy a Zurich Card, a one- or three-day travel pass that includes free or reduced admission to a number of the citys museums (from 29 francs). Uber is also widely available and usually more affordable than taxis.\nItinerary\nFriday\n4 p.m. See a colorful fresco in a police station\nA trip to the police station is not usually a good start to a weekend, but Zurich has a worthy exception. Hidden inside the police headquarters entrance hall is one of the citys most important artworks, a vibrant fresco completed in 1926 known as Blemlihalle, which translates as flower hall. The abstract floral shapes and patterns were painted on the stations vaulted ceiling by Augusto Giacometti, whose last name you may recognize. The Swiss painter hails from the same artistic family as Alberto Giacometti, best known for his spindly figurines. The space is officially open to visitors only between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., Wednesday through Saturday, during which time there are free tours available.\n5 p.m. Admire watches in a landmark former bank\nWander south along Bahnhofstrasse, Zurichs upscale main shopping street, that stretches from the central train station to the lake. Signs of Switzerlands longstanding ties to watchmaking and finance are everywhere. Stop at the AP House, a store opened in 2022 by the luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet and housed in the marble-clad former cashier hall of what was once Switzerlands oldest bank, Bank Leu. Today the majestic building, with its mosaic flooring and imposing columns, is under historical protection. To try on the watches, make an appointment ahead of time.\n7 p.m. Sample new Swiss cuisine or ride the rails with a fondue fork\nZurichs food scene today is more than just hearty Alpine fare. Bauernschnke, in the old town, is a modern, cozy bistro and the first restaurant owned by Nenad Mlinarevic, a Swiss chef who has earned several Michelin stars over his career. Order the house favorite, shareable pulled pork (27 francs), which is marinated with lime, sweet chile and soy, and eaten like a wrap with a lettuce leaf and pickles. If you are craving the classics, opt for a ride on the Fondue Tram. Be ready to hold onto your wine glass and plate on the uphill stretches to stop them from sliding across the table, but it is a fun way to explore the city center and beyond while getting your cheese fix (109 francs for three-course set menu). The first dinner seating leaves from the Bellevueplatz tram stop at 5:30 p.m. for the two-hour ride, and the second at 8:15 p.m. Book ahead; it runs through the end of February.\nSaturday\n10 a.m. Step back in time\nMany of Zurichs historic restaurants and bars have faded away, replaced by trendier or more upmarket establishments, but Odeon, which opened in 1911, has hung on. The all-day cafe and bar was one of the first places in town to serve champagne by the glass, ensuring its popularity, and over the years it attracted the likes of Albert Einstein, James Joyce and Vladimir Lenin, to name just a few. While you are unlikely to spot literary hotshots or political masterminds there these days, many of the Art Nouveau details, including the curved mahogany bar, remain. Start your day with a coffee (from 6 francs) and a croissant (2.50 francs), or opt for one of the heartier breakfast options, and get a sense of Odeons bustling glory years.\n12 p.m. Discover the lakeside (and take a dip, if you dare)\nCross Bellevueplatz, make your way along the lakes eastern shore and pass the Seebad Utoquai bathhouse, open to hardy cold-water swimmers between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on winter weekends (8 francs). Farther along the path is Pavillon Le Corbusier, a museum that is the final work by the Swiss-French architect for whom it is named, and his only building made of steel and glass. The museum, which has housed Corbusiers artworks and designs since 1967, is closed for the season until May, but it is striking even from the outside. Also on the path is Jean Tinguelys Heureka, a large outdoor kinetic sculpture made of wheels and other bits and bobs. This is a great spot to enjoy the view: On a clear day, you can see the snow-covered mountains across the lake.\n2 p.m. Taste Swiss classics, hot off the grill\nCheap is a word rarely used to describe anything in Zurich, but Sternen Grill, back at Bellevueplatz, offers an affordable lunch  by Swiss standards, at least. Skip the full-service restaurant on the second floor and head to the ground-floor counter to order the same food for almost half the price. The third-generation family business remains popular with locals (dont be deterred by the line; it moves quickly), who may be ordering the St. Galler bratwurst (8.50 francs), a veal and pork specialty from eastern Switzerland, or the stubby servelat (7.80), another Swiss classic synonymous with camping trips and made mainly out of pork. Each sausage comes with a brli, a roll with a deceptively hard crust. There is an ongoing debate in Switzerland as to whether or not a sausage should be dipped in mustard. If you dip, know that Sternen Grills mustard has a kick.\n3 p.m. Explore contemporary art in a former brewery\nZurichs art scene may not have the same international reputation as Basel, with its world-famous art fair, but it can more than hold its own. While the crowds flock to Switzerlands largest art museum, the Kunsthaus, with its extensive Impressionist collection, those in favor of more cutting-edge art head to Lwenbrukunst. Wander through the different floors of the former brewery turned cultural complex, now home to a number of stand-alone art spaces, including international galleries like Hauser & Wirth (free) and contemporary art museums like the Kunsthalle (12 francs). Check out the limited-edition prints and monotypes on view at Edition VFO, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making quality art more accessible; most works are priced under 1,000 francs. Visit Lwenbrukunsts website for a list of current exhibitions.\n5 p.m. Climb an unusual landmark\nStroll through the formerly industrial Escher Wyss area, where factory buildings have been repurposed to include a theater, a performing arts center and the Moods jazz bar. The colorful Freitag tower, made from a stack of 19 recycled freight containers, is hard to miss. Built in 2006, the tower is the flagship store of the accessories brand Freitag, which started in Zurich and makes bags (starting at around 130 francs), wallets, phone cases and more out of recycled truck tarps. When the shop is open, you can climb the stairs inside the tower to the top.\n8 p.m. Get your evening going with an apero and steak frites\nOn weekends, Zurichs nightlife moves away from the centrally located bars and out to the loud and lively Langstrasse, a street and surrounding area where people dress expressively and the citys stereotypical polished image falls away. In a century-old building, Schnupf is perfect for transitioning between different stages of the evening: Start with an apero at the bar, dig into steak frites (48 francs) with a zesty Barnaise sauce for dinner, then people-watch with a Negroni Sbagliato (15 francs) as the music turns up later in the night. The menu isnt big, but almost everything, including the ketchup, is made from scratch. The whole artichoke that comes with a gravy boat of vinaigrette on the side (19 francs) is a crowd pleaser. The restaurants owners kept some of the buildings older design features, including a mosaic of two monkeys, which adds to its charm.\n11 p.m. Dance at a vinyl bar\nMake your way up Langstrasse to the relatively new Stereo, a bar that plays vinyl records over a high-fidelity sound system. The midcentury modern interior uses a lot of wood and gives the place a warm feel. Grab one of the specialty cocktails on tap, such as the creamy espresso martini or the fresh ginger-and-yuzu Moscow Mule (18 francs each), then join the dance floor and enjoy the tunes, which, depending on the night, might include electronic, house and funk.\nSunday\n9 a.m. Try an indulgent take on a Swiss breakfast favorite\nHead to the high-end chocolatier Sprnglis flagship cafe  not just for its mini-macarons and its position overlooking Bahnhofstrasse and Paradeplatz, the square at the heart of Switzerlands financial world  but for its bircher muesli, the Swiss dish of oats, typically mixed with yogurt, juice, nuts and fruit (dine-in, 12.50 francs). Sprnglis creamy version of the breakfast staple  invented by a Zurich-based doctor in the early 1900s as a health food  is rich, flavorful and pink, made with raspberries, bananas, apples and red currants. There is also a Sunday brunch buffet (until 1:30 p.m., 65 francs) which comes with a glass of prosecco. Dont miss the decadent hot chocolate (starts at 7.90 francs), made from the same 70 percent dark chocolate that goes into Sprnglis truffles; its very likely one of the best youve tried.\n11 a.m. Gain a new perspective, then sled all the way down\nAlthough the Swiss Alps are easily reachable in a day, Zurich has its own mountain closer to home. At 2,850 feet, Uetliberg may not be a giant, but it offers a few hiking and snowshoeing routes. From the last stop on the No. 13 tram, you can reach the top on foot in under an hour (be warned, the paths can get a bit icy). The summit, which has a lookout tower, has a view over the whole city and the lake. Then visit one of the winter food stands (through Feb. 28), which sell raclette (cheese melted over boiled potatoes and pickled onions, 12 francs), or warm up inside one of the restaurants, which include a fondue chalet, at the Uto Kulm Hotel. To see the view without working up a sweat, the S10 train from Zurichs main station will take you most of the way up. Get out at the Uetliberg station; the top is a 15-minute walk from there. When there is enough snow, it is also possible to rent a toboggan (25 francs) at the hotel and slide back down to town.', 'description': 'Ride a fondue tram, explore art galleries in a converted brewery and toboggan down a mountain in Switzerlands largest city.', 'source_domain': 'www.nytimes.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Zurich'}, {'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Bahn'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##hof'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##stra'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##sse'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.nytimes.com'], 'dates': ['2024-01-04T10:00:01'], 'languages': ['']}",1
An old man leans up against his truck in Granby.,0,1,1,6.081745147705078,"[{'title': 'Inside the two-year fight to bring charges against school librarians in Granbury, Texas', 'date': '2024-07-24T00:00:00', 'content': ""The law enforcement officer spent months methodically gathering evidence. He leafed through thousands of pages and highlighted key passages amid reams and reams of paper. He wore his body camera to record his interactions with witnesses and suspects. And he photographed what he saw as instruments of the alleged crime:\nBooks.\nThe targets of the investigation? Three school librarians in Granbury, Texas. The allegation? They had allowed children to access literature  such as The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison  that the officer, Scott London, a chief deputy constable, had deemed obscene.\nIn an extraordinary look into the ramifications of the right-wing backlash against books dealing with racism, gender, sex and sexuality, an 824-page investigative file obtained by NBC News and NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth shows how, for two years, London vigorously pursued felony charges against librarians in the Granbury Independent School District.\nLondon secured subpoenas, filed public records requests, received names of students whod checked out certain books and, after a year, wrote draft criminal complaints.\nThose charges  distributing harmful material to a minor  were never filed. The investigation came to an end in June after Hood County District Attorney Ryan Sinclair turned down Londons request to indict the librarians, citing a lack of conclusive evidence to charge them with felonies.\nSinclair declined to be interviewed and did not respond to written questions. London, who has ties to the anti-government constitutional sheriffs movement and tried to launch a local chapter of the far-right Oath Keepers militia in 2020, did not respond to questions.\nNBC News is not naming the three librarians because they were never charged with a crime. None of them agreed to be interviewed. Granbury Superintendent Jeremy Glenn declined to comment. The district released a statement saying officials looked forward to putting the matter behind them.\nGranbury ISD respects the due diligence of the district attorney and wholeheartedly agrees that this investigation was without merit, it said.\nLondons investigative file offers the most detailed and visceral picture to date of an attempt to prosecute librarians amid the nationwide campaign by conservatives to restrict childrens access to books depicting sex and LGBTQ people.\nAs London was conducting his probe, at least 18 states considered bills to make it easier to prosecute librarians over contested books, and three  Missouri, Indiana and Arkansas  passed them into law, although Arkansas is on hold pending a lawsuit filed by a group of libraries. Police and sheriffs deputies have been called by parents and right-wing activists to investigate library books in Florida, Missouri, South Carolina and elsewhere, but free speech advocates and librarian organizations say they are unaware of any librarian or school official who has been charged over books.\nIts as if books have become contraband, and its just so alarming, said Kasey Meehan, who leads a freedom to read campaign at PEN America, a free speech nonprofit.\nA series of videos captured by Londons body-worn camera in May 2022 show him striding through school hallways, interviewing administrators and perusing library shelves in search of the offending books.\nIn one video, a middle school librarian leans over a book check-out counter, her hands folded at her mouth, as London lays out the legal basis for his investigation. On the wall behind the librarian are colorful decorations and a quote from Dr. Seuss: The more things you read, the more things you will know.\nTheres been an allegation of books that were in conflict of the penal code in the library, London tells the librarian, and so thats what Im looking into.\nLondon says he has some questions, but under the Fifth Amendment, the librarian is not obligated to answer them.\nI really dont want to at the moment, she says, shaking her head.\nIn another video, London lays out several books on a library table and photographs their covers and copyright pages  logging each as evidence of a potential crime.\nAdam Steinbaugh, a lawyer for the civil liberties nonprofit the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, said the Granbury investigation stands out from other cases hes tracked. Steinbaugh obtained a copy of Londons investigative file through a public records request.\nThis was the first time, he said, that his organization had seen a law enforcement official issue subpoenas and receive records showing how often books had been checked out and by whom, and the first time hed seen an officer draft criminal complaints against librarians. Watching police body camera footage of school librarians being confronted by an investigator was deeply unsettling, Steinbaugh said.\nAnytime youre talking about arresting a librarian for the content of books in a library, thats going to have a chilling effect, he said. Why be a librarian? Why take the, frankly, little pay that librarians, especially school librarians, get, and risk going to prison?\nGranburys battle over school library books began in early 2022. That January, Glenn, Granburys superintendent, directed librarians to remove books that contained descriptions of sex and LGBTQ storylines, according to a secret recording obtained by NBC News, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. The district later appointed a panel of community volunteers to review dozens of books that a Republican state legislator had flagged as inappropriate.\nIn the end, the committee members voted to permanently ban just three of the titles, including This Book Is Gay, a coming-out guide for LGBTQ teens by transgender author Juno Dawson that includes detailed descriptions of sex, and returned the others to shelves.\nThe decision outraged a pair of conservative Christian parents who served on the review committee  a homeschooling mother named Monica Brown and Karen Lowery, who was later elected to Granburys school board.\nOn May 2, 2022, according to a case summary included in Londons investigative file, Brown and Lowery brought their concerns about pornography in school libraries to him. They filed a complaint naming 11 allegedly obscene books that they said could be found in Granbury school libraries. The titles, all of which contained passages about sex or rape, included a popular teen fantasy series by Sarah J. Maas and a pair of books by the acclaimed young adult author Tiffany D. Jackson.\nThe idea that school librarians had been handing out pornography in a town like Granbury  where many folks identify as conservative Christians and 80% of county residents voted for Donald Trump in 2020  seemed far-fetched to some locals, but London committed himself to investigating.\nIn an interview with NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth that aired last year, London said the probe was simply a response to the complaint from Lowery and Brown and not driven by his own views.\nIf a crime is reported to any law enforcement agency, I would expect the law enforcement agency to investigate the crime, he said.\nLowery, however, said in an email to reporters last year that it was London who asked if she and Brown would file the complaint after he heard them speak about library books at a local Republican club.\nMonica and I agreed to do so believing we should support law enforcement, Lowery wrote to NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth.\nA day after taking their complaint, London made his first visits to Granburys administrative offices, and later that week to Granbury High School and a pair of middle schools.\nBody camera footage shows London making small talk with administrators and repeating a joke about being more of a math guy when he was a pupil.\nIn one encounter with superintendent Glenn, on May 3, 2022, London explained his approach to the case.\nJust because I work for the government, I cant go give a 13-year-old a Hustler magazine, London said. If youre showing pictures of a vagina covered in boils, its part of sex ed, you can justify it. But if its smut for smuts sake, its not justified.\nIn each of his meetings with the three librarians, London explained that they were under no obligation to speak with him. One by one, the librarians declined to answer questions.\nIll listen to what you have to say, one librarian told London, laughing nervously.\nI was told not to say anything unless I have legal, another told him.\nPaul Hyde, a Granbury attorney who served on the volunteer committee tasked with reviewing dozens of school library books, said he informally advised two of the accused librarians early in Londons investigation and saw the toll it has taken on them.\nThese women, that are amazing educators and librarians, have been terrified for over two years now that theyre going to get arrested, hauled off to jail on a felony charge of providing pornography to minors, Hyde said, noting that one of the librarians left the district as a result.\nWe lost a great librarian, he said.\nAs the investigation progressed, London reviewed nearly 200 pages of community member complaints about books available in the Granbury district, many of which cited BookLooks, a website tied to the conservative activist group Moms for Liberty.\nHe reported purchasing each of the 11 titles named in Lowery and Browns police report and, over the course of a few months in 2022, read them in their entirety. His investigative file included more than 120 photos of passages he believed to be obscene, with highlights he made with a marker.\nLondon also secured subpoenas for Follett School Solutions, an education software company that Granbury uses to help manage its library collection, to obtain records for the dates and times that several titles were checked out from campus libraries.\nSome of the records in London's investigative file included the names of students who had most recently checked out the books  a clear violation of student privacy, according to First Amendment experts. It is not clear who provided those records to London.\nA Follett spokesperson said in an email, At no time did Follett provide any data that included student names or other student information.\nLondon also sought records from the district about student volunteers who helped librarians return books to shelves. According to the case records, London believed that if he could prove that librarians used minors in the commission of the alleged crimes, it would elevate the charges from misdemeanors to felonies.\nAfter investigating for more than a year, in July 2023, London submitted the case file to Sinclair, the district attorney. By then, London had launched a campaign for Hood County sheriff  an election he would ultimately lose.\nHe included in his report to Sinclair drafts of criminal complaints to charge the librarians with distributing harmful material to minors, citing sections of books in which sexual acts were described.\nLondon named six books from Brown and Lowerys original list that he deemed worthy of charges:\nThree titles from the fantasy series A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas, which include descriptions of sexual encounters.\nGone, a book about the consequences of an inappropriate sexual relationship between a 17-year-old and his teacher, by Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson.\nFade, a title by Lisa McMann in which a teen with supernatural abilities investigates sexual predators at a high school.\nAnd The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, a book about a Black girl in the 1940s who internalizes the notion that whiteness is the standard for beauty and whose struggles are exacerbated by rape and abuse.\nNearly one year later, Sinclair notified London that his office wasnt going to prosecute the case, according to an email exchange last month between London and Sinclair that was included in the investigative file. (The documents released to NBC News and NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth did not include a copy of Sinclairs letter declining to file charges, which London said was exempt from disclosure, but they did include follow-up emails describing the prosecutors decision and reasoning.)\nSinclair rejected the felony case because there was insufficient evidence to prove that the librarians used minors to distribute, exhibit, or display harmful materials, according to the emails. And at that point, the two-year statute of limitations had expired for misdemeanor charges.\nBased on Londons reply, it seemed Sinclair also was not convinced that the books, taken as a whole, met the states legal definition of harmful material.\nOn May 1, London made a final plea to get Sinclair to indict the librarians.\nAfter reading each of these books personally in their entirety, London wrote in a letter included in the investigative file, I cannot fathom any scientific, educational, governmental, or other similar justifications for some of these books.\nUltimately, Sinclair was not persuaded.\nOn June 24, London wrote to Glenn, letting the Granbury superintendent know that it was official: His two-year effort to charge school librarians had ended.\nBrown, one of the mothers who filed the complaint, did not respond to messages requesting comment. Lowery, who continues to serve on Granburys school board, responded to the cases dismissal by defending her efforts to restrict library books.\nI did what I believe I was called to do to make the community aware of this dangerous issue, she said in a statement.\nDeborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Associations Office for Intellectual Freedom, said the case demonstrates the risks librarians now face and the importance of prosecutorial restraint.\nWe do cling to the fact that no prosecutor has accepted this information to create a criminal prosecution, Caldwell-Stone said. Were just concerned that someday someone might choose to do it."", 'description': 'An 824-page file details an officers attempt to prosecute librarians in Granbury, Texas, amid a nationwide battle over the books children are allowed to read.', 'source_domain': 'www.nbcnews.com'}]","[{'entity': 'B-LOC', 'word': 'Gran'}, {'entity': 'I-LOC', 'word': '##by'}]",0,True,"{'num_candidates': 1, 'has_candidates': True, 'source_domains': ['www.nbcnews.com'], 'dates': ['2024-07-24T00:00:00'], 'languages': ['']}",1

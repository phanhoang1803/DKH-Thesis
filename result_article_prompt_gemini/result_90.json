        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a driver evading police by bouncing the car off the roofs of two vehicles.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nIn April 2021, a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed someone evading police in a car by jumping the vehicle off a ramp, bouncing off the tops of of a semi-truck and a bus that were driving by, then landing on the other side of the road and driving away.\nAt the time of this writing, this video had been viewed more than 4.7 million times. This footage, however, does not capture a real car chase but computer generated images.\nIt was created by a 3D artist who uses the handle @2NCS on social media. When this video was posted to the artist's Instagram page, it was accompanied by hashtags such as #3d and #animation to indicate that this was a CGI video, not a genuine piece of footage.\n@2NCS identified himself on his website as a 23-year-old named Dionisis who lives in the United Kingdom: \"My name is Dionisis and I'm 23 years old. I live in UK. For me working as a car designer was a life goal. My motivation stems from the possibility that 3d graphics offer me, turning my imagination into reality. CGI is a great art that changed the way I express myself.\" Dinosis added that he uses the software programs Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe After Effects to create his videos.\n@2NCS has had a few other videos go viral after internet users incorrectly assumed that they were real. In 2019, for example, a video that supposedly showed a Lamborghini evading police by sliding underneath a truck racked up more than 10 million views.\nHere's a look at how that viral video was made:",

      "explanation": "The news caption is directly addressed and refuted by Source 1. Snopes investigated the viral video and determined it to be computer-generated imagery (CGI), not a real event.  The article explicitly states that the video depicts a car \"jumping the vehicle off a ramp, bouncing off the tops of a semi-truck and a bus\", matching the caption's description. However, the article concludes that the claim is false because it's CGI. Therefore, while the video content matches the caption, the claim of real-life occurrence is false.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check found no information about entities in the context to compare with the caption, resulting in a low confidence score and a false verdict.  The external check, however, used Snopes as a source, which verified the video content's alignment with the caption, stating that it indeed depicts a car bouncing off the roofs of two vehicles. However, Snopes crucially debunks the caption's implication that this event is real, labeling it as \"False\" because the video is CGI.  This external validation provides strong evidence that, while the caption accurately describes the video's *content*, it misrepresents the event's reality. The conflict arises because the internal check lacks the information needed to assess the realism of the video, focusing solely on the literal description. The external validation adds the crucial context of the video's artificial nature.  Given that Snopes's assessment carries high confidence (confidence_score: 10), and the conflict is resolved by understanding the nature of the video as CGI, I'm assigning a high confidence score (9) to the final judgment that the caption is out of context because it falsely implies a real-world event. The explanation provided by Snopes directly addresses and resolves the discrepancy by clarifying the video's CGI nature, thus improving the overall confidence in the final verdict.  In essence, the caption is factually accurate in its description of the visual content, but it is misleading because the depicted event is not real.  The high confidence score reflects the strong external validation provided by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking source, which outweighs the limitations of the internal check.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check could not verify the caption due to a lack of relevant entities in the provided context. External check using Snopes confirmed that the caption accurately describes the video content but that the event depicted is CGI, making the caption's claim false.  The conflict is resolved by the external validation's higher confidence score and the clarification that the video is not a real event."

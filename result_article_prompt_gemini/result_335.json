        "title": "Ivory Coast on brink of civil war as seven women killed at protest march",
        "date": "2011-03-03T00:00:00",
        "content": "Seven women have been massacred during a peaceful protest in Ivory Coast as the country appeared to stand on the brink of all-out civil war.\nMore than 200,000 people have fled, and the nation that was once a model of stability in west Africa is now experiencing bloodshed and economic meltdown.\nThe women's demonstration became a scene of terror when security forces opened fire with machine guns in Abobo, a sprawling, impoverished suburb of the commercial capital, Abidjan, where some of the deadliest clashes have taken place during three months of crisis.\nThey were about to set off from a roundabout on a march to call on Laurent Gbagbo to step down as president. \"Men in uniform drove up and started shooting randomly. Six women died on the spot,\" Idrissa Diarrassouba told Reuters. A seventh died in hospital. Many others were wounded.\nThere was no official comment but a military source confirmed the shooting. \"It was a blunder that we regret,\" the source said, adding that security forces believe rebels sometimes hide among civilians. \"It is unfortunate.\"\nThe UN says at least 365 people have died since November's election, nearly all supporters of Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognised winner. The UN said, just after the shooting, that more than 26 people were killed in the past 24 hours in Abobo, where most people come from the country's north.\nMultiple delegations of African leaders have come through Abidjan, but Gbagbo has rejected offers of amnesty and comfortable exile abroad if he leaves office.\nThe UN, other organisations and analysts warn that the country could return to civil war, as in 2002-3, which divided north and south. The International Crisis Group says war is imminent, with skirmishes in Abidjan and the west of the country between militias and army loyal to Gbagbo and the former insurgent New Forces, backing Outtara.\n\"You cannot predict what the outcome will be,\" said Issaka Souare, a senior researcher for the Africa conflict prevention programme at South Africa's Institute of Security Studies. \"Civil war is not inevitable but it's very likely, depending on how the mediation process will go.\"\nOutside military intervention may now be required, he added. That was first threatened in December by Ecowas, the west African regional bloc of 16 nations.\nHowever, Adekeye Adebajo, the executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution at Cape Town University, warned: \"You have a situation that could erupt into civil war. But it could also be a stalemate that continues, which makes Ouattara the big loser. The advantage Ivory Coast has over many other countries in this situation is the presence of 9,000 UN peacekeepers who could maintain the partition.\"\nHe added: \"There will be more clashes but the soldiers from both sides have not shown much stomach for war since 2002. It would take something dramatic for that to change. They each have half now, so why risk losing it all? And would the UN and French peacekeepers step aside? They have an obligation to maintain order.\"\nIn Abobo Gbagbo's forces have been fighting an armed group that emerged last week known as the Liberation Movement of the Population of Abobo-Anyama (the adjacent neighbourhood). The Liberation Movement said its attacks followed weeks of police brutality, arbitrary arrests and abductions of Ouattara supporters. Abobo has also been terrorised for weeks by masked militias and residents believe the armed group consists of rebels from the New Forces movement that has ruled the northern half of the country since 2002, as well as army soldiers who have switched sides. The group now controls a large part of Abobo and Anyama suburbs.\nAid workers and journalists have not been able to get into the area since fighting began last week.\nResidents also say that some streets were littered with corpses, which they have had to burn to ward off disease.\n\"Last week, after the overnight fighting died down, I ventured out to charge my mobile phone and I saw nine bodies,\" said Seydou Kon, who escaped with his wife and two children during the weekend. \"I think they were security forces, but in some cases it was hard to tell.\"\nHe saw \"many more\" bodies later that week, including two policemen, killed because they were suspected of spying for the Gbagbo regime.\nMore than 200,000 people have fled Adibjan's northern suburbs, according to the UN Operation in Ivory Coast. Its spokesman, Hamadoun Tour, said the armed group is preventing people from leaving. \"Entire families, blocked in public places, in churches and parishes, are living in fear and without water or electricity.\"\nIn another area of Abidjan, pro-Gbagbo militias hung a tyre around the neck of a \"foreigner\", what they call people from the north, poured petrol over him and set him alight. Similar incidents have taken place in the interior of the country, with at least six others killed by militias, the Ouattara government said.\nThese brutal attacks on people who are seen as \"foreigners\" or \"rebels\" are unprecedented in Ivory Coast, and have sparked widespread fears of an ethnically motivated civil war.\nMeanwhile, the UN has apologised to Belarus for falsely claiming that it broke an arms embargo against Ivory Coast. Alain le Roy, its peacekeeping chief, admitted the erroneous report was a \"very bad incident for us\".",

Source 1 reports significant violence and deaths in Abobo and Anyama, but doesn't give a precise number of 13 deaths in Anyama.

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both cast doubt on the accuracy of the caption.  The internal check highlights that the image shows a damaged bridge and a crowd but lacks direct visual evidence to confirm the death toll (13) or specific location (Anyama, north of Abidjan).  The lack of visual confirmation of these key entities makes the internal assessment less certain.  The external check corroborates this uncertainty. While a source mentions significant violence and deaths in the specified region, it does not provide a precise number of 13 deaths in Anyama.  This absence of precise numerical confirmation from an external source weakens the confidence in the caption's accuracy. The discrepancy lies in the caption's specificity (13 deaths in Anyama) which is not supported visually or by the external source's less precise reporting of deaths in the broader region.  Due to the lack of visual evidence confirming the 13 deaths in Anyama and only partial confirmation of deaths in the general area from an external source,  the combined assessment indicates a low confidence score in the caption's accuracy. There's insufficient evidence to support the claim of 13 deaths specifically in Anyama.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks show low confidence in the caption's accuracy. The image lacks visual evidence for the specified death toll and location, while the external source only partially corroborates deaths in the general area, without confirming the specific number of 13 deaths in Anyama."

While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem's health quickly registered here at Snopes.\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem's lyrics. We're not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere's how this joke appeared on the \"Dad Jokes\" section of Reddit:\n\"In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies Eminem correctly but fails to verify the claim about his coronavirus diagnosis.  The external check, using a reputable fact-checking source (Snopes), decisively refutes the claim, providing strong evidence that it is false and originated as a joke.  The high confidence score (10) from both checks, coupled with the clear disagreement on the central claim, makes the out-of-context assessment highly reliable. The internal check's focus on entity recognition is limited in this scenario; its inability to verify the factual claim is expected given its nature. The external check's rigorous verification process and citation of source material significantly outweigh the internal check's partial verification.  There is no conflict between the checks concerning Eminem's identity; the conflict lies solely in the accuracy of the coronavirus diagnosis claim.  The external evidence decisively proves the claim is false, rendering the caption out of context.  The strong agreement between the internal check's partial validation of Eminem's identity and the external check's complete refutation of the claim necessitates a conclusion that the caption is significantly out of context. No additional information or validation sources are needed to reach this well-supported conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the image shows Eminem.  However, they strongly disagree on the claim that he was the first celebrity diagnosed with coronavirus.  The external check decisively refutes this claim using a reliable source, leading to a high-confidence conclusion that the caption is out of context."

This is absolutely false.\nA look at the family lineages of each of these public figures provides further confirmation.\nGeorge Soros only brother, Paul Soros, died in 2013. According to obituaries published at the time of his death, Paul Soros had just two surviving children, Peter and Jeffrey. His two other children, Linda and Steven, both died as young children, according to The New York Times.\nWedding announcements published in The New York Times show Jeffrey Soros married Catherine Cosover in 1995 and Peter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997.\nSince George Soros has only two surviving nephews, Peter and Jeffrey, and neither married Gretchen Whitmer, its not possible Whitmer is George Soros niece.\nOn Whitmers side, she is the daughter of the late Sharon Whitmer, a former lawyer, and Richard Whitmer, also a lawyer and the former head of the health insurance association Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.\nWhitmer is married to Marc Mallory, a Michigan dentist. She was formerly married to Gary Shrewsbury.\nFalse claims have been shared widely on social media about both Soros and Whitmer amid the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nWhitmer, criticized for her strict stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been falsely accused of hypocrisy in following those orders.\nSoros, the wealthy Democratic donor who has long been a target of bizarre conspiracy theories, has been attacked recently with a bevy of false claims, including that he paid people to protest after the death of George Floyd.\n__\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption, \"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was the niece of billionaire George Soros,\" is out of context and factually incorrect. The internal check achieves a confidence score of 10, explicitly stating that the image shows Governor Whitmer but the claim of a familial relationship with George Soros is false.  This assessment is based on the straightforward mismatch between the visual information (Governor Whitmer) and the false assertion of her being George Soros' niece.  There's no visual evidence supporting this claim; the image simply depicts the governor.  The external validation further strengthens this conclusion, achieving a confidence score of 10.  It cross-references the claim with a reputable news source (Associated Press) which definitively debunks the claim, citing official statements from Whitmer's office and genealogical evidence. The AP's methodology involves interviewing the governor's spokesperson and investigating family lineages, offering substantial evidence against the claim.  This external verification decisively counters the false statement, leaving no ambiguity. Therefore, combining the high confidence scores from both the internal (image analysis) and external (fact-checking) validation, we arrive at a final confidence score of 10. The complete lack of visual or contextual support for the claim in the image coupled with strong external evidence refuting the claim makes it clear that the caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm that the caption is false. The image shows Governor Whitmer, but the claim of her being George Soros' niece is factually incorrect and unsupported. External fact-checking from a reliable source (Associated Press) provides conclusive evidence against the claim."

        "content": "CNN is suing the White House to demand the immediate return of press credentials to its reporter Jim Acosta after the media pass was revoked last week following a high-profile public contretemps with Donald Trump during a press conference.\nThe US-based cable news giants legal action against Trump and several of his senior aides marks a major escalation in the continuing crisis of relations between the US president and what he calls fake news and the enemy of the people. The cable news network has been at the center of Trumps war against the mainstream media. Within that Acosta, CNNs chief White House correspondent, has become target number one.\nNow CNN is hitting back. It lodged its lawsuit on Tuesday morning with a federal district court in Washington, demanding the immediate return of Acostas so-called hard pass, media credentials that are routinely awarded to political reporters that allow swift access to White House grounds.\nJeff Zucker, CNNs worldwide president, wrote in a memo to staff that we will always stand up for our rights. That is why we have filed our suit.\nHe added: The first amendment grants the right of all journalists to hold those in power accountable and ask tough questions.\nThe pass was revoked last Wednesday after Acosta engaged in robust questioning of the president during the lengthy press conference at the White House after the previous days midterm elections. The reporter in particular asked Trump why he had called the caravan of Central American asylum seekers headed towards the US border an invasion when it was still many hundreds of miles to the south.\nTrump fired back that Acosta was a rude, terrible person. The White House press secretary later followed up by accusing Acosta of placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\nVideo footage of the press conference showed the accusation to be false. A doctored version of the video showing the interaction between Acosta and an intern who tried to take the microphone from him after Trump told the reporter to stop asking questions was later posted on social media by Sarah Sanders. But it had been speeded up to give the impression that Acosta had aggressively thrust his arm at the intern, which he had not.\nIn a statement, CNN said it was bringing the lawsuit against the White House on behalf of all journalists, not just CNN.\nWhile the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone. If left unchallenged, the action of the White House would create a dangerous chain effect for any journalist who covers our officials, the statement said.\nThe lawsuit was directed at Trump by name as well as several of his top aides including the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, the director of communications, Bill Shine, and Sanders.\nOne of the countrys leading first amendment lawyers, Floyd Abrams, told the Guardian that CNNs litigation was well supported by first amendment principles. A journalist may not be stripped of access because of distaste for his questions, a desire to retaliate against him for prior coverage or frustration at what the president may view as a hostile attitude, he said.\nThe White House does have the right to take steps against reporters who make it impossible to proceed in a reasonable fashion, Abrams said. But even in those cases, legal precedent means that the correspondent would be entitled to a statement of how he had supposedly transgressed, a chance to reply and (according to one case) a written statement of the basis for his exclusion.\nThe lawsuit has been strongly backed by the White House Correspondents Association that represents all reporters covering the White House. It said that the president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\nThe White House issued a lengthy statement on Tuesday morning.\nIt began: We have been advised that CNN has filed a complaint challenging the suspension of Jim Acostas hard pass. This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit.\nThe statement went on to say that CNN has almost 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the first amendment.\nThe White House said this was not the first time Acosta had refused to yield to other reporters during a press conference. After Mr Acosta asked the president two questions  each of which the president answered  he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions.\nIt concluded: The first amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the president, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\nHowever, on the day, many of the other reporters present asked Trump more than one question, including asking follow-up questions.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union called the White Houses removal of Acostas pass un-American. It said: It shouldnt take a lawsuit from CNN to remind the president of the first amendment. The White House should reverse its decision immediately.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that Donald Trump revoked the press credentials of six major news outlets.  Source 1 focuses on the revocation of Jim Acosta's credentials from CNN,  a single news outlet. While the article mentions Trump's antagonism towards what he terms \"fake news,\" it doesn't provide evidence that six major news outlets had their credentials revoked. The article highlights CNN's lawsuit against the White House, which is related but doesn't directly corroborate the claim about six outlets.  Therefore, the caption is only partially supported and lacks the necessary evidence to confirm the number of outlets involved. ",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: CNN sues White House and demands return of Jim Acosta's press credentials.  The article details the revocation of CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press credentials. It mentions Trump's conflict with the media but doesn't specify the revocation of credentials for six major news outlets. ",

    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges the image shows Donald Trump but notes the caption's claim about revoking press credentials lacks visual evidence.  The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, but the verdict is True, suggesting that the image is not contradictory to the caption, even without proof.  The external check, however, provides crucial context. While it confirms Trump's antagonism towards the media and mentions the revocation of Jim Acosta's credentials (CNN), a single news outlet, it fails to support the claim of six major news outlets losing their credentials.  The external check gives a much lower confidence score of 4 and a verdict of False. This discrepancy highlights a significant conflict. The external check is more reliable because it attempts to verify the claim using external sources, unlike the internal check which only analyzes the image itself.   The higher internal confidence score is misleading because the image itself is insufficient to verify a claim about specific policy actions (revoking credentials). The external check correctly identifies the lack of sufficient evidence to confirm the claim about six news outlets. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context because it presents an unverified claim regarding multiple news outlets, while the available evidence only supports a partial claim about one (CNN).  The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty. The significant difference in the confidence scores between the internal and external checks highlights the importance of using external sources to corroborate claims and the limitations of using image analysis alone.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the image compatible with the caption but lacks supporting evidence. External check reveals insufficient evidence to support the claim about six news outlets, only partially supporting the claim about CNN.  The external check is more reliable, leading to an OOC judgment."

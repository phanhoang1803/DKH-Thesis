On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check highlights the lack of evidence in the image to support the claims made in the caption.  It notes that the image shows a young girl with a distended abdomen, but this alone does not confirm pregnancy, age, or the identity of a potential father. The confidence score of 3 reflects this uncertainty based solely on the image.  However, the external check provides significantly stronger evidence by citing a Snopes fact-check. Snopes definitively refutes the caption, stating that the photograph is miscaptioned and that it does not depict a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man.  Instead, Snopes identifies the girl in the photograph as a 12-year-old Brazilian girl named Sandy who was suffering from a liver condition. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check stems from Snopes's reputation for fact-checking and their detailed explanation of the image's origin and the girl's actual medical situation.  The external validation's findings directly contradict the caption's claims. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both point to the same conclusionâ€”the caption is false. The external evidence is substantially more compelling due to its verifiable source and specific details. Therefore, integrating both internal and external evidence, the final assessment is that the caption is definitively out of context with a high confidence level of 10. The caption misrepresents the image and propagates false information.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation results strongly support the conclusion that the original caption is out of context. The internal check reveals insufficient evidence in the image, while the external check provides definitive proof from Snopes that the caption is false and misrepresents the identity and situation of the girl in the photograph."

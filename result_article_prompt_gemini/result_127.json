      "explanation": "The Salt Cathedral in Zipaquirá, Colombia is a real place and is known to be a site of religious significance.  Disinfection efforts in public places, especially religious sites, are also plausible, particularly given the context of potential infectious diseases. Therefore, the statement is plausible. However, there is no specific knowledge of a recent disinfection event at the Salt Cathedral.  The lack of specific date and context lowers the confidence score.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check exhibits high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy, primarily because the image directly depicts a person disinfecting what appears to be the Salt Cathedral.  The setting and activity strongly align with the caption's description.  The external check, while also supporting the caption's plausibility (confidence score of 8), points out the lack of specific evidence corroborating a recent disinfection event at the Salt Cathedral.  It rightly highlights that the disinfection of public spaces, including religious sites, is a common practice.  The lower confidence score from the external check stems from the absence of verifiable news reports or official statements confirming this specific disinfection event.  However, this lack of specific evidence doesn't invalidate the caption; it merely reduces our certainty.  The discrepancy between the internal and external confidence scores arises from the difference between visual evidence (internal) and external corroboration (external). The internal check focuses on the immediate visual context of the image, while the external check seeks broader, independent confirmation. Given the strong visual evidence and the plausibility of the scenario (disinfection of a public space), the final confidence score is weighted more towards the internal assessment but adjusted slightly downward to reflect the absence of specific external evidence. The core components of the caption—the location, the building's identity, and the action—are all consistent with the image. This makes the caption reasonably accurate, even without explicit external proof of a specific disinfection event on a particular date.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, but external check expresses some uncertainty due to lack of specific date and corroborating evidence.  Visual evidence strongly suggests the caption's validity, leading to a high overall confidence score but slightly reduced to reflect the absence of perfectly matching external evidence."

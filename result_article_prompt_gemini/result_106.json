        "content": "Kendrick Lamar said on his new album GNX that Nas congratulated him for being selected to perform at halftime of Super Bowl LIX in February.\nPerhaps Nas will make a guest appearance on stage in New Orleans?\nIts hard to predict what Lamar will do with his upcoming performance  or with his music in general. He caught the music world by surprise in releasing his latest album on Friday, then releasing a video for the song squabble up on Monday.\nThe release of GNX gives fans a glimpse into additional songs that might be performed at Caesars Superdome in February. The Athletic in September rolled out early predictions and odds of the songs the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper would perform during the Super Bowl halftime show. Here are updated predictions, which include some of the tracks from the new album:\nNot Like Us\nWhen this song, considered by many as the knockout punch in the Kendrick Lamar-Drake rap beef, was released in May, rapper-turned-podcaster Joe Budden said Drake should be thankful it wasnt the HBCU band season because it would be played at games repeatedly. Well, college football season is here, and marching bands are performing their renditions of the song. Pro teams are playing the song. Youth bands are picking up the song. It even became a theme for the Los Angeles Dodgers during their run to the World Series. Its the new sports theme for this decade: They not like us. They not like us. They not like us.\nChance its played: 100 percent\nsquabble up\nWhen the Not Like Us video was released on July 4, there was a snippet of a song at the start of the video. The snippet had no title. That song turned out to be squabble up from the new album. The up-tempo start and the sample of Debbie Debs When I Hear Music is an ideal choice.\nChance its played: 99 percent\nLike That\nThis song, featuring Future and Metro Boomin, reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lamar said in his verse theres no big three in rap, declaring himself above Drake and J. Cole.\nChance its played: 95 percent\nHumble\nThe NBA used this track as its theme for the 2017 NBA Finals. Its one of Lamars most recognizable songs. Its hard to imagine it doesnt make it into the show. If it doesnt make the cut, GNX tracks might be the reason.\nChance its played: 90 percent\ntv off\nLefty Gunplay joins Lamar in this high-energy song off the GNX album. Lamar screaming Mustarrrrrrd! in reference to producer DJ Mustard quickly has become a meme-worthy expression. At the very least, Lamar has to yell Mustarrrrrrd! at least once during his performance.\nChance its played: 85 percent\nMoney Trees\nThis song includes Jay Rock, as the two once were labelmates at Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Listen to heart pt. 6 from GNX and be reminded how much Jay Rock means to Lamars career. It would be a great moment on stage for a reunion.\nChance its played: 75 percent\nDNA\nThis is one of Lamars biggest songs. Itll be hard to imagine its not part of the show.\nChance its played: 75 percent\nAll the Stars\nLamar teamed up with SZA for this song on the Black Panther soundtrack. Lamar is no longer on TDE, but he remains close with those on the label. SZA would add soul as a guest performer.\nChance its played: 65 percent\nSwimming Pools (Drank)\nIts a slower tempo, but its a great song in a concert setting. It also was the song that introduced many fans to Lamars Good Kid, M.A.A.D City album in 2012.\nChance its played: 60 percent\nKing Kunta\nThis is one of Lamars more danceable tracks from his To Pimp a Butterfly album from 2015. Its a perfect concert song  but will it fit in his Super Bowl rotation?\nChance its played: 60 percent\nFamily Ties\nLamar joined his cousin, Baby Keem, on this song off Keems The Melodic Blue album. Keem has toured with Lamar, so it wouldnt be surprising for them to be on stage together in New Orleans.\nChance its played: 60 percent\nAlright\nLamar performed this at Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium when he was part of Dr. Dres halftime show. Thats the only thing that makes it dicey as to whether itll be part of the upcoming show.\nChance its played: 50 percent\nCollard Greens\nThis was a highlight of ScHoolboy Qs Oxymoron album. Its an up-tempo song and would be another opportunity for Lamar to bring one of his former TDE labelmates onto the biggest of stages with him.\nChance its played: 45 percent\nRich Spirit\nIve heard this song live, and it hits hard in front of a live audience. That doesnt mean it translates to the Super Bowl. Its not a dance song, but its also not a slow jam. Nice, mid-tempo game that could lighten the mood a little, if needed.\nChance its played: 40 percent\nB-, Dont Kill My Vibe\nA popular song, but the NSFW first word of the title means Lamar would have to work around it. Its not impossible, as any song on this stage will have to be cleaned of profanity. There are parts of the song that would work.\nChance its played: 40 percent\nEuphoria\nThis was the first solo diss track from Lamar at Drake. Its unlikely Lamar will want to turn the halftime show into 14 minutes of clowning Drake  but you never know.\nChance its played: 30 percent\n6:16 in LA\nThis Drake diss was never released on streaming services. It was only made available on Lamars Instagram. The song was a hit with fans during Lamars concert on Juneteenth, but again, how much time is he likely to dedicate to diss songs?\nChance its played: 25 percent\nMeet the Grahams\nThe darkest song of the Lamar-Drake feud. It doesnt fit in this setting.\nChance its played: 5 percent\nBad Blood\nTaylor Swift is too big of a star to be a featured performer, but this surprise would send social media into a frenzy. Theres a better chance of Swift sitting in a suite cheering for Travis Kelce than joining Lamar on stage. The more the Kansas City Chiefs win, the chances of this collaboration happening shrink.\nChance its played: 0 percent\nMona Lisa\nThis collaboration with Lil Wayne would have been an awkward fit during the show, but it might have been a hit with hometown fans of Wayne. Given Waynes public disappointment over not being selected to perform at halftime, in addition to his ties to Drake, its hard to imagine him taking the stage at halftime.\nChance its played: 0 percent\nPoetic Justice, feat. Drake\nRemember when Lamar and Drake made music together? This track was released in 2013. A lot has changed since then. Drake plans to be on tour in Australia on Super Bowl Sunday. No one expected to see him in New Orleans in the first place.\nChance its played: minus-1,000 percent\n(Top photo: Santiago Bluguermann / Getty Images)",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) that the image depicts Kendrick Lamar performing, likely around 2013, based on visual clues. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  It reports a low confidence score (2) and finds no evidence in the provided text to support the claim that the image is from 2013. The external check explicitly states that the article focuses on a different event (Super Bowl LIX halftime show), unrelated to the 2013 performances. This major conflict necessitates a careful analysis.\n\nThe internal confidence stems from visual interpretation: the clothing style, the overall image quality, and the apparent stage setup suggest a performance from that era. However, this is subjective and lacks concrete evidence. The internal check does not provide specific references or data to support its high confidence claim.  There's a lack of clear, explicit markers within the image to indicate the date.  Furthermore, the visual features might be typical of other years, making it difficult to pinpoint 2013 with certainty solely from the image.\n\nIn contrast, the external check is based on the absence of supporting information in the referenced article. This absence is definitive evidence against the caption's claim. It directly counters the high confidence from the internal check. The external check's low confidence appropriately reflects the lack of relevant information to support the 2013 claim. The discrepancy stems from the difference in evidence type: the internal check relies on subjective visual interpretation, while the external check relies on the absence of information in an external source.\n\nThe conflict is significant, as one check asserts high confidence in a subjective interpretation, while the other directly refutes the claim with objective evidence of absence of relevant information from a relevant source. The external evidence holds greater weight because it's not based on subjective interpretation. We cannot resolve this conflict by entity analysis because no specific entities such as album names or event names that would confirm or refute the year 2013 are present in the image or the referenced text.\n\nGiven the lack of objective evidence in the image or related article to corroborate the year 2013, and the external check's solid refutation, it is reasonable to conclude that the caption is out of context. The final confidence score is lowered to reflect the uncertainty and conflict between internal and external validation results.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check suggests the image is from 2013 based on visual cues (high confidence), while the external check finds no supporting evidence in a related article (low confidence).  The conflict is significant, and the external evidence of absence of information outweighs the subjective visual interpretation, leading to an OOC conclusion."

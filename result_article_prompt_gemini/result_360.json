      "explanation": "Kestrels are birds of prey that can be found in various habitats, including areas near human settlements.  It is plausible that a kestrel might appear in a car parking area, particularly if there are nearby open areas or potential prey. Eskbank railway station exists in Midlothian, Scotland, and car parking areas at railway stations are common. Therefore, the statement is factually plausible, but requires external verification to confirm the specific sighting.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's assertion, resulting in a high confidence score. The internal check highlights the image's consistency with the caption, noting the presence of a kestrel and the plausibility of the location. The external check further validates this by confirming the existence of Eskbank railway station in Midlothian and the commonality of car parking areas at such stations. The external check also considers kestrels' adaptability to various habitats, making their presence in a car park plausible. There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks.  The confidence score is high because both checks strongly support the caption's statement, and the information provided in the caption aligns with real-world facts and expectations. While external verification is not absolute proof of the specific sighting, it significantly increases the likelihood of the caption being accurate. The lack of contradictory evidence further strengthens the assessment.  The image supports the presence of a kestrel, and there's nothing to suggest the location is incorrect. The high confidence score reflects the combined weight of internal and external evidence. There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the caption. A very slight hesitation in giving a perfect score (10) is due to the inability to definitively prove the location from the image itself; however, the plausibility and lack of contradictory evidence are very strong supporting factors. The external corroboration of the location and the likely habitat for the kestrel outweigh this minor weakness.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption.  The image shows a kestrel; the existence of Eskbank railway station and the plausibility of a kestrel in the car park are confirmed externally. No significant discrepancies were found."

While the event involves priests and processions, the description of \"high priests lining up in Addis Ababa\" is plausible but lacks specifics to confirm.  The festival's focus is on the Jordan River, however, the celebration might involve symbolic reenactments or representations in Addis Ababa itself.  Therefore, the statement is not definitively false but requires more context for certainty.",

    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows a confidence score of 8, indicating that the caption is likely accurate in representing the image. The external check has a confidence score of 6, which is slightly lower. While the external check confirms that Timkat (the Epiphany) is a significant event in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church that celebrates the baptism of Jesus and involves religious processions with priests, it doesn't explicitly confirm the location of the image as Addis Ababa. The external check also highlights the symbolic nature of the celebrations;  the River Jordan is not literally present in Addis Ababa during the Timkat celebration.  The discrepancy between the internal and external confidence scores stems from the lack of precise location information in both the image and caption. The image does show Ethiopian high priests involved in a religious procession, which is consistent with the Timkat celebrations. Although Addis Ababa is not explicitly visible, its plausibility is high given the context of the Timkat festival.  The image doesn't show the baptism of Jesus, but it shows elements of the celebrations.  Considering both checks, there's sufficient evidence that the caption reasonably describes the image, although a lack of specific geographic location in both makes definitive certainty impossible. The overall confidence is therefore lower than if we had explicit location corroboration, but still leans towards acceptance of the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, but the external check points to the lack of precise location information as a limitation.  The overall assessment is that the caption is likely accurate but not definitively verifiable due to this limitation."

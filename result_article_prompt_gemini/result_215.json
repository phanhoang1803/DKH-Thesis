        "content": "Four aid workers were killed last month during fighting in Ethiopia's Tigray region, aid agencies say.\nThe Danish Refugee Council (DRC) reported the deaths of three security guards, while the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said one of its staff members had been killed.\nGovernment forces have been battling the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in the region since 4 November.\nThe government says it is in control of Tigray and the conflict is over.\nBut TPLF leaders say they are still fighting on various fronts.\nMeanwhile, the United States has accused Eritrean forces of entering Tigray, something both Ethiopia and Eritrea deny.\nHundreds, even thousands, of people are thought to have been killed in the conflict, while about 50,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan.\nWhat do we know about the deaths?\nA lot of information about the killings is still unclear. The area is still under a communications blackout so it is difficult to verify information.\nThe DRC said it was \"deeply saddened\" over the deaths of three of its guards.\n\"Sadly, due to the lack of communications and ongoing insecurity in the region, it has not yet been possible to reach their families,\" it said.\nThe IRC said its member of staff had been killed in Hitsats Refugee Camp in Shire on 19 November, two days before government troops took control of the town.\n\"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our colleague; our in-country staff are the very heart of our work and are key in our ability to provide support and assistance to our clients,\" the IRC said in a statement, adding that efforts to gather information continued.\nWhat's the latest in Ethiopia?\nEthiopian troops captured Tigray's capital, Mekelle, from the TPLF on 28 November, but fighting has reportedly continued in parts of the region.\nThe Ethiopian government on Friday denied the conflict was preventing aid reaching civilians.\nAid agencies say blocked access, delays and violence against staff are preventing aid deliveries to the region.\nIn response, a statement from the office of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said: \"Suggestions that humanitarian assistance is impeded due to active military combat... within the Tigray region [are] untrue.\"\nSuch statements undermine efforts to stabilise the region, it added.\nMr Abiy said last week that federal troops had not killed a single civilian in their offensive on Tigray.\nCivilians fleeing fighting in Tigray last month told Reuters news agency that they had seen bombing by government warplanes, shooting on the streets, and people being attacked with machetes.\nWhat is the US saying about Eritrea?\nThe US has called for the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Tigray. The US believes the Eritrean military - which has found common cause with Mr Abiy over the TPLF - entered the region after it came under rocket fire.\n\"We are aware of credible reports of Eritrean military involvement in Tigray and view this as a grave development,\" a State Department spokesperson said.\n\"We urge that any such troops be withdrawn immediately.\"\nBoth Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied that Eritrean troops have been involved in fighting.\nNearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees have been living camps in Tigray. They fled political persecution and compulsory military service, long before the current conflict.\nEthiopia's government said on Friday it was returning a large number of \"misinformed\" Eritrean refugees to Tigray after they had fled to the capital Addis Ababa - a moved which has alarmed the UN.\nWhat is the conflict about?\nThe conflict started on 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is largely supported by the provided article.  The article mentions hundreds, even thousands, of people are thought to have been killed in the conflict, and about 50,000 have fled to neighboring Sudan.  This aligns with the caption's claim of hundreds killed and around 50,000 fleeing to Sudan. The article also details the fighting between Ethiopian government forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which is the cause of the refugee crisis mentioned in the caption. The article's specific mention of refugees fleeing to Sudan further strengthens the support. ",

    "explanation": "The caption states that the image depicts refugees from the Tigray region of Ethiopia waiting to be transferred to a camp in neighboring Sudan. The image itself shows a woman holding a young child, which is consistent with the general situation described in the caption.  However, the image does not provide direct visual evidence of the specific location (waiting for transfer to a camp in Sudan). This is where the internal check expresses uncertainty, scoring 7. \n\nThe external check, however, provides strong support for the caption's claims. It cross-references the caption with an external article that mentions hundreds of thousands of people killed in the conflict and about 50,000 fleeing to Sudan. This aligns well with the general narrative provided in the caption regarding the conflict's impact and refugee movement. The external check's confidence is high, scoring 8.\n\nThe discrepancy lies in the image's limited ability to directly validate the caption's specific details about the location and the act of waiting for transfer. The image primarily shows a scene consistent with the overall situation of the refugee crisis. Although the image alone cannot confirm every aspect of the caption, the external validation significantly strengthens the credibility of the caption. Therefore, the overall assessment favors the accuracy of the caption despite the image's limitations. The final confidence score reflects this nuanced judgment, combining the internal and external checks' results.  We acknowledge the lack of precise visual evidence in the image for the details about location and transfer, but external evidence strongly supports the broader narrative of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check expresses uncertainty about the image's ability to fully confirm the caption's specific details (waiting for transfer, location). External check strongly supports the caption's overall claims about the Tigray refugee crisis based on verifiable external information. While the image's context aligns with the general theme, external evidence provides the main validation for the specifics."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows salt spilled from a fallen shaker that created the image of Jesus on a table.\nA meme popular on social media posits that a photograph depicts a praying diner who was belittled by atheists for his faith until a salt shaker on his table fell and the spilled crystals miraculously formed an image of Jesus:\nThe narrative attached to this picture is a ridiculous and fabricated one, a spoof of the type of inspirational stories known as \"glurge (in particular, the subset of glurge tales involving tests of faith.) The photograph seen here is real, however -- but its explanation is an artistic rather than a miraculous one.\nThe person pictured here is artist Rob Ferrel of San Antonio, Texas, who uses a variety of media to create his artworks, including salt and other food products, as reported on Oddity Central:\nA true artist doesnt really need expensive tools and materials to produce something beautiful, and San Antonio artist Rob Ferrel is the perfect example. For months, he has been treating his Instagram followers with highly realist portraits that he creates using nothing but salt, a few brushes, and a piece of cardstock.\nFerrel begins by pouring salt on a table and then moves it around with brushes until recognizable features begin to emerge. He also uses cardstock for clean, sharp lines. Once the portrait is ready, he photographs it and posts it to Instagram, and then gathers up all the salt to make his next masterpiece.\nHis posts regularly get thousands of likes, but some of the more popular portraits are of Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, John Lennon, Lebron James, the cast of Fast & Furious, and The Notorious B.I.G, which he made on a wooden floor.\nBut its not just salt Ferrel works with. The young artist is so talented that he can produce breathtaking art out of pretty much anything. He runs a salon in San Antonio called Rob the Original Barbershop, where he gives customers crazy haircuts sculpted with logos, patterns, and celeb portraits.\nFerrel demonstrated his \"salt art\" during a television appearance on KRPC's Houston Life with hosts Derrick Shore and Courtney Zavala:",

The article explicitly states: \"A photograph shows salt spilled from a fallen shaker that created the image of Jesus on a table.\"  It then goes on to explain that this is an artistic creation by Rob Ferrel, not a miracle.

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks produced conflicting results regarding the accuracy of the caption. The internal check determined with high confidence (score 10) that the caption is inaccurate because the image depicts a painting of Jesus, not salt spilled to form the image.  The external check, also with high confidence (score 10), claims the caption accurately reflects a source describing the image as salt spilled from a fallen shaker forming an image of Jesus. This discrepancy highlights a significant conflict.  The external check relies on a single source. While the source statement is explicit, it does not provide visual verification. Without access to the original source image described by the external source, it is challenging to resolve this conflict definitively. The internal check directly analyzes the provided image, showing a painting, which is inconsistent with the external source.  Given the strong visual evidence from the provided image, and the lack of independent verification of the external source, greater weight is given to the internal analysis. Therefore, it is concluded that the caption is out of context, likely describing a different image.",
    "validation_summary": "Conflicting results from internal and external validation checks. Internal check (high confidence) indicates the caption is inaccurate, while the external check (also high confidence) claims accuracy.  Visual evidence from the provided image supports the internal check, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

      "explanation": "The caption's claim that a boy left a bicycle behind in 1914, which a tree subsequently grew around, is partially supported and partially contradicted by the article. The article confirms a bicycle is embedded in a tree, but it significantly refutes the 1914 timeframe and the boy-leaving-for-war narrative. The bicycle's abandonment is actually placed in the mid-1950s by an identified individual, Don Puz, who forgot it in the woods. The claim about the war is a common miscaption associated with the image, but the article provides strong evidence against this version of the story. Therefore, while the core image is supported, the specific narrative in the caption is substantially incorrect.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both strongly suggest the original caption is inaccurate.  The internal check notes a discrepancy between the image (showing a rusty tricycle embedded in a tree) and the caption (describing a bicycle left by a boy going to war in 1914). The image itself provides no evidence to support the specific narrative in the caption; the tricycle's age and the circumstances of its placement are not depicted. The internal check gives a low confidence score (8) due to this lack of visual confirmation for the caption's claims. The external check further reinforces this inaccuracy. It cites a source (presumably an article or news report) that directly contradicts the 1914 war narrative.  This source instead attributes the bicycle's (note that the external check also clarifies it is a bicycle, not a tricycle) presence in the tree to a man named Don Puz, who left it there in the mid-1950s. This external evidence provides a concrete alternative explanation, strongly suggesting that the original caption is not only unsupported but also factually incorrect.  The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong agreement between the internal and external validations, both of which point to significant discrepancies between the caption and the actual facts surrounding the image. The discrepancy in the type of vehicle (tricycle vs. bicycle) highlighted by the internal and external checks, is likely due to visual ambiguity or misidentification.The consensus from both assessments is that the caption is not an accurate representation of the image's context.  Therefore, the OOC flag is set to true.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks show strong evidence that the original caption is out of context.  The internal check highlights the visual mismatch between the caption's narrative and the image. The external check presents contradictory evidence, providing an alternative and well-documented history of how the bicycle came to be in the tree.  There is a high degree of confidence that the caption is inaccurate."

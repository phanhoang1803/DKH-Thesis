        "content": "Six people were killed and 16 others injured Wednesday when a passenger train apparently hit falling cargo from a passing freight train as it crossed a bridge in Denmark.\nThe rail operator, Danish Railways, earlier told TV2 that the victims were passengers on a train traveling from Odense to Copenhagen.\nPolice spokesman Lars Braemhoej said that while \"we do not know precisely what caused the accident,\" one possible cause was that cargo from a passing freight train fell off and hit the passenger train. He added there was \"considerable damage\" to the passenger train.\nPolice declined to comment on a report from Denmark's TV2 channel that a container had likely fallen off the cargo train.\nDanish media initially reported that a tarpaulin on a freight train hit the passenger train, which was going in the opposite direction, prompting it to brake violently.\n\"Ordinary Danes on their way to work or heading home from the Christmas holidays have had their lives smashed,\" said Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen.\nPhotos from the scene show the freight train was carrying crates of beer, and the tarpaulin that covered the train was torn in pieces.\nKasper Elbjoern, spokesman for Danish brewery group Carlsberg, confirmed that a freight train transporting its cargo was involved in the accident.\nPolice said those hurt sustained light to moderate injuries.\nJesper Nielsen, who was on the passenger train, told Denmark's TV2 the train \"was out on the bridge when there was a huge 'bang' .... very quickly thereafter, the train braked.\"\nThe accident took place on a road-and-rail bridge, part of the Storebaelt system of bridges and a tunnel linking the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen.",

The location is specified as part of the Storebaelt system, which includes the Great Belt Bridge. While the caption doesn't mention the casualties, the article does. The caption focuses on the rescue effort aspect of the event, which is supported by implication in the article describing the accident and its aftermath.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, stating that the image clearly depicts a train accident on a bridge with rescue workers present, aligning perfectly with the caption's description.  The external check further reinforces this with a confidence score of 10, citing a news article that corroborates the event: a train accident on a bridge in Denmark (specifically referencing the Storebaelt system, which includes the Great Belt Bridge), involving rescue workers.  The external check's supporting points directly link the image to the news report, strengthening the validity of the caption's claims. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both checks independently arrive at the same conclusion â€“ that the caption accurately reflects the content of the image and aligns perfectly with external reporting.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10 out of 10 in each case) provide strong evidence that the caption is not out of context. The external validation also provides specific details, like the involvement of the Storebaelt bridge system, confirming that the location mentioned is correct. The alignment of entities (train accident, rescue workers, bridge) between the image, the caption, and the external news report is consistent and highly reliable. The lack of any conflicting information contributes to the high confidence level.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the caption's accuracy.  The image, caption, and external news report all consistently describe a train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark, with rescue workers at the scene. No discrepancies were found."

        "content": "Claim:\nOn Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration's desire to be on good terms with the European Union.\nApproximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.\nOne conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform's captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said.\nTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation  whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason  we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden's speech.\nConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:\n\"Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.\"\nWhile saying \"I'm eager to hear,\" Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant \"mmmm\" in the word \"I'm\" blended with the next word, \"eager,\" to make a \"mnnm-eager\" sound. That was the source of the social media posts' allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker's reason for saying it.\nA more plausible reason for the president's phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.\nOn several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound), according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.\nIn other words, the claim is false  Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.",

They concluded that President Biden did not use the N-word; the sound misinterpreted as the slur was due to his known speech impediment (stuttering).

    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges the image shows Biden giving a speech, aligning with the caption's mention of Biden's virtual event. However, the claim of a racial slur is not visually verifiable. The internal check's lower confidence score (8) reflects this limitation.  The external check, with a high confidence score of 10, decisively refutes the caption's core claim.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking source, thoroughly investigated the allegation, examining video and transcript evidence.  Snopes' analysis concludes that Biden did not use the N-word; the misinterpretation stemmed from his known speech impediment.  This finding is supported by detailed analysis of the audio and transcript, revealing what Biden actually said.  The discrepancy between the internal and external checks arises from the inherent limitations of visual verification versus thorough investigative journalism. The image alone cannot confirm or deny the use of a racial slur.  The external check, however, provides robust evidence contradicting the caption.  Given the high confidence and strong evidence from the external fact-check, and the internal check's acknowledgement of its own limitations in verifying the slur, the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context.  The external check provides compelling evidence demonstrating that the claim is false.  The weight is given to the external verification because of its thorough methodology and direct refutation of the central claim. The high confidence score (10) reflects this certainty. Therefore, the caption is definitively judged as Out Of Context (OOC).",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially aligns with the caption (Biden giving a speech), but cannot verify the racial slur claim.  External check strongly refutes the claim, providing definitive evidence from Snopes that Biden did not use the N-word. The high confidence score of the external check (10) outweighs the limitations of the internal check (8). The caption is thus deemed out of context."

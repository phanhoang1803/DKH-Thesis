It was -5C (23F) in Manchester and Edinburgh and -3C (27F) in south-west London and Birmingham.\nSnow swept across south-west England, parts of Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, while hilly areas - including the North York Moors and parts of Scotland - will see more snow later, forecasters said.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

However, it doesn't directly state that people were walking through snow in Victoria Park. While the heavy snowfall is mentioned, it's not explicitly linked to the specific location of Victoria Park. The presence of snow in Glasgow is implied, but not in the mentioned park, making the connection between the caption and the article weak.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 5,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows people walking in a snowy park, aligning well with the caption's description. However, the external validation check provides a low confidence score (4). It mentions heavy snowfall in Glasgow and disruptions to transportation and sports, but it doesn't confirm the specific location of Victoria Park.  The external source mentions snow in Scotland but doesn't explicitly link it to Victoria Park in Glasgow. This discrepancy needs to be resolved.\n\nEntity analysis shows alignment between the image and the caption regarding the presence of people walking in snow in a park-like setting. The caption claims it to be Victoria Park, but external validation doesn't confirm this. The external source does confirm snowfall in Glasgow, suggesting the image's context is at least geographically plausible.  The lack of explicit mention of Victoria Park in external sources creates uncertainty. \n\nConsidering the conflicting evidence, we lean towards 'out of context' due to the low confidence score from external validation. The high internal confidence score supports the image's general context (snow in a park), but without concrete external confirmation for the exact location (Victoria Park, Glasgow), the claim remains unverifiable.   Although the image looks consistent with the caption, the absence of solid external evidence lowers the confidence score.  The final decision leans on the principle of caution; lack of strong evidence to support Victoria Park makes the caption potentially out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (confidence score: 10), while external validation provides weak support (confidence score: 4) due to a lack of explicit mention of Victoria Park.  The conflicting scores result in a final verdict of 'out of context' with a moderate confidence score."

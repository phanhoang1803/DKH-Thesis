The caption mentions a 'river', which is a reasonable interpretation of the water body shown. There is no clear indication of a snare.",

This video has been shared with a variety of claims. In some postings, this anaconda is listed as 50 feet long. In others, it's labeled as a more reasonable 10 meters (about 32 feet long):\nThis video has been severely distorted to make this snake appear much larger. While we can't say for certain just how big this snake really was, we can say that the snake appears much smaller than 10 meters long in the unedited version of this video.\nThe unedited version of this viral video has been circulating online since at least April 2018. While that video did not contain much information about where the footage was taken, the video's description was written in Portuguese, which is spoken by the majority of Brazilians.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ti6s_UStUc&feature=emb_title\nThe viral version of this video was stretched to make it appear as if his anaconda (and this \"river\") were much larger than they were in reality. The title of this video, \"sucuri gigante atravessando a estrada\" or \"giant anaconda crossing the road,\" also gives us some more context to help determine this snake's size. While the viral version of this video appears to show a \"50-foot snake\" crossing a wide river, it's clear that this video actually shows a snake crossing a flooded road.",

      "explanation": "The news caption aligns with the information presented in Source 1 from Snopes.  Snopes directly addresses a video showing a large snake (described as an anaconda in some versions) swimming across a river in Brazil. The article explicitly states that the video has been shared with claims of the snake being unusually large (50 feet or 10 meters), but Snopes debunks this, showing that the video is distorted to exaggerate the size.  The core claim of the caption – a video showing a large snake swimming in a Brazilian river – is confirmed, even though the exaggerated size claims are refuted.",

    "explanation": "The internal check and the external check both agree that the caption is not out of context. The internal check identifies that the image depicts a large snake in water, which is consistent with the caption's description. Although the caption mentions a \"snare,\" the image shows a snake. The internal check's confidence is high (8). The external check corroborates the caption with a Snopes article, confirming that a video showing a large snake swimming in a Brazilian river exists. Although Snopes clarifies that the snake's size is exaggerated in the video, it confirms the core elements of the caption (a video of a large snake in Brazil). The external check also has high confidence (8). Since both checks are in agreement and have high confidence, the overall confidence is high (9). The minor discrepancy of \"snare\" instead of \"snake\" in the caption is not significant enough to alter the conclusion that the caption is not out of context. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the caption accurately represents the content of the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the caption is not out of context. The minor discrepancy regarding 'snare' instead of 'snake' is insignificant. High confidence in both checks (8/8) results in a high overall confidence score (9)."

Instead most were walking with a purpose, perhaps to go to work or to pick up lunch.\nThe bigger shops had several people inside but if you looked through the windows of the more specialists shops, the sales assistants were standing alone, with no-one to serve.\nPeople eating in a sit-down restaurant were pretty much eating alone, however places where food could be taken away had a steady trade.\nThere were still a few tourists, strolling down either looking for their hotel or pointing out the sights, but how long they will stay here remains to be seen.\nLondon is not on lockdown - but people are definitely attempting to keep a social distance.\nAll pictures subject to copyright",

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions that streets around popular landmarks in London were quieter than normal due to government measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak.  While this supports the general idea of reduced activity in London, it does not specifically mention Leicester Square or confirm it was deserted on March 17th. The article describes Oxford Street as less busy but not empty, suggesting that a complete desertion of central London locations might not be fully supported.  More specific information about Leicester Square on that date is needed.",

    "explanation": "Internal validation suggests the caption is accurate, with high confidence (10). The image shows Leicester Square appearing deserted. However, external validation provides a lower confidence score (4), indicating that while general reduced activity in London is supported by external evidence, there's no specific confirmation about Leicester Square's desertion on March 17th. The external source mentions Oxford Street being less busy but not deserted, implying that a complete desertion of central London locations might be an overstatement. The discrepancy arises from the lack of specific evidence regarding Leicester Square on the given date in the external source.  While the image strongly supports the caption internally, the absence of corroborating evidence from an external source lowers the overall confidence. A higher confidence score would be warranted if an external source specifically confirmed the deserted state of Leicester Square on that date. Therefore, due to the conflicting levels of confidence between the internal and external checks, and the lack of definitive external corroboration, the overall confidence score is moderate and the caption is assessed as potentially out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (confidence 10), while external validation offers weak support (confidence 4), leading to a final assessment of the caption as potentially out of context. The discrepancy lies in the lack of specific external evidence regarding Leicester Square's state on March 17th."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims an image shows a cruise ship dumping human waste.  Source 1, from Snopes, investigates a viral image with that claim. However, Snopes rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"  Snopes explains that the image shows sand and mud churned up by the ship's turbines, not human waste. While the article discusses cruise ship waste disposal methods, it does not support the caption's assertion that the specific image depicts waste dumping. Therefore, the caption is not supported by the provided article.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly suggest that the original caption is inaccurate and misleading. The internal check, with a confidence score of 3, points out the lack of visual evidence in the image to support the claim of human waste dumping.  The explanation highlights that the image shows a cruise ship near a sediment patch, not waste discharge.  Crucially, the external check, also with a confidence score of 3, corroborates this finding by citing a Snopes investigation.  Snopes verifies that the image is miscaptioned, explaining that the brown cloud-like substance is actually sand and mud stirred up by the ship's propellers before anchoring, not human waste.  The external check further strengthens the case by indicating that, although the article discusses cruise ship waste disposal, it provides no support for the claim made in the original caption.  There is a complete alignment between the internal and external assessments. Both checks independently arrive at the conclusion that the caption is false, and both provide reasonable justifications based on the image content and external sources.  The lack of any contradictory evidence from either source significantly enhances the confidence in this conclusion.  The external check's reliance on Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, adds a layer of credibility.  Therefore, based on the strong alignment and lack of conflicting information, the caption is deemed out of context. The confidence score of 9 reflects the high degree of certainty in this judgment, considering the combined strength of both the internal and external validations and the absence of contradictory evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation results strongly concur that the image caption is inaccurate. The image does not depict human waste dumping, but rather sediment stirred up by the ship.  External verification through Snopes supports this conclusion."

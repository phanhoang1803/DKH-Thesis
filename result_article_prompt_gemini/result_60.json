      "explanation": "The image shows a sheep in a bus shelter.  The caption mentions Gill Mackintosh spotting the sheep, but this is not visually verifiable from the image alone.  The location, Huisinish point on North Harris, is not visible in the image; however, the setting appears to be consistent with a remote location like North Harris.",

      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Sheep are known to wander, and it's not impossible for one to find its way into a bus shelter. The location mentioned, North Harris in Scotland, is a rural area where such an occurrence might be more likely than in an urban setting.  However, the claim lacks specific details to allow independent verification.  There's no information about the date, time, or any supporting evidence beyond the individual's observation.  Therefore, while not improbable, the lack of verifiable details lowers the confidence score.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate, although lacking definitive proof. The image clearly shows a sheep inside a bus shelter, aligning with the caption's core description. The internal check notes the lack of visual verification for Gill Mackintosh and the specific location, while the external check emphasizes the absence of specific details like date and time.  However, both acknowledge the plausibility of the scenario. Sheep are known to wander, and a remote location like North Harris increases the likelihood of such an unusual occurrence. The discrepancies are minor â€“ the internal check focuses on the lack of visual evidence for the person and precise location mentioned in the caption, while the external check highlights the absence of corroborating evidence beyond the individual's observation.  Neither discrepancy undermines the core claim of a sheep in a bus shelter in a rural area. The confidence score is 8, reflecting the plausibility of the caption based on the visual evidence and knowledge of sheep behavior in rural areas, while acknowledging the lack of definitive proof and absence of additional supporting information.  To increase confidence, additional details such as the date, time, or independent corroboration would be needed. In the absence of contradictory information and given the inherent plausibility, the caption is judged as not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible, though lacking in specific verifiable details. The core claim (sheep in a bus shelter) is supported by the image, while the lack of proof for peripheral details (person, exact location, date) lowers the overall confidence score."

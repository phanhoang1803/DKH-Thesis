That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that the FBI raided the CDC to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism.  Source 1 mentions a claim about such a raid, but explicitly labels it as a hoax.  The source details the claim, but its reliability is questionable given it's attributed to a \"known hoax purveyor\".  The article includes unsubstantiated allegations about President Trump ordering the raid,  involvement of specific individuals (Dr. William Thompson, Sally Yates), and a supposed link between vaccines and autism. Therefore, the claim in the news caption is not supported by reliable evidence and is presented as a hoax by Source 1.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the FBI raided the CDC to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism. This claim is deemed false based on both internal and external validation.\n\nInternal validation reveals a significant discrepancy. The image shows the CDC building, but there is no visual evidence of an FBI raid. The absence of any depiction of such an event undermines the caption's assertion, leading to a low confidence score of 8 in the internal check. The entities \"FBI\" and \"CDC\" are mentioned, but the action described is unsupported visually.\n\nExternal validation confirms the internal assessment. An external source labels the claim as a hoax, detailing unsubstantiated allegations about President Trump ordering the raid, involvement of specific individuals, and a supposed link between vaccines and autism.  The source's confidence in classifying the statement as a hoax influences the external check's score of 3. Although a source mentioning the claim exists, its reliability is questionable due to the claim's association with a known hoax purveyor and its inclusion of unfounded allegations. This absence of credible external evidence corroborates the low internal confidence.\n\nThe internal and external checks decisively agree. Both assessments independently refute the caption's claim and highlight the absence of credible support.  The consensus from both evaluations underscores the caption's misrepresentation of the visual content and the lack of factual evidence.\n\nDiscrepancies between the checks are minimal. Both analyses converge on the falsity of the caption. There's no significant conflict; rather, both approaches provide complementary perspectives strengthening the overall conclusion. The high degree of agreement allows for a high confidence score in the final determination.  No entity analysis is needed to resolve conflicts because the assessments are in perfect agreement.\n\nIn summary, due to a lack of visual evidence in the image and the debunking of the claim by an external source identifying it as a hoax, we conclude with high confidence that the caption is out of context.  The caption misrepresents the context by fabricating an event (the FBI raid) that is not depicted in the image and is demonstrably false based on existing reliable information.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image lacks evidence of the described FBI raid, and external sources identify the claim as a hoax, resulting in a high confidence score that the caption is false."

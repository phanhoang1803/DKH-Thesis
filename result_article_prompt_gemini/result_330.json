      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  It describes a common family scene: a parent observing and commenting on a child's activity. Horses on a beach are not unheard of, and Balmedie beach in Scotland is a real location. The caption contains no obvious inconsistencies or factual errors. However, without further evidence, it's impossible to definitively verify the statement's truth. The claim is not inherently unbelievable, but its verification would require additional information.",
      "supporting_points": "- Balmedie beach exists in Scotland.\n- Horses are sometimes found near beaches.\n- The statement is grammatically correct and stylistically plausible for a social media caption.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks show high confidence (8 out of 10) in the accuracy of the caption. The internal check aligns the caption with the image content: a girl, possibly Rosie, is shown watching horses on what appears to be a beach. The external check confirms the plausibility of the caption by verifying the existence of Balmedie beach and the possibility of horses being present on beaches. There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks. While we cannot definitively verify the name \"Rosie\" or the source \"Ruaraidh McMahon\" without additional information, the core elements of the caption align well with the image and external knowledge. The lack of absolute certainty about the identity of the girl and the source lowers the confidence score to 8, acknowledging the absence of direct corroborating evidence. Therefore, the caption is considered reasonably accurate and not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "High confidence from both internal and external checks supports the caption's accuracy. Minor uncertainties regarding the girl's name and the source remain, lowering the confidence score slightly."

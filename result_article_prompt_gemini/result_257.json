The attendance numbers were disappointing for the Trump campaign, to say the least, as they had boasted in the days leading up to the event that they had received more than a million RSVPs for the event.\nAs Trump's defenders attempted to explain away the rally's poor attendance, some social media users attempted to flat out deny that the event was poorly attended by claiming that the media was lying about attendance figures, and by circulating photographs that they claimed showed how the arena was actually packed during the event.\nBelow is one such posting:\nThis appears to be a genuine photograph from a Trump rally  but it wasn't taken at the Tulsa rally in June 2020. This image appears to have been taken at a November 2019 Trump rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.\nThe BOK Center has the capacity for 19,000 people. According to the Tulsa Fire Department, the arena was less than half full during Trump's rally, with an attendance of 6,200 people.\nWhile the above-displayed post claims that the viral images of empty seats at Trump's Tulsa rally were taken before the event started, there are plenty of images showing these empty seats while Trump was on stage:\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump reelection campaign, disputed the fire department's count, arguing that there were closer to 12,000 people at the rally. Regardless, the above-displayed image was not taken at the BOK Center in Tulsa in June 2020.\nThe image in the viral Facebook post appears to show the scene at President Trump's rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida in November 2019. While it's difficult to read, the words \"Florida Welcomes\" seem to be written at the top of the jumbotron. Photographs and videos from this rally appear to show the same blue banner wrapped around the arena, the same division and color of seats, the same jumbotron, and the same setup for the stage as seen in the viral image.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that a photograph shows a packed arena at President Trump's June 2020 Tulsa rally.  However, Source 1 (Snopes) directly contradicts this, stating that the Tulsa Fire Department reported only around 6,200 people attended, significantly less than the arena's 19,000 capacity. While the article mentions that some social media users circulated photos claiming a packed arena, it debunks these claims by identifying the image as being from a different Trump rally in November 2019.  Therefore, the caption's assertion is contradicted by the fact-checked information provided in the source.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy based on visual analysis of the image. The image depicts Donald Trump at a rally in what appears to be a large arena, filled with a sizable crowd.  The caption aligns well with this observation. However, the external check (score 3) strongly contradicts this assessment by referencing Snopes fact-check. Snopes explicitly states that the provided image is NOT from the June 2020 Tulsa rally as claimed in the caption but rather a different rally in November 2019. Snopes further corroborates this by citing the Tulsa Fire Department's official attendance report, which significantly undercuts the caption's implication of a \"packed arena.\" The discrepancy between the two checks is substantial. The internal check relies on visual interpretation, which can be subjective and misleading. In contrast, the external check relies on verifiable facts (the fire department's official report and Snopes' image verification). Because of this external evidence, the high confidence score from the internal check is significantly reduced.  The external evidence presents irrefutable evidence contradicting the claim. Therefore,  the conclusion that the caption is out-of-context is strongly supported and the overall confidence score reflects this.  The external validation outweighs the internal validation in this instance, due to the reliability and specificity of the external source.  In summary, while the image superficially supports the caption, verifiable external evidence decisively shows the caption to be factually incorrect regarding the specific event depicted.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the caption's alignment with the image's content. However, external fact-checking reveals that the image is from a different event, contradicting the caption's claim about the June 2020 Tulsa rally. The external evidence is more reliable, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out-of-context."

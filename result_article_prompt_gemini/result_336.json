While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

Source 1 directly addresses this, stating that images of a purple lobster circulated online, but these were digitally manipulated and not genuine photographs of a Maine lobster catch.

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) based on the visual appearance of the image, aligning with the caption's description of a purple lobster. However, the external check significantly contradicts this with a low confidence score (3) by citing a news article that debunks the image as digitally manipulated. The article states that while a purple lobster is theoretically possible, no genuine photographs of such a catch in Maine exist.  This discrepancy necessitates a careful consideration of both assessments. The high internal confidence stems from the straightforward interpretation of the image itself, which appears to show a purple lobster. However, the external validation carries significant weight due to its sourcing from a news report directly addressing the authenticity of these images.  This report strongly suggests that the image, despite its appearance, is a digital fabrication. This external evidence is crucial because it adds a layer of factual validation lacking in the purely visual internal assessment.  In essence, the internal check relies on a superficial analysis of the image's content, while the external check delves into the image's provenance and authenticity. Given the strong external evidence contradicting the internal assessment, and the explicit statement in the news article that confirms these images are not genuine depictions of a lobster caught in Maine, the final judgment is that the caption is out of context. The final confidence score reflects the strength of the external validation and the clear contradiction presented by the news report, outweighing the confidence placed solely on visual interpretation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the caption's alignment with the image, while the external check reveals the image is digitally manipulated, contradicting the claim of a genuine Maine lobster catch. The external evidence outweighs the internal assessment, deeming the caption out of context."

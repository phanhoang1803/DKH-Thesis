Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map  with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\nCruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernies base,\" implied  if not directly asserted  that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\nThis is Bernies base  the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment  no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\nKimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:",

      "explanation": "The caption's claim is partially supported. While the source mentions a video showing people failing to identify countries on a map, it explicitly states that those individuals were not identified as Bernie Sanders supporters.  The video was from a comedy segment, and the individuals were randomly selected. Therefore, the claim lacks the crucial element of verification that the participants were, in fact, Sanders supporters. The source does highlight the original tweet's implication that the individuals in the video were Sanders supporters.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that a video shows supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders failing to identify countries on an unlabeled world map. The internal check reveals a low confidence score because the provided image only shows a man, possibly a Bernie Sanders supporter, but it lacks the video evidence to confirm his failure to identify any country.  The video context is crucial for assessing the caption's accuracy. The external check also has a low confidence score, revealing inconsistencies between the original caption's assertion and the actual video content.  The video source mentions people failing to identify countries but does not confirm them as Sanders supporters; instead, it clarifies that the people were randomly selected. This discrepancy casts doubt on the caption's accuracy, especially considering that the external source highlights that the video's implication about Sanders' supporters was made by someone else, not the video creators.  There is a significant conflict between the caption and the information from the external source. While the caption asserts Bernie Sanders supporters were featured, the external source states that individuals were randomly chosen.  The internal check lacks video evidence, and the external check highlights the absence of evidence supporting the claim about Sanders' supporters. The overall assessment is a moderate confidence score of 6 indicating a significant likelihood that the caption is out of context given the lack of solid evidence aligning with its claims.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks show low confidence in the caption's accuracy. The internal check lacks video evidence to support the claim of Sanders supporters' failure to identify countries, while the external check reveals a mismatch between the original claim and the video content. The video subjects were randomly selected, not necessarily Bernie Sanders supporters. The significant conflict between internal and external analysis supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

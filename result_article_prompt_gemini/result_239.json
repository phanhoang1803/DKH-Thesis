Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map  with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\nCruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernies base,\" implied  if not directly asserted  that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\nThis is Bernies base  the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment  no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\nKimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:",

      "explanation": "The caption's claim is partially supported.  Snopes reports a video showing individuals failing to identify countries on a blank map, but crucially notes that these individuals were not identified as Bernie Sanders supporters.  The video's use by Senator Cruz to imply a connection to Sanders' supporters is considered misleading by Snopes.  Therefore, while the core element of the video exists, the linkage to Sanders' supporters is unsubstantiated.",

    "explanation": "The internal check aligns with the caption's core description: a video depicts individuals failing to locate countries on a world map.  However, the internal check acknowledges a crucial discrepancy: the caption links these individuals to Bernie Sanders' supporters, a connection not visually evident in the video itself. The internal check's confidence is relatively high (10) because of this direct alignment with the video's core content, but the lack of explicit visual evidence weakens this confidence.  The external check (Snopes) provides crucial counter-evidence, explicitly stating that the individuals in the video were not identified as Bernie Sanders supporters. Snopes' confidence score is moderately high (7), because it's referencing a known fact-checking source.  The conflict lies in the caption's assertion linking the individuals to Sanders' supporters, which the external check refutes.  Therefore, while the video depicts the core action described in the caption, the crucial link to Bernie Sanders' supporters is unsubstantiated and misleading, hence rendering the caption out-of-context. The high confidence score (8) reflects the strong evidence from both internal and external checks, indicating a clear disagreement on the Sanders supporter link.  The overall assessment prioritizes the external validation (Snopes) as a more reliable source for verifying factual claims, especially given the absence of visual evidence in the video to support the link to Bernie Sanders.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the video's core content but questions the link to Sanders supporters. External check (Snopes) refutes this link, deeming the caption misleading. Both checks have high confidence scores, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context due to the unsubstantiated link."

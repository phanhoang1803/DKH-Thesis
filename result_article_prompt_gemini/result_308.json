        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the caption's alignment with the image, focusing on the presence of the Annabelle doll.  It correctly identifies the doll in the image and notes that the caption mentions the doll's escape. However, due to the image lacking contextual information about the escape, the internal check's verdict is inconclusive (True). The external check, on the other hand, directly contradicts the caption's claim. With strong evidence from Snopes.com and a YouTube video by Tony Spera, the external check definitively establishes that the Annabelle doll never escaped. This creates a significant discrepancy. The high confidence scores (10) in both checks underscore the reliability of their respective findings.  When faced with such a conflict between high-confidence internal and external evidence, we prioritize the externally verified information.  The external evidence decisively proves the caption's falsity—the claim of the Annabelle doll's escape is a false narrative.  Therefore, the caption is out of context.  The explanation given by Snopes is explicit in its denial of the escape. The video by Tony Spera, son-in-law of the Warrens, further supports this. It’s important to note that the internal check's verdict was primarily limited to the image, which does not contain location information needed to confirm the escape.  Thus, the high confidence score of the internal check is conditional on its limited scope.  This limitation is resolved by the robust external evidence, which has sufficient contextual data to confirm the falsehood of the claim. Consequently, the final verdict on the caption is 'out of context' with a confidence score of 10 based on the conclusive external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the image consistent with the caption's mention of the Annabelle doll but could not verify the escape claim due to lack of contextual information. The external check definitively debunked the escape narrative, resulting in a final verdict that the caption is out of context."

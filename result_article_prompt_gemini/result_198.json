        "content": "US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened a government shutdown over funding for his proposed border wall in a budget row with top Democrats.\nDuring a heated exchange with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, Mr Trump said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government over border security.\nIf lawmakers cannot agree on a federal budget, funding for some departments will run out at the end of next week.\nMr Trump has asked to include $5bn (4bn) in the deal for border security.\nBut Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Pelosi said they had agreed to extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security at current levels of $1.3bn (1bn) until 30 September 2019.\nMr Trump opened the Oval Office meeting calling it a \"great honour\" to have Mr Schumer and Mrs Pelosi present, in their first meeting since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the November mid-term elections.\nBut the meeting soon turned contentious as Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer argued that the Republican-controlled Congress could pass legislation before funding for some agencies was set to expire on 21 December.\nThe president contended that it could only pass if it met his demands for more funding for his proposed border wall along the US southern border.\n\"If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,\" Mr Trump said.\n\"And I am proud to shut down the government for border security. I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.\"\nThe clock is ticking...\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington\nDonald Trump opened his press event with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer with a feel-good embrace of bipartisanship.\nIt didn't last long.\nThe two Democrats and the president sparred over funding for the Mr Trump's proposed border wall. It seemed for a moment as though they might agree on funding for \"border security\" - but that linguistic pirouette disappeared beneath an onslaught of acrimony.\nThe president wants his wall funding. He campaigned on it. He promised it. And even though Mexico isn't going to pay for it, he wants it now.\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are loath to give him this victory. What's more, they're intent on having the blame for any government shutdown directed solely at the president.\nIn the end Mr Trump gave the Democrats what they wanted. He said he would shut down the government if \"we don't get what we want\". He would be \"proud\" to do it.\nDemocrats will try to make the president regret those words. Mr Trump, on the other hand, thinks the public - or at least his base - is with him in this fight.\nIf neither side blinks, we'll know who is right in a few weeks.\nIn an official readout following the meeting, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Democrats have \"made clear they would rather keep the border open than the government open\".\nAfter the meeting, Democrat Chuck Schumer condemned Mr Trump's \"temper tantrum\" in the White House Oval Office.\nNancy Pelosi, who is expected to become Speaker of the House when Democrats take over the chamber next month, mocked Mr Trump at a later meeting with colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n\"I was trying to be the mom,\" she said, sources told US media. \"It goes to show you: you get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.\"\nShe reportedly added that the president's insistence on a wall was \"a manhood thing\".\nHours before the meeting, Mr Trump tweeted that \"the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall\".\nBut a defence department said later: \"To date, there is no plan to build sections of the wall.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects an argument between Ms. Pelosi and President Trump regarding the border wall, as reported in Source 1.  The article details a heated Oval Office meeting where they clashed over funding. While the caption states the meeting happened \"last month,\" the article specifies it occurred in the context of budget negotiations before a government shutdown deadline, providing a timeframe. Pelosi's specific words and tone are reported indirectly through paraphrasing of sources and quotes from her later comments. This indirect nature slightly reduces the confidence score, but the core event and participants are confirmed.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check notes the presence of the key figures (Pelosi, Trump) in what appears to be the Oval Office, with Pelosi's emphatic gesture suggesting a heated discussion. This aligns perfectly with the caption's description of an argument between Pelosi and Trump during a meeting about the border wall.\n\nThe external check corroborates this by citing a news source that directly reports a contentious meeting between Pelosi and Trump concerning the border wall, in the context of budget negotiations before a government shutdown.  Although the exact words exchanged aren't directly quoted, the source clearly states that an argument did occur, matching the caption's assertion.\n\nWhile the external check points out that the caption states \"last month\" whereas the source gives a more precise timeline tied to budget negotiations, this minor discrepancy does not negate the core event description.  The reference to \"last month\" is sufficiently vague to encompass the timeframe indicated by the news source.  The external check also highlights that Pelosi's subsequent actions and comments are reported as further evidence of a dispute with Trump.\n\nThere is complete alignment between the image, the caption's description of the scene, and the external verification. The minor discrepancy on time is not significant enough to question the overall accuracy. Thus, the caption is considered to be accurately representing the scene.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The internal check finds entity alignment (persons and setting) and the external check verifies the reported argument between Pelosi and Trump over the border wall. A minor time discrepancy is insignificant in light of strong corroboration."

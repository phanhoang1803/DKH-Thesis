        "content": "Claim:\nSetting your Apple device's date to 1 January 1970 will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.\nIn February 2016, a rumor began to spread that iPhones and iPads contain a nifty Easter egg: If you set the date of your Apple product to 1 January 1970 then reboot, it will bring up a retro-themed menu based on the old Apple computer operating systems.\nText on the image read:\nBlast from the past\nThe original Macintosh introduced the world to computers, forever changing the way people experience technology, and allowing people to do things that were never possible before. With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, its a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phones date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablets operating system that youll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so theres not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, its possible  at least in theory  that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says its looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.",

Source 1 directly addresses this claim, stating that the claim is a hoax and that doing so may damage the device.

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows high confidence (10) that the caption aligns with the image, as the image shows the specific action (setting the date to January 1, 1970) mentioned in the caption. However, the external validation reveals that the claim in the caption, regarding the retro-themed Easter egg, is a hoax according to the referenced source.  The source directly contradicts the caption's central claim, stating that such an action can damage the device. While the external validation acknowledges the existence of the rumor, it strongly refutes the core assertion of the caption.  The conflict lies in the difference between the image, which shows the action, and the factual accuracy of the caption's claim regarding the resulting Easter egg. Since the external validation offers compelling evidence against the caption's central claim, and possesses a lower confidence score (4),  the overall confidence score is lowered to reflect this. The substantial discrepancy between the internal and external checks necessitates a conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image accurately shows the action of setting the date, but the caption's claim about the consequence of that action is false.  The weight is given to the external validation since it provides factual information about the actual outcome, not just an interpretation of the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's alignment with the image (confidence 10). External validation reveals the claim about the Easter egg is false, citing a source that debunks the rumor (confidence 4).  The discrepancy leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

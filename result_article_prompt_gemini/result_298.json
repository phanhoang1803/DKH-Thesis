        "content": "BNEI BRAK, Israel (AP)  When Israel went into its second nationwide coronavirus lockdown in September, most of the country quickly complied. But in some ultra-Orthodox areas, synagogues were packed, mourners thronged funerals and COVID-19 cases continued to soar.\nThe flouting of nationwide safety rules in ultra-Orthodox areas reinforced a popular perception that the community prioritizes faith over science and cares little about the greater good. It also has triggered a backlash that threatens to ripple throughout Israeli society for years.\nMany Israelis understand that there is a serious challenge and we cannot just sort of allow time to pass and hope that this issue will go away, said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a think tank that studies Israeli society and politics.\nOver the years, the ultra-Orthodox minority has wielded outsize influence over broader Israeli society, using its kingmaker status in parliament to secure generous budgets and benefits for its people and generating resentment among the broader public.\nThe events of 2020 brought long-simmering tensions to a boil. Medical experts estimate the ultra-Orthodox have accounted for about one-third of the countrys coronavirus cases, despite making up just 12% of the population.\nAvraham Rubenstein, mayor of the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, calls the uproar unfair. Rubenstein has been widely praised for overseeing a successful effort to bring one of Israels worst coronavirus outbreaks under control in just a few weeks. He believes the anger toward the ultra-Orthodox is motivated by ignorance, animosity and hostile media coverage.\nThere is a creator of the universe, he acknowledged. We are believers. But when you go outside in Bnei Brak, the first thing you will see is people wearing masks and keeping their distance.\nRubenstein says the lawbreakers are a tiny percentage of the ultra-Orthodox community and that the high infection rates are due to crowded conditions in his city. Ultra-Orthodox Jews live in some of Israels poorest cities and neighborhoods. It is common for families of eight or 10 people to be crowded together in small apartments.\nEarly on in the coronavirus crisis, Israel was seen as a model of success. The country moved quickly last spring to seal its borders and impose lockdown restrictions that appeared to bring the virus under control. But the reopening of the economy was mismanaged, and the virus quickly returned.\nThe neighboring Palestinian territories  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  are coping with their own crises.\nWith a poorer population and much less advanced medical system after years of Israeli occupation, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank has repeatedly imposed lockdown measures, devastating an already fragile economy.\nThe Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, stifled by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, did not report a single case of community-spread coronavirus until August. But the numbers have spiked since then, raising fears that its decrepit health system could collapse.\nBy mid-December, Israel reported 3,749 cases per 100,000 population. On the West Bank, there were 2,798 cases per 100,000 people; in Gaza, 1,327, according to the World Health Organization.\nIn Israel, the ultra-Orthodox were not the only ones who struggled. Israels Arab minority also has experienced disproportionately high infection rates, in large part because of the popular custom of holding large weddings. Young Israelis, Jewish and Arab, flocked to beaches and parties. And many middle-class Israelis have participated in mass demonstrations against Netanyahu as the economy has suffered and unemployment has soared.\nRubenstein won plaudits for bringing in a retired army general to manage the crisis last spring. His city operates numerous programs to assist the ill and their families and maintains a situation room that keeps close tabs on infections. It has enlisted hundreds of volunteers who have recovered from COVID-19, believing they are no longer contagious, to help older residents. Many people worship outdoors, and synagogues throughout the city have put up plastic sheets to keep attendees safe from one another.\nRubenstein says Israelis must understand that the ultra-Orthodox, who avoid computers and the Internet and consider religious study to be essential like water and oxygen. Their schools have remained open while other children study remotely. He says they must be allowed to manage things in their own way, but that doesnt mean people want to be sick or dont consider themselves proud Israelis.\nWe are an inseparable part of the country, he said.",

There is no mention of clowns performing to entertain Palestinians during lockdown in Gaza. The article mentions lockdowns in Gaza and the challenges faced by the Palestinian population, but it does not support the claim about clowns.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) that the caption aligns with the image content. The image depicts two clowns attempting to entertain children through a window, seemingly in Gaza. The children appear to be Palestinian.  However, the external check contradicts this with a low confidence score (3), stating that there's no supporting evidence from external sources about clowns performing in Gaza during a lockdown. The external source focuses on the impact of the pandemic in Israel and Palestine but doesn't mention clown performances.  The discrepancy arises because the internal check relies solely on visual interpretation of the image, while the external check requires corroborating evidence from external sources.  Since the external validation uses a relevant source focused on the events in the area during that time period and finds no supporting evidence for the claim, the visual evidence alone is not sufficient to confirm the caption's accuracy. Therefore, it is more likely that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on image content, while the external check finds no corroborating evidence, leading to a final assessment of the caption being out of context."

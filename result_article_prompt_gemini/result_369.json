        "content": "Claim:\nA man in Ireland earned the nickname \"Shawshank Husband\" after he dug a tunnel from his bedroom to a local pub over the span of 15 years.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nInternet legend has it that an Irish plumber spent 15 years digging a tunnel from his house to a local pub so that he could enjoy a drink at his leisure without his wife's permission. This story has appeared on several web sites over the years, and despite its rather ludicrous premise it has repeatedly taken in some gullible social media users.\nThis rumor started with a September 2014 post on the web site \"Tyrone Tribulations\" entitled \"Omaghs Shawshank Husband Dug Tunnel from Bedroom to Pub Over 15 Years\":\nAn Omagh plumber tunnelled a hole from under his bed to the local pub 800 feet from his house over the course of 15 years, a court heard today.\nPatsy Kerr had been summonsed to Omagh County Court after it emerged he had been the cause of a collapsed sewage pipe from a neighbouring house. Kerr told the court about his secret tunnel and the reasons behind it:\nThe wife has a bad snore on her and after watching the Shawshank Redemption on RTE one night in 1994, I decided to do something about it so I waited til she was in a deep sleep and then set about digging a hole under the bed in the direction of the pub. I used all manner of tools from spoons to a heavy duty tunnel boring machine I managed to sneak down there when she was at the shops. It wasnt until 2009 that I hit the jackpot and came up through the womens toilet mop and bucket room.\nThe story was picked up by viral web sites such as Boing Boing and BuzzFeed (both of which later admitted that they had been fooled) before it spread to less reputable sites such as 8shit.net. As of October 2018, web sites such as mens-corner.net were still presenting this story as if it were a genuine piece of news.\nThis tale, however, is just a humorous bit of fiction.\nTyrone Tribulations did not specifically mark this story as satire, but it was replete with sufficient ridiculous details to clearly indicate that it was a work of fiction. The most telling aspect is likely found in the closing paragraph, which depicts a wife who simply shrugged off the fact that her husband routinely smelled of sewage:\nThe tunnel was finally discovered after the DOE performed a survey on a sewage problem which turned out to be caused by a pipe Kerr had hit accidentally, causing sewage to leak into his tunnel over five years. The judge questioned Kerrs wife as to why she never smelt the sewage odours from her husband. Mrs Kerr simply shrugged.\n\"Gombeen,\" the author of the article, also provided some humorous explanations when readers questioned the authenticity of his reporting. When asked how this Irish plumber could have seen the Shawshank Redemption in 1994 when the film wasn't released in Ireland until 1995, Gombeen remarked that years work strangely in the Emerald Isle. And when queried why this man would bother digging a tunnel when he could have just walked out of the front door given that his wife was such a sound sleeper (she apparently wasn't bothered by the noise of his power tools), Gombeen averred that the floorboards in Omagh are extra squeaky:\nTyrone Tribulations frequently publishes humorous material that pokes fun at life in Ireland. Although the site does not carry a disclaimer explicitly labeling its content as satire, they do state that the accuracy of their stories \"cannot be guaranteed.\"\nWe reached out to the site to confirm that this was a bit of fiction and asked the proprietor, \"Paudge McGaudge,\" what it was like to unwittingly fool thousands of people:\nI completely made the story up -- that's what my website does ... short local fictional stories. I've written 1000s now since 2012 but that was by far the most successful. I just thought about it driving home from work and wrote it up on my kitchen table in about 20-30 mins in Sept 2014. Within days it took off. I think the big pulls were: it being read out on BBC Radio 2 during the day as a funny real story; John Cusack tweeting about it; and Buzzfeed running with it before they realised it was fake. I don't mean to catch people out and take no pleasure in doing that -- I just like writing stories to make people laugh.",

Snopes investigates the claim of an Irish man digging a tunnel to a pub, ultimately concluding it to be a false, satirical story that went viral.

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that a man in Ireland dug a tunnel from his bedroom to a local pub over 15 years, earning him the nickname \"Shawshank Husband\".  Both the internal and external checks strongly indicate that this caption is out of context with the provided image. \n\nInternal Check: The internal check finds no evidence in the image to support the caption's claims. The image depicts a sinkhole or a large hole in the ground, with no signs of a tunnel, a bedroom, a pub, or a man. This lack of visual correspondence results in a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False. \n\nExternal Check: The external check corroborates the internal check's findings with a confidence score of 10.  The external check cross-references the caption with a Snopes article. This article explicitly debunks the story presented in the caption, classifying it as a false, satirical narrative that went viral. Snopes provides strong evidence showing the story's origin, its spread across various websites (before being retracted by most), and its ultimate classification as a fabricated tale. This aligns perfectly with the internal check, which found no visual evidence to support the caption. \n\nDiscrepancy Analysis: There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both independently and strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context concerning the given image. The high confidence score (10) from the external check is due to the definitive evidence from the Snopes article, effectively verifying that the claim is fictional. This reinforces the internal check's assessment, leading to a unified and highly confident conclusion.\n\nEntity Alignment:  The entities mentioned in the caption (a man, a tunnel, a bedroom, a pub, Ireland) are entirely absent from the image. The image only presents a sinkhole, which is completely unrelated to the narrative of a man digging a tunnel. Therefore, there is zero entity alignment.\n\nUncertainty Analysis: There is no uncertainty in this assessment. Both the internal visual check and the external fact-checking produce strong, consistent evidence to reject the caption's accuracy relative to the image. The high confidence score reflects this certainty.\n\nConclusion: Based on the lack of visual evidence in the image (internal check) and the definitive external fact-checking from Snopes, it is concluded with high certainty (confidence score of 10) that the caption is out of context relative to the image. The caption describes a fabricated story, while the image shows an unrelated natural phenomenon.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly confirm that the caption is out of context with the image. The internal check finds no visual evidence to support the caption's claims, while the external check uses a Snopes article to confirm the caption's story as false and satirical."

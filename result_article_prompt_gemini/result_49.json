    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows a moderate confidence (8) in the caption's accuracy, primarily because the image depicts a cow near a shop in Rajasthan. However, the photographer's name and country of origin (Elizabeth Brooks, US) are not verifiable from the image itself, leading to a reduction in the confidence score. The external check reveals a low confidence (1) because no external source supports the caption's claim.  The significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks necessitates a low overall confidence score. The lack of corroborating evidence from external sources strongly suggests that the caption's details about the photographer and their location are likely inaccurate. While the image does depict a cow near a building that could be a tailor shop, this alone is insufficient to verify the caption's claim.  To improve the caption's accuracy, more information about the context of the photograph is needed, such as verifiable details about the photographer and the location, along with evidence confirming the building is a tailor shop. In conclusion, the absence of external validation and the uncertainty surrounding the photographer's information lead to a low confidence that the caption aligns with reality, hence classifying it as out of context.  Without further evidence, asserting the caption's accuracy is unreliable.  The conflict between internal and external checks necessitates this assessment, emphasizing the importance of cross-referencing information across multiple sources before concluding accuracy. The image's content only partially supports the caption; therefore, based on all available evidence, the caption is considered out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows moderate confidence in the image's depiction of a cow near a shop in Rajasthan, but cannot verify photographer details.  External check finds no supporting evidence, resulting in low confidence and OOC classification."

      "explanation": "The claim is plausible.  Donald Trump's inauguration was in January 2017, and it included various associated events like the Liberty Ball.  Serhiy Kivalov was a Ukrainian lawmaker, and it's possible he attended such an event. However, without a source for the Facebook image, verification is needed. The date is consistent with the inauguration timeframe.",

  },
  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy because all entities mentioned (Serhiy Kivalov, Liberty Ball, Trump's inauguration) are present in the image. The external check also supports the claim (confidence 8), noting the plausibility of a Ukrainian lawmaker attending the event given the historical context. While there is no explicit source for the Facebook image, the date aligns with the inauguration timeframe.  The minor discrepancy in confidence scores between the internal and external checks is likely due to the absence of a definitive source for the image in the external check. However, both checks concur on the overall accuracy of the caption, leading to a high combined confidence score. There are no significant conflicts or discrepancies. The external check's point about the possibility of foreign officials attending the event strengthens the claim's plausibility. The entity analysis confirms that the entities and their relationships are accurately represented in the caption. Overall, the evidence strongly supports the caption's accuracy; the claim is considered factual with a high degree of certainty based on the available evidence.  The absence of an explicit image source is the primary limitation, but the consistency of the claim with historical events and the image content outweighs this limitation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with high confidence scores.  The slight difference in confidence scores is due to the lack of a definitive source for the image.  There are no significant discrepancies; the evidence strongly suggests the caption is not out of context."

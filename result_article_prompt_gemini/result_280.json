In this case, the pictured \"Elena Travis\" was actually a Getty Images stock photograph labeled \"Happy Patient.\"\nWNDR includes a disclaimer stating that all of their content is fictional:\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.

The site includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says: World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\nThe made-up story, though, received more than 500,000 interactions on Facebook, including 47,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. It was also shared on YouTube and 4chan, an open, image-sharing forum, without the disclaimer. Some 4chan users commented that it was fake, but comments by others indicated that some thought it was real.\nThe bogus story states that Elena Travis, who is described as a 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist, officially broke the world record after receiving her 27th abortion. The photos that accompany the story are actually stock photos from Getty Images.\nAside from the misidentified photos and a disclaimer at the bottom of the story, there are other indications that the story is false. There is no byline on the story and the clinic mentioned as performing the historic operation does not seem to exist. A Google search for Sacramento Street Health Center yielded no results.\nWeve written once before about World News Daily Report and have included the website in our Misinformation Directory, which lists websites that spread misinformation on the internet.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\nA 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist has officially broken a world record after receiving her 27th abortion.

    "explanation": "The original caption, \"Pro-Choice Activist proudly breaks world record by getting her 27th abortion\", is demonstrably false and completely out of context with the provided image.  Both internal and external validation checks strongly support this conclusion.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check reveals a complete mismatch between the image and the caption. The image shows a woman in a hospital bed, possibly recovering from a medical procedure. There is no visual evidence suggesting she is a pro-choice activist or that she has undergone any abortion procedure, let alone 27 of them. The lack of visual cues related to the claim makes the caption entirely incongruent with the image's context. The internal check gives a confidence score of 0, indicating no support for the caption's claim.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation utilizes fact-checking resources, Snopes and FactCheck.org, which independently debunk the narrative presented in the caption.  Both sources identify the original story as originating from a satirical website, World News Daily Report.  They specifically highlight the use of a stock photo (likely the one provided), the absence of any verifiable evidence supporting the claim, and the website's disclaimer explicitly stating the fictional nature of its content. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check confirms the fabricated nature of the caption.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is no discrepancy between the internal and external validation results. Both checks concur that the caption is inaccurate and unrelated to the image.  The lack of support from both visual content analysis (internal) and reputable fact-checking websites (external) reinforces the conclusion.\n\nEntity Analysis:\nThe caption mentions \"Pro-Choice Activist\" and \"27th abortion.\"  These entities are absent from the image. The image displays only a woman in a hospital bed, providing no information about her beliefs, actions, or medical history. The absence of these entities further supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.\n\nConclusion:\nThe overwhelming evidence from both internal and external validation checks, combined with the entity analysis, strongly indicates that the original caption is entirely fabricated and out of context. The image does not in any way support the information presented in the caption. The claim is a hoax, and linking it to the image is misleading. Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context with a high confidence score of 10.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute the original caption.  The image provides no support for the claim, and fact-checking websites confirm the story's fictional nature.  There is a complete lack of alignment between the image and the caption's narrative."

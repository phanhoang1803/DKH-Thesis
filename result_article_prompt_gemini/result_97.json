The caption mentions \"Abidjan's residents\" and \"anti-coronavirus hygiene measures.\" While the mural clearly relates to the coronavirus and hygiene measures (the mask), the location (Abidjan) is not directly depicted in the image. I am assuming Abidjan is the location based on the caption, hence the confidence score is reduced.",

      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  Public health campaigns using murals to promote hygiene practices are common, especially during health crises like the coronavirus pandemic. Abidjan, being a major city, would likely have such campaigns. The caption doesn't present anything inherently implausible. However, without specific evidence of such a mural existing in Abidjan, there's a degree of uncertainty.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate, although neither provides definitive proof.  The internal check highlights that while the mural's theme (coronavirus hygiene) aligns with the caption, the location (Abidjan) isn't explicitly shown in the image. The confidence score is lowered due to this missing visual evidence of the location. The external check supports the plausibility of the caption by pointing out the common use of murals in public health campaigns, especially in urban areas like Abidjan. However, it acknowledges the lack of concrete evidence confirming the existence of this specific mural in Abidjan. Both checks independently arrive at a confidence score of 8. While the image shows a mural clearly advocating for coronavirus hygiene, the lack of explicitly identifying information regarding the mural's location is the main factor limiting the overall confidence. There is no direct conflict between the internal and external checks; they both highlight the same uncertainty related to the location claim. The image itself strongly suggests a public health campaign mural relating to coronavirus and mask-wearing. The mention of Abidjan in the caption adds contextual information that isn't visually verifiable from the image alone.  Therefore, the conclusion leans towards accepting the caption's claim as plausible but not definitively confirmed due to the missing location information. More evidence would be needed to achieve a higher confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is plausible but lack definitive evidence to confirm the mural's location in Abidjan.  The core message of the caption aligning with the mural's imagery is strongly supported, but uncertainty around the location results in a lower confidence score."

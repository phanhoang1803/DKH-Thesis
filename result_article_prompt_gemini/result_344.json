        "content": "A police officer and a civilian have been killed in the Nigerian city of Lagos as protests continue against police brutality for a sixth day.\nThere are reports that police used live ammunition on the protesters in the country's largest city.\nThis comes a day after a notorious police unit accused of unlawful arrests and murder was officially disbanded.\nDemonstrators have long called for the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) to be broken up.\nBut they remain unhappy following Sunday's announcement that officers are being redeployed to other units rather than being disciplined.\nEyewitnesses say there were multiple casualties among protesters after police opened fire on them in the Surulere area of Lagos on Monday, the BBC's Ishaq Khalid reports from the capital, Abuja.\nSome of the demonstrators reportedly threw stones at the police. The police say one officer was killed and two others were critically injured by what they called ''armed protesters''.\nMeanwhile, Lagos police and protesters blame each other for the death of a 55-year-old man.\nAn aide to President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the use of live bullets on demonstrators by the police. There are reports that armed trucks have been deployed to Lagos airport to break up protests blocking access to the airport.\nEarlier, the president promised \"extensive\" police reforms and said Sars officers responsible for human rights violations would be brought to justice.\nBut the latest alleged use of live bullets by the police on protesters could further anger campaigners and lend more credence to their grievances, our correspondent says.\nIn Monday's video address, President Buhari said disbanding Sars was \"only the first step\" in a range of reforms, but added that police officers were hard-working, and the reputation of the force should not be tarnished by a \"few bad eggs\".\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose accept and continue.\nThere are also fears that if thousands of Sars officers were dismissed at once, they could pose a security threat.\nActivists say the abuses carried out during the protests - including beatings, intimidation and the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators - were all carried out by policemen who did not belong to Sars.\nThey say a total overhaul of policing in Nigeria is needed.\nOver the weekend, protests against Sars spread to Europe and Canada after reports of unlawful arrests, torture and shootings.\nWhat do the protesters want?\n#EndSARS campaigners have circulated a list of five key demands to bring about reform. These are:\nThe immediate release of all arrested protesters\nJustice for those killed by police brutality and compensation for their families\nAn independent body to investigate and prosecute misconduct\nIndependent psychological assessments and new training for dismissed Sars officers who want redeployment\nA pay rise for police so they are \"adequately compensated for protecting lives and property of citizens\"\nHow did Sars operate?\nThe latest round of protests were prompted by footage of officers pulling two men out of a hotel in Lagos into the street and shooting one of them.\nThe footage, leaked to the media, provoked outrage and led many to share stories of brutality attributed to the unit, which has developed notoriety for unduly profiling young people, the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja says.\nThose considered \"flashy\" often attract the Sars officers' attention and very few walk away without having to hand over money, while others are arrested or jailed on trumped-up charges and some have been killed, our correspondent adds.\nEarlier this year, rights group Amnesty said it had documented at least 82 cases of torture, ill treatment and extra-judicial execution between January 2017 and May this year.\nThe victims were mainly men aged between 18 and 35 from poor backgrounds and vulnerable groups. Many of those tortured were beaten with sticks and machetes and denied medical attention, the group said.\nThe \"systemic use of torture... points to an absolute disregard for international human rights laws and standards\", Amnesty said.\nWhy didn't reform work?\nThe #EndSARS hashtag was first thought to have been used in 2018, but it emerged once again a week ago.\nDecember 2017: Outcry prompts Nigeria's then-police chief, Ibrahim Idris, to order an immediate re-organisation of the anti-robbery unit in the aftermath of a viral video showing a young man allegedly killed by police\nAugust 2018: Acting President Yemi Osinbajo orders an overhaul of Sars, wanting a new unit whose officers would wear proper identification while on duty. He also asks the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria to create a special panel to investigate previous wrongdoing by Sars\nJanuary 2019: Newly appointed Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu announces a comprehensive reform of Sars and temporarily decentralises the unit. Rights group Amnesty says the reforms do not go far enough for citizens to trust the police\nFebruary 2020: Police boss Mohammed Adamu gives instructions to disband Sars' satellite offices",

    "explanation": "The internal check provides strong evidence supporting the caption's claim. The image clearly depicts a protest blocking a road leading to an airport, aligning with the caption's description of the event. The external check further strengthens the claim, corroborating the occurrence of protests at the Lagos airport during the specified time frame. While the external source doesn't mention the exact date (Oct. 12), its report about protests blocking access to the airport aligns with the caption's core message. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 for internal and 8 for external) solidify the assessment. There are no significant discrepancies between internal and external findings; both point towards the caption accurately reflecting the event depicted in the image. The overall assessment aligns with the available evidence, suggesting a high probability that the caption correctly represents the context of the image. No conflicts arise between internal and external checks. The high confidence level stems from the clear visual evidence (image) and the corroborating external reporting about the protests at the Lagos airport during the relevant period. The slight uncertainty concerning the precise date of the protest in the external source is mitigated by the strong visual evidence and the overall alignment of the event with news reports. Given the alignment of the event with the context, the conclusion that the caption is not out of context is valid. The confidence score is set at 9 considering the corroborating evidence and minor uncertainty in the exact date mentioned in the external source.  The validation summary highlights the strong agreement between internal and external checks, pointing to the accuracy of the caption in reflecting the depicted event.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The image clearly shows a roadblock protest at what seems to be a Lagos airport access road.  External sources corroborate the occurrence of such protests at the Lagos airport during the relevant timeframe."

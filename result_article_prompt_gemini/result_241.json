        "content": "Walz tells Jimmy Kimmel that election is a chance to 'turn the page' on denials about 2020 result\nWalz on Jimmy Kimmel Live! celebrated his time as a teacher  and lunchroom monitor, sharing a story about performing the Heimlich maneuver on a choking student.\nI got lunchroom duty every year after that, said Walz, a former high school teacher. He joked that on lunchroom duty, \"youre an optimist or youre dead.\"\nKimmel played clips of Trump denying that he and his running mate, JD Vance, are weird, a label Walz has used to describe them.\nIf you have to tell people numerous times that youre not weird, you might be weird, Walz said.\nWalz also made a comment that was seized upon by Kimmel for a quick joke. In discussing Vances non-answer during their recent debate about whether Vance believed Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, Walz stumbled into territory he did not intend.\nLook, we get to turn the page on that. And I plan on waking up on Nov. 6th with Madame President, he said.\nKimmel pressed as the audience laughed: I want to be clear: You wont be waking up together  unless you two guys have gotten closer than we thought.\nWalz laughed and said, I have a problem about not being specific with my language.\nWalz opened his interview on a serious note, saying that his heart and the hearts of many Americans were heavy Monday on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, which killed more than 1,200 people. Israel responded with a war in Gaza that has killed more than 41,000 people there, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.\nThe vice president and I talked about it today, about making sure that it never happens again, that Israel is secure and the hostages are brought home and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza ends, Walz said.\nWhat the 2024 polls show with four weeks to go\nWith four weeks to go until Election Day, the polls continue to show a presidential race that remains on a knifes edge  and well within the margin of error.\nThats true for recent national polls like NPR/PBS/Marists, which found Harris with a narrow edge against Trump  2 points among likely voters, 50% to 48%, within the polls margin of error (plus or minus 3.7 percentage points).\nIts also true in the polls of the battleground states that will ultimately decide the presidential contest.\nRead the full story here.\nMusk to make voter push for Trump in Pennsylvania during final weeks of campaign\nand\nElon Musk will intensify an effort to get out the vote for Trump in the final four weeks ahead of Election Day, a source familiar with the effort confirmed to NBC News.\nPolitico first reported on Musk's plans, which will include stops with the support of his own pro-Trump super PAC, America PAC.\nMusk appeared at a Pittsburgh Steelers game yesterday sporting a MAGA hat. He said he may also make additional stops in the state separate from his super PAC, the source confirmed.\nHarris campaign targets voter registration at college campuses in battleground states\nand\nThe Harris-Walz campaign is launching ads and sending text messages targeting students on college campuses in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nIn details first shared with NBC News, the campaign said its outreach includes ads in student newspapers and on school websites encouraging students to register to vote. The campaign did not disclose a dollar figure for the new ads but said it has spent six figures on campus advertising since the start of the semester.\nAccording to the campaign, text messages were sent today to hundreds of thousands of students in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, notifying them about voter registration deadlines. More texts are expected to be sent in other states as Election Day draws closer, the campaign said.\nThe Supreme Court has begun its new term and has agreed to take up cases about gender-affirming care, ghost guns and the death penalty, among others. NBC News Lawrence Hurley has details about what cases the court is scheduled to hear and its decision to decline to hear a Biden administration appeal over emergency room abortion care.\nTrump asks to autograph prayer book during visit to rabbis' gravesite\nand\nDuring a visit to Ohel Chabad-Lubavitch, a gravesite of prominent rabbis in New York, Trump picked up a siddur, or prayer book, which is not traditionally used for autographs, and asked, \"Would you like me to sign this?\"\nA rabbi responded saying, Its yours,\" to which Trump replied, \"Its mine? How lovely, thank you.\nThe visit was part of an event to mark the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.\nElon Musks mother, Maye, appears to encourage voter fraud in X post\nElon Musks mother, Maye Musk, appeared to encourage a form of voter fraud in a post on X.\nThe Democrats have given us another option. You dont have to register to vote, Musks mother wrote in the post Saturday. On Election Day, have 10 fake names, go to 10 polling booths and vote 10 times. Thats 100 votes, and its not illegal. Maybe we should work the system too.\nMusk called the post sarcastic in response to criticism and didnt delete it.\nRead the full story here.\nWalz says Harris told him to be 'a little more careful on how you say things'\nWalz said in an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" that Harris has told him to be \"a little more careful\" about how he says things.\nHis remarks came in response to a question about a time that they have disagreed on something.\n\"Well, I  she'd probably disagree with  she said, 'Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say things,' whatever it might be,\" Walz told CBS News' Bill Whitaker.\nDuring last week's vice presidential debate, Walz admitted that he \"misspoke\" when he said he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. He has also come under scrutiny over remarks tied to his military service.\nWalz said at the debate that he can be a \"knucklehead\" sometimes.\nIn the CBS News interview, Walz said, \"I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word.\"\nHarris says more needs to be done on immigration in '60 Minutes' interview\nIn a taped interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" that aired tonight, Harris defended her record on immigration while acknowledging more steps need to be taken.\nAsked about her recent embrace of Biden's tough-on-migration policies and why those policies weren't enacted earlier, Harris cited an immigration bill introduced at the beginning of the Biden administration and a bipartisan border security bill from this year. Neither measure made it to Biden's desk, and Senate Republicans blocked the more recent bill after Trump voiced his opposition to it.\n\"A bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with the border security bill,\" Harris said. \"Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress: 'Kill the bill. Dont let it move forward.'\"\nUnder the Biden administration, the number of arrivals of undocumented immigrants rose steeply before coming down significantly in recent months. Pressed on whether it was a mistake to loosen immigration policies to the point that border crossings quadrupled earlier in the administration, Harris called it a \"long-standing problem\" and said Congress needs to be able to act to \"fix the actual problem.\"\nMusks PAC offers $47 payouts to refer swing-state voters to sign petition\nElon Musks pro-Trump America PAC is offering people $47 if they get one registered swing-state voter to sign a petition supporting the First and Second amendments of the Constitution.\nEasy money, Musk said in a post about the initiative.\nThe payout offer appears to be a way to financially encourage voter registration of people who might prefer Trump in swing states. Paying people directly to register to vote is illegal, but America PACs petition appears to skirt laws that forbid certain types of election-related payments, paying referrers of registered voters, instead.\nMusk and America PAC have vocally encouraged swing-state voter registration ahead of the mandatory deadlines.\nRead the full story here.\nMontana GOP Senate candidate says women have been indoctrinated on abortion\n+3\n, , and\nMontana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, who is locked in a highly consequential race with Democratic incumbent Jon Tester, said in newly unearthed audio that the Republican Party needs to do a better job at winning over young women, who he said have been indoctrinated for years on the issue of abortion.\nYoung people, listen up, theyve been indoctrinated for too long. We dont even try to talk to them anymore, Sheehy said at an event in late 2023, according to audio obtained by NBC News.\nI sat with a group of younger folks a couple of months ago talking about, just, various issues. And one of them was life, because of course young women between the age of 19 and 30, abortion is their Number One concern. Thats all they want to talk about. They are single-issue voters, Sheehy continued.\nRead the full story here.\nGeorgia Supreme Court reinstates states 6-week abortion ban\nThe Georgia Supreme Court today reinstated the states six-week abortion ban while it reviews the states appeal of a lower court ruling that had struck down the law.\nThe decision goes into effect at 5 p.m. local time, meaning most abortions will again be illegal in the state after six weeks of pregnancy after that time.\nThe state Supreme Court decision, however, left in place the lower courts ruling blocking a separate provision of the law that had given state prosecutors broad access to the medical records of abortion patients without due process protections.\nRead the full story here.\nNBC News contributor and Indigenous journalist Alyssa London reports from the White Mountain Apache Reservation, where Native American volunteers are helping voters overcome the obstacles to casting ballots in November.\nHarris accuses Trump of pushing misinformation about hurricane relief\nand\nAs recovery efforts around Hurricane Helene continue, Harris today accused Trump of spreading misleading information about the Federal Emergency Management Agency resources available to victims.\n\"There's a lot of mis- and disinformation being pushed out there by the former president about what is available, in particular to the survivors of Helene,\" Harris said. \"And first of all, its extraordinarily irresponsible.\"\nThe reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now, and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go,\" Harris said.\nThe storms death toll has risen to 227, making it the deadliest hurricane since Katrina in 2005.\nRead more here.\nNorth Carolina gives counties affected by Hurricane Helene voting flexibility\nNorth Carolinas election board voted today to give residents in the western part of the state, which was hit hardest by Hurricane Helene, greater flexibility to vote by mail and run their elections.\nVoters in 13 counties heavily affected by the storm will have more ways to obtain and deliver absentee ballots, while county boards will have more authority to modify their election administration plans. The changes, approved by unanimous vote of the bipartisan board, come 10 days before early voting begins in the battleground state and as mail voting is already underway.\nVoters in those counties who want to cast ballots by mail will be able to request and receive them in person until Nov. 4, the day before Election Day, rather than the Tuesday before, under the usual rules. They will also be able to drop off their ballots at any county board of elections in the state or any polling sites in their counties. Previously, voters were limited to dropping absentee ballots off at the board of elections or early voting sites in their counties.\nRead the full story here.\nHarris and Emhoff take part in tree-planting ceremony observing Oct. 7 attack\nand\nHarris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff took part in a pomegranate tree-planting ceremony this afternoon in observation of the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.\nWe dedicate this tree to the 1,200 innocent souls, in an act of pure evil on Oct. 7, 2023, who were massacred by Hamas terrorists, Harris said.\nThe theme of her remarks was inspired by Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, the Jewish philosopher, with Harris referring to his quotation, Religion begins with a consciousness that something is asked of us.\nWhat is asked of us? We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of Oct. 7 can ever happen again. And on this solemn day, I will restate my pledge to always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world, she said, adding she will work to reunite the hostages held in Gaza with their families.\nHarris also reiterated her efforts to end the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians.\nWhat is asked of us? We must uphold the commitment to repair the world, an idea that has been passed on throughout generations of the Jewish people and across many faiths. And to that end, we must work to relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year,\" Harris said.\nAsked by NBC News whether its possible to get a cease-fire deal before the Nov. 5 general election, Harris said the Biden administration would continue to do all it can to get cease-fire and hostage deals done.\nEmhoff, who is Jewish, spoke to the pain felt by Jews around the world amid the somber anniversary.\nAs we gather here today on what was the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust, I am still filled with pain and despair, Emhoff said, adding that the pain of the attack remains \"as raw as it did one year ago.\"\nVance calls on Biden and Harris to secure the release of Israeli hostages\nand\nIn remarks at the Philos Projects Oct. 7 rally at the National Mall in Washington, Vance called on Biden and Harris to secure the release of hostages captured by Hamas in its attack on Israel a year ago.\nIt is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who havent done a thing, he said. Vice President Harris, our message is bring them home. Use your authority to help bring them home.\nVance also condemned pro-Palestinian protests in the U.S., saying the chant from the river to the sea is a disgraceful slogan that is going to lead to the genocide of millions of people.\nBiden has repeatedly stated that Israel has a right to defend itself, that his administration continues to negotiate the release of hostages and that it is working to secure a cease-fire deal in Gaza to end the war.\nRon DeSantis is refusing to take Harris call on Hurricane Helene\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is not taking calls from Harris about storm recovery just over a week after Hurricane Helene hammered parts of his state.\nA source familiar with the situation said he was dodging Harris calls because they seemed political, according to a DeSantis aide.\nKamala was trying to reach out, and we didnt answer, the DeSantis aide told NBC News.\nThe same person said not to my knowledge when asked whether DeSantis had spoken to Biden.\nRead the full story.\nTrump campaign event in Florida postponed because of hurricane\nand\nThe Trump campaign said it was postponing Trump's \"roundtable at the Latino summit\" tomorrow because of the dire weather forecasts in Florida.\nThe event had been scheduled for 11 a.m. at the Trump Doral Miami.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with those in the path of Hurricane Milton, and we are postponing the Latino Summit as communities prepare for the storm,\" campaign adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement. She said Trump \"looks forward to rescheduling tomorrows event to foster more conversations on how we can expand the reach of the American Dream for all.\nKey Pennsylvania county to deploy drop boxes after deal reached on earlier decision to ban them\nand\nReporting from New York\nFour drop boxes will be deployed in Luzerne County  a key county in battleground Pennsylvania  after local officials and a civil rights group locked in litigation over the topic reached a settlement.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania had sued last week over the Luzerne County managers decision last month to remove all drop boxes from the county.\nCounty Manager Romilda Crocamo had cited security concerns and potential illegal activities as the reason for her move just weeks before voters starting casting ballots in the state.\nBut in an interim settlement between the ACLU of Pennsylvania and Crocamos office, Crocamo agreed to deploy the four pre-approved ballot drop boxes throughout the county while the judges take time to consider the larger questions over election authority, Vic Walczak, the ACLU of Pennsylvanias legal director, told NBC News.\nThose questions include whether it is the County manager  a nonpartisan position that is appointed by the County Council  or the county Bureau of Elections that has the power to make such decisions over drop boxes.\nThe ACLU of Pennsylvania has argued that only the Bureau of Elections and Registration has the power to decide to scrap the use of drop boxes.\nWalczak said he expected the four drop boxes to be deployed Monday. Crocamo did not respond to questions about the interim settlement.\nMany Pennsylvania counties use ballot drop boxes. Republicans in the state have tried to ban their use through litigation and legislation.\nBarack Obama carried Luzerne County twice before Trump won it in 2016 and 2020.\nBiden marks anniversary of Oct. 7 attack at White House ceremony\nand\nThe president and the first lady paid tribute to the victims of the Oct. 7 attack with a candle lighting ceremony at the White House.\nThe first couple was joined by Rabbi Aaron Alexander of Adas Israel Congregation, who spoke for the duration of the very short ceremony  first leading a prayer of remembrance in Hebrew before reciting it in English.\nGod full of mercy, who dwells on high, grant fitting rest on the wings of the divine presence to the holy and pure, the brave, for the souls of the holy ones, men, women and children who were killed on October 7, the rabbi said. \"May they rest in peace.\"\nAfter the prayer, Biden lit a candle in the middle of the table and the three had a moment of silence.\nTrump to commemorate Oct. 7 anniversary with events in New York and Florida\nand\nTrump will commemorate the anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel with a visit to Ohel Chabad Lubavitch in Queens, New York. He will also speak at an Oct. 7 remembrance event in Florida.\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, echoed Trump's claims that Biden had emboldened Iran and that the war wouldn't have happened had Trump remained in office.\nFor Americans and Israelis alike, its imperative that President Trump is re-elected so he can end the bloodshed caused by an emboldened Iranian terrorist regime, which is stronger and richer today from the Harris-Biden Administrations incompetence and weak policies, Leavitt said.\nVance and Walz to hold rallies in Tucson on Wednesday\n+2\n, and\nVance is scheduled to hold a rally in Tucson, Arizona, on Wednesday and a town hall in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday, the Trump campaign said.\nVance will visit North Carolina for the first time since Hurricane Helene devastated western parts of the state. Trump held a town hall in Fayetteville last week.\nWalz is scheduled to speak at a campaign rally in Reno, Nevada, tomorrow night.\nOn Wednesday, he will participate in an event for veterans and military families with Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Jim McCain, the son of the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, in Chandler, Arizona.\nWalz is also scheduled to take part in an event with Stephen Roe Lewis, the governor of the Gila River Indian Community, and other tribal leaders in the Phoenix area, and he will speak at a campaign rally in the Tucson area later Wednesday.\nToday is the last day to register to vote in these 10 states\nIt's the last day to register to vote for the November election in the following states: Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.\nEligible voters can check their registration status on their state's site.\nN.J. Senate candidate explains apparent medical episode during debate\nNew Jersey Republican Senate candidate Curtis Bashaw said in a statement last evening that he hadnt had a chance to eat anything after he had an apparent medical episode at the Senate debate.\n\"Thank you all for the well wishes! I was out campaigning all day, and I never stopped to get a bite to eat,\" he said. \"Excited to eat pizza with my fantastic volunteers at the post-debate party tonight!\"\nDuring the debate Bashaw appeared to lose the ability to speak and was grasping his lectern. His rival, Democrat Andy Kim, went over to Bashaw and asked whether he was OK, to which Bashaw said, Yeah. The debate then took a brief intermission, and Curtis was helped off the stage.\nWhen he returned, Bashaw appeared to have recovered.\nWith just 29 days to go until Election Day, Trump and Harris are focusing heavily on the battleground states that will decide the race for the White House. NBCs Hallie Jackson reports for \"TODAY.\"\nArtist uses typewriter to transcribe peoples thoughts to next president\nSheryl Oring spent her Monday morning dressed as a 1960s secretary outside Seward Park Library in lower Manhattan, typing out New Yorkers thoughts on the upcoming election on her vintage typewriter.\nThe performance is part of her I Wish to Say project, which aims to document Americans thoughts leading up to the election, as well as through the first 100 days of the next administration.\nTheres something revolutionary about slowing down to compose a thoughtful message to the next president on a typewriter, Oring said in a statement.\nOring began the project in 2004. She has produced more than 4,000 postcards during six presidential election cycles over the course of two decades. Oring uses carbon paper, which creates two copies of each message she types: one that is sent to the White House, and another preserved for her archive.\nAn exhibition of her work is up for display at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey.\nYim Kwok, 72, who immigrated to New York from Hong Kong in 1972, said her postcard asked for better senior care.\nOring also said many young women of color have shared messages of hope around the possibility of Harris becoming president.\nTrump says he should get '100% of the Jewish vote' in November\nIn a radio interview on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Trump said he should get 100% of the Jewish vote nationwide this fall.\nI should get 100% of the vote. No person has ever been better to the Jewish people, probably no person, period, to the Jewish people and Israel, Trump said.\nNobodys done more for the Jewish people than I have,\" he added, pointing to his administration's moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and his pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. \"Nobodys done more for Israel as a president  maybe beyond being a president.\"\nTrump has long complained about Jewish people who support Democrats. At an event focused on fighting antisemitism last month, he said that Jewish people will bear \"a lot\" of the blame if he loses the election.\nTrump to speak at far-right Christian national conference in two weeks, campaign says\n+2\n, and\nTrump is set to speak at a far-right Christian nationalist conference in two weeks organized by his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and conservative entrepreneur Clay Clark, a Trump campaign official told NBC News.\nTrump will address the gathering titled The 11th Hour Faith Leaders Meeting on Oct. 21 at the ReAwaken American Tour, Clark said, adding that other faith leaders will address the event alongside Flynn and Ben Carson, who served as housing and urban development secretary in the Trump administration.\nThe ReAwaken America Tour, co-founded by Flynn and Clark, has made stops around the country promoting far-right conspiracy theories, including those boosted by the QAnon movement.\nThe former presidents appearance will be his first at the conference. His son Eric Trump has addressed the group and the former president himself spoke to participants in a speakerphone conversation with Flynn in May of last year.\nOther Trump allies have spoken at the ReAwaken America Tour in the past, including Roger Stone, election denier and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell and former administration officials Kash Patel and Peter Navarro.\nTrump suggests migrants have 'bad genes'\nand\nIn an interview on \"The Hugh Hewitt Show\" that aired this morning, Trump criticized Harris for her policies on the southern border and suggested that migrants have \"bad genes.\"\n\"When you look at the things that she proposes, theyre so far off she has no clue. How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers,\" he said, referring to the vice president's immigration proposals.\n\"Many of them murdered far more than one person, and theyre now happily living in the United States,\" he added. \"You know now a murderer. I believe this. Its in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now they left. They had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldnt be here, that are criminals.\"\nThe figure Trump cited is misleading. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told Congress in September that there are 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide living outside of ICE detention, but three law enforcement officials told NBC News that that figure doesnt include people who were detained outside of ICE enforcement because ICE doesnt keep track of incarcerations on the state or local level. Two law enforcement officials also told NBC News that many of them crossed the border before Biden was president (including during Trumps tenure.)\nSupreme Court declines to hear Biden appeal in Texas emergency room abortion dispute\nThe Supreme Court turned away a Biden administration appeal in a dispute over emergency room abortion care in Texas, leaving in place a lower court victory for the Republican-led state.\nToday's decision, months after the court wrestled with a similar case from Idaho without reaching a conclusive decision, constitutes a setback for the Biden administration.\nThe decision leaves intact a ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of Texas on the question of whether a federal law concerning emergency room care in some cases trumps state abortion restrictions.\nThe bigger legal question remains unresolved at the national level.\nRead the full story here.\nSupreme Court turns away Musks X appeal over Trump criminal investigation\nThe Supreme Court today rejected an appeal brought by X, Elon Musks social media company, declining to decide whether prosecutors should have been able to obtain data from Trump's Twitter account without him being notified.\nThe case arose as part of special counsel Jack Smiths investigation into Trump over alleged election interference in 2020, which the Supreme Court stymied earlier this year by ruling that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts taken in office. The court left in place a ruling in favor of prosecutors.\nSmith has already obtained the data at issue in the appeal brought by X, as Twitter is now known following Musks takeover of the social media company.\nBut Xs lawyers said the Supreme Court should intervene so that prosecutors cannot take similar actions in the future without the person involved being made aware that their data is being handed over to the government. Trump himself is not involved in the case.\nRead the full story here.\nHarris sidesteps when pressed on sway U.S. has over Netanyahu in interview on CBS' '60 Minutes'\nand\nHarris sidestepped when asked whether the U.S. has any sway over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a clip of an interview to air on CBS 60 Minutes tonight on the anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel.\nThe aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel, she said. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is, without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.\nHarris said the diplomatic work that the administration does with Israeli leadership \"is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,\" which include the need for humanitarian aid, an end to the war, a deal to release the hostages and a cease-fire.\nAnd were not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,\" she said.\nPressed in a follow-up question about whether Netanyahu is listening to the U.S., the vice president said, The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.\nAsked whether the U.S. has a close ally in Netanyahu, Harris deflected, saying, I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.\nHarris vows to 'ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated'\nand\nOn the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks, Harris said she is devastated by the loss and pain of the Israeli people and vowed to work toward ensuring that the threat Hamas poses is nonexistent.\nI will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas, Harris said in a statement.\nThe vice president also vowed to never stop fighting for the release of all hostages, reiterated her stance that Israel has a right to defend itself, and called for a cease-fire deal as she lamented the lives lost in Gaza in the past year.\nHamass terrorist attack on October 7 launched a war in Gaza,\" she said. \"I am heartbroken over the scale of death and destruction in Gaza over the past yeartens of thousands of lives lost, children fleeing for safety over and over again, mothers and fathers struggling to obtain food, water, and medicine. It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people.\nHarris said she believes that a diplomatic solution can be reached between Israel and Lebanon, which she said is only path to restore lasting calm that would allow residents on both sides to return home safely.\nIn a separate statement, Biden, who is holding an Oct. 7 remembrance ceremony at the White House this morning, said he and Harris remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist, and support Israels right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and Iran. The president extended sympathies to the hostages and their families and said his administration will never give up until hostages are brought home safely.\nBiden aide joins core team to help 'finish the job,' chief of staff says\nWASHINGTON  The White House's director of political strategy and outreach, Emmy Ruiz, has been promoted to senior adviser, joining a small circle of top aides who will help Biden navigate his final four months in office.\nThe move makes Ruiz the youngest person to have that title under Biden, according to a senior administration official, who first shared the details with NBC News.\nIn her new role, Ruiz will continue her work on all things political in the home stretch before Novembers election. Now that Biden is no longer a candidate, Ruiz and the other senior advisers will work closely to determine how and where to use the president in battleground states over the next 30 days, the official said.\nShe will also continue to coordinate with the Cabinet on any political travel and engagements that they take on in the final sprint.\nRuiz has overseen the political team at the White House since Biden took office in 2021. Prior to that, she served as a political strategist to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Harris.\nShe played a key role in the White Houses 2022 midterm strategy and works closely with the Democratic National Committee and Harris campaign to ensure the Biden administration and political entities are as aligned as possible.\nEmmy is a fierce advocate for making life better for all Americans, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients told NBC News in a statement. We are lucky to have her on the core team working with the president to finish the job and advance his historic agenda.\nRuiz, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, is from the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas.\nNotre Dame Law Schools growing influence on the Supreme Court\nReporting from South Bend, Indiana\nTucked within a Gothic-style building on campus in this small town is a Catholic institution increasingly exerting conservative influence on the Supreme Court: the University of Notre Dame Law School.\nThe school counts among its former faculty Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who swapped the faux-medieval halls of one institution for the neoclassical marble columns of another in helping form the 6-3 conservative majority on the court.\nIn a trend that started before Barretts appointment but has accelerated since, the school is now having success placing both students and professors in prestigious Supreme Court clerkships.

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The image clearly depicts President Biden signing a document while Vice President Harris observes. However, the external check, while also indicating a positive verdict (True), provides a confidence score of only 8 and reveals a discrepancy. The external check references news articles commemorating the anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel, connecting the presence of President Biden and Vice President Harris to these events. While the caption mentions the \"American Rescue Plan\", the external sources focus on the anniversary commemorations, not the signing of the American Rescue Plan. This discrepancy creates a conflict. The image itself gives no clear indication of the document's content.  Therefore, we cannot definitively confirm that the caption accurately reflects the context of the *specific event* captured in the image.  The external sources strongly suggest Biden and Harris were involved in events related to the anniversary, which is consistent with their presence in the Oval Office, but there is no corroboration that this specific image is related to the American Rescue Plan signing. Considering the conflict and the lack of explicit visual confirmation of the document's content, the confidence score is lowered to 8, reflecting the uncertainty. The high internal confidence score reflects the accuracy of the image's depiction of Biden and Harris, but the external check highlights a mismatch in the specific event described in the caption and what news sources link to the image. In conclusion, while the image accurately shows Biden and Harris, the context provided by the caption—the signing of the American Rescue Plan— lacks external support from the referenced news articles. Therefore, we conclude that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image content (high confidence); External check reveals discrepancy in event context (moderate confidence). Discrepancy and lack of explicit visual confirmation lower overall confidence. Image shows Biden and Harris, but context surrounding specific event is uncertain."

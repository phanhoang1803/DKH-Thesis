        "content": "WASHINGTON  Sen. Bernie Sanders' team said on Monday that it will continue to improve its policies after staffers alleged a \"dangerous dynamic\" of \"sexual violence and harassment\" on his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\"We share in the urgency for all of us to do better,\" Sanders' Senate campaign committee, Friends of Bernie Sanders, said in a statement provided to NBC News.\nMore than two dozen men and women who worked on Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign signed a letter published by Politico that alleged an \"untenable and dangerous dynamic\" of sexual harassment and sexual violence during the campaign. The letter did not cite specific instances.\nThe signatories requested a meeting with the Vermont senator, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, and other top staffers \"for the purpose of planning to mitigate the issue in the upcoming presidential cycle.\" Organizers of the effort told Politico they did not intend for the letter to become public.\nSexism in political campaigns is nothing new, but the letter highlights the challenges Democrats will face in the #MeToo era as the race for 2020 kicks into high gear. Sanders, 77, is said to be considering another White House bid. During the last presidential primary, Sanders, an independent who ran as a Democrat, was criticized for his treatment of rival Hillary Clinton, while his more vocal supporters came to be characterized as \"Bernie Bros.\"\nSanders' campaign committee said in their statement that they wanted to allow the signatories to come forward in private and would \"honor this principle with respect to this private letter.\"\n\"Speaking generally, during 2016 there were a number of HR actions taken, and while it is not appropriate to discuss them individually, they ranged from employee counseling to immediate termination from the campaign,\" the statement said.\nThe committee also noted the \"more robust policies and processes\" implemented during Sanders' successful Senate reelection bid this year, including training and a toll free hotline for reporting incidents.\n\"Harassment of any kind is intolerable. Hearing the experiences and thoughts of individuals who worked on Bernies 2016 campaign is a vital part of our commitment to work within our progressive community to improve the lives of all people,\" the statement continued. \"And that's why we will continue to examine these policies and processes, with feedback welcome, and will make any necessary changes, as we continue our work to build a world based on social, racial and economic justice.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects the information in Source 1.  The article states that former staff members from Sanders' 2016 campaign raised concerns about sexism and harassment and that Sanders' team is planning a meeting to address these concerns.  While the caption mentions Sanders attending \"a portion\" of the meeting, the article doesn't specify the extent of his participation, but the implication is that he will be involved. The article's reliability is high as it is from a reputable news source (NBC News).",

    "explanation": "The internal check flags a discrepancy: the image shows Senator Sanders walking away, not attending a meeting as the caption states.  The external check, however, supports the caption's core assertionâ€”that a meeting regarding sexism and harassment allegations within Sanders' 2016 campaign is planned.  The external check's high confidence (8) stems from a reputable news source (NBC News) corroborating the meeting's existence and Sanders' involvement. The conflict arises because the image depicts a moment seemingly unrelated to the meeting described in the caption. While the external validation confirms the event mentioned in the caption, the image itself provides contradictory visual evidence. The internal check's low confidence (10) reflects this visual mismatch.   Given the strong external evidence supporting the meeting's occurrence, and Sanders' association with the issue, the caption isn't entirely 'out of context,' but it's misleading in its visual representation. The image and caption don't align temporally.  The caption describes a future event (Sanders' attendance at a portion of the meeting), while the image shows an unrelated event preceding the meeting.  In weighing the evidence, the strong external validation, alongside the clear visual mismatch in the image, leads to the conclusion that the caption is somewhat out of context in relation to the provided image.  The confidence score is 8 because the core information about the meeting is verifiable, but the visual representation in the image is inaccurate relative to the caption's description of Sanders' action.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check identified a mismatch between the image (Sanders leaving a location) and the caption (Sanders planning to attend a meeting). External check validated the core information of the caption (the planned meeting) using a reputable news source.  While the external evidence supports the existence of the meeting and Sanders' involvement, the visual context of the image contradicts the caption's suggestion that it depicts Sanders participating in the meeting. This results in a final assessment that the caption is out of context in relation to the image."

For me what was surprising was the colours of the orange: much, much deeper than what one would expect,\" he added.\nScientists at the foot of the volcano were filmed cooking sausages on its lava as they studied the eruption.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

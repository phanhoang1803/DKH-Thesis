The caption uses the word \"Nazi\" to describe it which is an opinion and therefore subjective.  The visual evidence does not confirm the flag is a Nazi flag, only that it visually resembles a Nazi flag, therefore making the caption's use of the word \"Nazi\" slightly inaccurate. ",

        "content": "Claim:\nOn March 31, 2021, first lady Jill Biden mispronounced the Spanish phrase, Si Se Puede, during a speech.\nRating:\nTrue\nAbout this rating\nFirst lady Jill Biden has many accomplishments, but speaking Spanish may not be one of them.\nOn March 31, 2021, she visited the Forty Acres in California, a vaccination site and a National Historic Landmark that became the first headquarters of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), a labor union for farm workers across the country. That day, she was also honoring Csar Chvez, a UFW leader and civil rights activist who died in 1993.\nAt the end of her speech, she said, Cesar Chavez understood that no matter the obstacles, when people come together united in a cause, anything is possible. Yes we can. Si se puede!\nSi se puede (see-say-PWAY-day), which translates roughly to yes, it can be done or \"yes, we can,\" was the rallying cry for the UFW in the 1970s when it was advocating for working class Latinos and the rights of farm workers.\nBut Biden mispronounced the phrase as see-say-PWOD-day as she was closing out her speech. She can be heard mispronouncing it at 2:29 at the end of the video.\nIt should be noted that this was her third use of the phrase in the same speech, and she mispronounced it only the third time she said it. The correct pronunciation of the phrase can be heard in the video below:\nThis is not the first controversy that emerged from that speech. Many also claimed that Biden was standing in front of a Nazi-inspired flag, a story we previously debunked.\nGiven the evidence of her mispronunciation, we rate this claim as True.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that Jill Biden spoke in front of a Nazi-inspired flag. Snopes, a fact-checking website, addresses this claim in an article about a different controversy surrounding a speech given by Jill Biden.  Snopes explicitly states that they previously debunked the claim that Biden was standing in front of a Nazi-inspired flag.  While the caption's claim is mentioned, it's presented within the context of a debunked claim.  The lack of additional supporting evidence from other sources lowers the confidence score.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks have cast doubt on the caption's accuracy. The internal check highlights the subjective nature of labeling the flag as \"Nazi-inspired,\" noting a visual resemblance but lacking definitive proof.  The external check references a Snopes article that explicitly debunks the claim that Jill Biden spoke in front of a Nazi-inspired flag. While the caption's claim is mentioned in the Snopes article, it's within the context of a previously debunked claim. The lack of corroborating evidence from other reputable sources further weakens the caption's credibility.  There's a consensus between the internal and external checks; both agree that the caption is likely out of context due to the lack of conclusive evidence supporting the claim that the flag is \"Nazi-inspired.\" The internal check's confidence score is 7, and the external check's confidence score is also 7. Averaging these scores, we arrive at a final confidence score of 7, indicating that there is moderate certainty in the conclusion that the caption is out of context. Speculative statements are avoided; the assessment relies solely on the provided evidence and the results of the internal and external checks. The disagreement between the image's appearance and the caption's assertion leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks agree that the caption is likely out of context.  The internal check points to the subjective interpretation of the flag's design, while the external check cites a fact-checking website debunking the claim.  The combined evidence strongly suggests the caption is inaccurate."

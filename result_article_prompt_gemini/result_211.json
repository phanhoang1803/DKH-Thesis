Some joked about this being a real video of a living triceratops, some pondered if it was possible, while others simply wondered what the heck was going on.\nFor starters, this is not a living and breathing triceratops. The rhinoceros-looking dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period  about 68 million years ago  but went extinct along with all other non-avian dinosaurs during the CretaceousPaleogene (KPg) extinction event about 66 million years ago. In other words, it would be unusual to see a living, breathing triceratops in the wild today.\nThis video actually features a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia called Mojosemi Forest Park. While we're not exactly certain how this puppet was created, a longer video from this dino-themed amusement park appears to show that this triceratops is operated possibly by two people inside of an elaborate costume:\nhttps://fb.watch/2oxNZxaLhE/\nWhile some may have taken pause when they first saw the triceratops video, other videos from Mojosemi Forest Park clearly show that dinosaurs have not actually been brought back from extinction.\nhttps://fb.watch/2oyqfR9Klr/",

The article explicitly states that in December 2020, a video of a triceratops puppet at an Indonesian theme park circulated online, generating various reactions. The Snopes article debunks the claim that the video shows a real living triceratops.  There is a perfect match between the caption and the article's description of the event and its online spread.",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check highlights the alignment between the image content (an animatronic Triceratops being unloaded in Indonesia) and the caption's description.  The external check corroborates this by referencing a Snopes article that confirms the video's online circulation in December 2020 and clarifies that it depicts a large animatronic dinosaur, not a real living triceratops.  The high confidence scores (10/10 for both checks) indicate a strong agreement and eliminate any significant discrepancies.  The Snopes article provides crucial external evidence, backing up the claim that the video went viral and was misinterpreted by many online viewers as depicting a real living triceratops. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; instead, they mutually reinforce the accuracy of the caption's description of the event and its online dissemination. The caption's statement that the video \"was widely circulated online\" is accurately reflected in the external validation's reporting of hundreds of thousands of views and diverse reactions to the video.  The description of the event and its timing (December 2020) are also consistent between the caption and the external source.  The entity analysis aligns perfectly, with both sources identifying the key entities: a Triceratops (animatronic), Indonesia, a video, and its online circulation.  The caption, supported by both internal image analysis and external fact-checking from a reputable source like Snopes, provides a concise and accurate summary of the online event. Given the compelling evidence from both internal and external validation, the conclusion that the caption is not out of context is reached with high confidence (10/10).",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm the caption's accuracy.  The image shows an animatronic Triceratops being unloaded in what appears to be Indonesia.  External validation through a Snopes article verifies the video's online circulation in December 2020, clarifying that the dinosaur was animatronic and not a real living animal.  There are no discrepancies; both checks strongly support the caption's claims."

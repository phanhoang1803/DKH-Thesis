        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

      "explanation": "The news caption's core claim -- a goose sheltering a freezing puppy -- is present in the related article from Snopes.  However, Snopes casts significant doubt on the story's veracity and geographical location. The article states that the images are real, but the accompanying story about the goose being stuck to a pole and saving a puppy in Montana is suspect. Snopes traces the images to Chinese social media in 2017, suggesting the Montana and \"stuck to a pole\" details were later additions.  Therefore, while the core event (bird sheltering a puppy) is mentioned, the specific details provided in the caption are largely unverified and potentially fabricated.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that a man found a goose stuck to a pole in Montana sheltering a freezing puppy.  Internal validation finds this claim inconsistent with the image, which simply shows a goose sheltering a puppy. No pole, man, or Montana setting are visible. The internal check gives a confidence score of 0 because of this misalignment. External validation, using Snopes, confirms the core event of a goose sheltering a puppy is present in online images. However, Snopes strongly questions the additional details of the story (location, being stuck to a pole, etc.), tracing the images to Chinese social media in 2017.  The additional narrative elements around Montana and the pole appear to be later additions. Snopes gives a confidence score of 4 due to uncertainty surrounding added context.  Both internal and external checks concur that the original caption includes details that are not supported by available evidence.  The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong agreement between both validation methods in identifying the caption's inaccuracies.  The discrepancies lie in the specifics of the story: the internal check directly contradicts the specifics (pole, man, Montana) while the external check supports the core event but casts doubt on the supplementary details.  There is no conflict between these assessments; rather, they are complementary. The internal analysis focuses on a direct comparison between the image and caption, while the external analysis delves into the broader context and provenance of the images and story.  Combining both results gives us a very high degree of certainty that the caption's specific claims are unsubstantiated and are therefore out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm that the original caption is out of context. The internal check highlights inconsistencies between the image and the caption's specific details, while the external check supports the core event depicted but questions the added narrative elements."

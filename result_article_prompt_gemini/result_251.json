        "content": "CARACAS, Venezuela  Chef Carlos Pez has a long and tough road ahead after a serious case of COVID-19 that required a constant supply of oxygen. He is showing improvement, but his health is still fragile.\nPez, however, didnt receive treatment at one of Venezuelas hospitals despite appallingly low oxygen saturation levels. He was treated at his home in the capital, Caracas, because it is not easy to find a bed at a public hospital these days  the outcome of a recent increase in coronavirus cases and chronic understaffing  and he was priced out of a private facility despite having health insurance.\nHe is one of a growing number of coronavirus patients who are choosing to be cared for by health care professionals at home during their illness, even if their cases warranted hospital stays.\nI dont know what I would have done, Pez, a grill master, said, referring to the home health service. The 55-year-old is still hooked to an oxygen concentrator and has difficulty speaking.\nThe South American country has recently seen a spike in COVID-19 cases, which the government has partially attributed to a virus variant that scientists believe originated in neighboring Brazil. The increase has pushed already struggling hospitals to see more patients than at any other time during the pandemic.\nVenezuela Vice President Delcy Rodrguez on Friday said the country was facing a second wave of infections, though she did not give hospitalization figures. On Sunday, Medicos Unidos de Venezuela, an organization established to protest the longstanding shortage of medical supplies in the countrys hospitals, warned that the capacity of intensive therapies, both in public and private centers, is insufficient for the number of patients who are being admitted in serious condition and require the support of a ventilator, which can only be provided in these units.\nThe government has reported more than 151,100 coronavirus infections and 1,493 deaths related to COVID-19 since the pandemic began. But the Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Venezuela has warned about the possibility of a significant underreporting of infected people due to poor diagnostic capacity, among other factors.\nPeople who seek care at private hospitals face bills that, in cases like Pezs, can exceed $50,000 for two weeks of in-patient care. That is unaffordable for most in an economically battered nation where workers earn an average of $2 per month.\nFees for doctors who provide in-home care can bring the cost of COVID-19 treatment to about half of that of a private clinic. The terms of payment are also negotiable.\nIn this country plagued by four-digit inflation and prices that are increasingly set in dollars instead of the local currency, most health insurers are unable to cover even the cost of routine lab tests or an appointment with an internal medicine specialist. Pezs family is raising money online to cover his mounting medical bills.\nDr. Leonardo Acosta and two other physicians began offering in-home services in May. Initially, Acosta said, their patients were people who did not want to go to the clinic, not even to be tested, out of fear that authorities  complying with President Nicols Maduros order that all patients be hospitalized  would go looking for them at their homes.\nAs time went on, Acosta said, he and his colleagues began to see a little more complicated patients. Then came those like Pez, whose condition included oxygen saturation levels that dipped below 50% and warranted a stay in the hospital. But hospitalization was not an option.\nWe had to support him here, Acosta said at the home of the Pez family. The chefs room still has several bulky pieces of medical equipment, including his oxygen concentrator. During the worst of Pezs illness, Acosta said his patient was hooked up to a non-invasive ventilator.\nThe in-home medical team consists of about 15 people, including three doctors who handle complicated cases, other physicians, medical students and nurses specialized in intensive care. They offer coronavirus testing and other lab work as well as imaging and respiratory therapy services. The team members take turns monitoring patients 24/7.\nVenezuelas former minister of health and member of the non-governmental organization Red Defendamos la Epidemiologa Nacional, Jos Felix Oletta, told The Associated Press that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients recover without the need for hospitalization. On average, he said, 17% of those infected have significant symptoms, and of those, only 2% require intensive care, so you should hospitalize only 2% of the total.\nIt is convenient to make rational use of limited resources in a country that does not have the capacity to respond, Oletta said. If you compulsively force everyone who is not symptomatic or is slightly symptomatic to occupy a bed, the day you need that bed you wont have one.\nMaduro last week ordered lockdowns in Caracas and other cities to stop the spread of a variant of the coronavirus known as P1. He acknowledged Sunday that the increase in infections is also related to the easing of curfews and other measures implemented earlier in the pandemic.\nMaduro said the countrys case rate last week increased from 21 per 100,000 people to 27 per 100,000 people.\nIn the last week, we have maintained an average of 739 new cases and 456 recovered per day, after months of staying even, he said, adding that at the same time, the occupation of hospital beds is growing, but he did not give other details.\nEven before the virus variant began spreading in Venezuela, independent physicians were inundated with a mix of coronavirus and general patients. Some went from a few patients to more than 30 and had to reject up to 300 requests for their services on a daily basis.\nMedical equipment suppliers also cannot keep up with demand. Acosta said oxygen concentrators are difficult to obtain and his team is working at maximum capacity.\nThe demand for people seeking care is very high, Acosta said.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image depicts a waiting room with numerous individuals, consistent with a small clinic setting. However, the external check contradicts this with low confidence (3), stating that there's no supporting evidence in related articles about a specific clinic in San Felix, Venezuela,  related to the image's context.  The external check focuses on the broader challenges faced by Covid-19 patients in Venezuela regarding access to healthcare, emphasizing home treatment due to hospital limitations. This discrepancy highlights a significant conflict. The internal check relies solely on visual interpretation, while the external check grounds its assessment on external sources specifically mentioning details about healthcare facilities in Venezuela. Given the low confidence of the external check and the lack of external corroboration for the clinic's location, the caption is considered out of context.  The absence of any other identifying information in the image (e.g., clinic signage) further weakens the internal check's assessment. Therefore, despite the internal check's high confidence, the lack of external validation and the conflict between the two checks lead to a lower overall confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",

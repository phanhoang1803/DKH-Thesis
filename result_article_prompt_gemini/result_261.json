The presence of an electric fence is not clearly visible.",

      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  Giraffes are found in Kenya, and electric fences are sometimes used near protected areas to deter animals from straying onto roads or farmland. Amboseli National Park, Chyulu Hills, and Tsavo are known protected areas in Kenya. The existence of a wildlife corridor linking these areas is also consistent with conservation efforts in the region. However, without further verification, the precise location and the specific date cannot be definitively confirmed. The image's existence and the caption's accuracy in the time and date need independent verification.",
      "supporting_points": "The presence of giraffes in Kenya, the use of electric fences near wildlife corridors, and the existence of Amboseli National Park, Chyulu Hills and Tsavo protected areas are all well-established facts.  The description of a wildlife corridor linking them is consistent with conservation strategies in the region. However, the specific date and the exact details of the event require independent verification from news sources or photographic evidence.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both largely support the caption's accuracy, resulting in a final verdict of 'not out of context'.  However, there are some limitations. The internal check notes that while the image shows a giraffe crossing a road, it doesn't explicitly show an electric fence. This absence of visual confirmation of the fence creates some uncertainty. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the caption's details, emphasizing that the existence of wildlife corridors, electric fences in such areas, and the geographic locations mentioned are consistent with known facts.  However, it points out that the exact location and date remain unconfirmed without further verification.  Both checks assign a confidence score of 8, indicating a significant degree of certainty, but acknowledge limitations.  The core elements of the caption—a giraffe crossing a road in a wildlife corridor area of Kenya—are strongly supported by both checks.  The detail about the electric fence remains unconfirmed due to lack of visual evidence in the image itself.  This is the key point of discrepancy, affecting the overall confidence score, which is set at 8 to reflect this uncertainty.  The lack of a precise date in the image further supports a cautious confidence assessment. Although the existence of the described location and circumstances is highly likely, the specifics mentioned in the caption require more corroborating evidence to achieve absolute certainty.  In summary, while the caption is highly plausible based on the available evidence, some aspects cannot be definitively confirmed without additional information, so the score is adjusted accordingly. The lack of explicit visual verification of an electric fence is a key limitation, though such fences are common in this setting.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, but with limitations. The absence of a visible electric fence in the image reduces confidence.  External verification supports the general context and plausibility, but cannot independently confirm specific date and location. Overall, the caption is considered not out of context, but with a moderated confidence score."

        "content": "The president won about 73% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, Moise Katumbi, on 18%, officials said.\nThe 20 December election was marred by widespread logistical problems.\nIt had to be extended to a second day in some parts of the vast country.\nAbout two-thirds of polling stations opened late, while 30% of voting machines did not work on the first day of the vote, according to an observer group.\nMillions of people waited for hours before they were able to vote, while some gave up and went home.\nThe opposition said the problems were part of a deliberate plan to allow the results to be rigged in favour of Mr Tshisekedi, 60.\nSeveral of the main challengers have called for protests after Sunday's announcement.\n\"We call on our people to take to the streets en masse after the proclamation of the electoral fraud,\" they said in a joint statement.\nThe army has been deployed in various parts of the capital, Kinshasa, to prevent any unrest, while Mr Tshisekedi's supporters have taken to the streets to celebrate.\nThe head of the election commission has previously said the opposition candidates wanted a new election because \"they know they lost... they are bad losers\".\nElection chief Denis Kadima acknowledged some irregularities but insisted that the results reflected the will of the Congolese people.\nPresident Tshisekedi will be sworn in for a second term on 20 January.\nThe son of veteran opposition leader tienne Tshisekedi, the president was first elected in 2019.\nThat followed a poll which some observers, including the influential Catholic Church, said was won by former oil executive Martin Fayulu. He came third in this election with 5% of the vote.\nNone of the other 16 candidates gained more than 1% of the vote.\nMr Kadima said turnout was about 43% of the 41 million registered voters.\nIt is not clear if any of the 18 opposition candidates will challenge the results in court. Mr Katumbi has already said it is not worth it, because the courts are not independent.\nThe Constitutional Court has 10 days to hear any legal challenges before it is due to announce the final results on 10 January 2024.\nDR Congo is roughly four times the size of France, but lacks basic infrastructure. Even some of its main cities are not linked by road.\nAbout two-thirds of the country's 100 million population live below the poverty line, earning $2.15 (1.70) a day or less.\nVoters also chose parliamentary, provincial and municipal representatives, with about 100,000 candidates in total.\nDuring the campaign, Mr Tshisekedi repeatedly lashed out at Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, who he accuses of backing the M23 rebel group which has seized territory in the east of the country. Rwanda has repeatedly denied the charges.\nIn his last election rally, Mr Tshisekedi vowed to declare war on Rwanda, although observers dismissed this as rhetoric aimed at whipping up nationalist sentiment.\nThe elections were not held in parts of the east because of the fighting which has raged in the area for the past three decades. Some seven million people have been forced from their homes - more than in any other country except Sudan.",

The timeframe aligns with the caption's reference to Thursday. The BBC is a generally reliable news source, adding to the confidence in this assessment.

    "explanation": "The internal check expresses uncertainty due to the lack of explicit information within the image itself linking it to Felix Tshisekedi, Kinshasa, or a specific Thursday.  The image shows a celebratory street scene at night, but this is not sufficient to confirm the caption's details.  However, the external check provides strong evidence supporting the caption's claim.  Source 1, from a reliable news source (BBC), directly states that Tshisekedi's supporters celebrated in the streets of Kinshasa following election results. This aligns with the depicted scene of jubilant people in a street setting at night.  The high confidence score from the external check (8) outweighs the internal check's low confidence (0).  The external evidence provides a strong contextual basis for the caption, resolving the discrepancy between the internal and external validation results.  Although the image alone doesn't definitively confirm the caption's details, the external source strengthens the likelihood that the image depicts the described event.  Therefore, while the image lacks explicit details to independently verify the caption, the corroborating evidence from a reputable news source makes it highly probable that the caption accurately reflects the image's context. There is no evidence suggesting contradictory information, and the temporal reference ('Thursday') in the caption is consistent with the timeframe of election reporting.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags insufficient image details for verification. External check strongly supports caption based on a reliable news source reporting Tshisekedi supporters' celebrations in Kinshasa.  The external evidence outweighs the internal uncertainty, leading to a conclusion that the caption is likely accurate."

Hawns shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse search of the image shows it to be doctored, and PolitiFact previously reported on this same photo in November 2018, rating it Pants on Fire.\nThe original photo was taken in September 2015, while the two actors were walking in Los Angeles, according to an article from PopSugar. The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russells shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts.

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

The Facebook page that posted the photo did not immediately respond to a message asking for evidence for its claim.\nAn image search shows the photo is doctored.\nThe photo was taken of the couple years ago while Hawn and Russell were out in Los Angeles, according to a September 2015 PopSugar article. They can be seen walking together, holding hands and wearing the same outfits the altered photo shows them in  only without American flags or references to Trump or ISIS on their white shirts.\nIts not the first time Russell has been tied to Trump in viral social media posts.

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) and concludes that the caption accurately reflects the image content.  However, the external check, also with a high confidence score (10), contradicts this assessment.  The external check cites three reliable sources (PolitiFact and Snopes) that explicitly debunk the image as a digitally fabricated hoax.  These sources provide evidence that the original photograph predates the Trump campaign and that the actors were wearing different shirts.  The external evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the image, and consequently the caption, is misrepresenting the reality of the situation.  The discrepancy between the internal and external checks is significant. The internal check is based on a visual inspection of the manipulated image, while the external check relies on reliable fact-checking resources that have investigated the image's authenticity. Because the external verification involves credible sources with detailed evidence of image manipulation, its assessment is given significantly higher weight.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context, with a high confidence level. The internal check's high score is attributed to its limitation of analyzing only the presented image, without considering its authenticity.  The conflicting results highlight the critical need for external verification in caption validation tasks, especially when dealing with potentially manipulated images.  In this case, the external evidence definitively proves the caption inaccurate, overriding the internal visual analysis. The overwhelming evidence of manipulation and confirmed hoax status leads to a definitive conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence that the caption accurately reflects the image. However, external check, also with high confidence, shows the image is digitally fabricated and the caption is false. External verification overrides the internal check due to credible source evidence."

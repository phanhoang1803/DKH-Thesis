      "explanation": "Don Moen is a known Christian music artist.  While his touring schedule is not publicly known in detail far in advance, it is plausible that he might perform in Kigali. However, without confirmation from official sources (his website, promoters, news outlets in Rwanda), the claim remains unverified. The lack of specific dates also contributes to uncertainty.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Internal consistency check reveals strong alignment between the image (Don Moen performing) and the caption's assertion that he will perform. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of Don Moen performing in Kigali, given his career as a globally known Christian music artist, but notes the lack of publicly available information to definitively confirm the specific event mentioned in the caption. While there's no direct evidence contradicting the caption, the absence of corroborating information from official sources reduces the overall confidence level. The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty: the internal check is highly confident in the image-caption alignment, while the external check highlights the absence of conclusive proof for the specific Kigali performance. This is addressed by a moderate confidence score (8 out of 10) that reflects a balanced assessment.  Given the general nature of the caption (mentioning a future performance without specifying exact dates or venues), it is possible the statement is based on planned but not yet publicly announced events. Thus, the caption is not considered entirely out of context, but the lack of publicly verifiable details results in a cautious evaluation.  The high internal consistency (identifying Don Moen correctly) and the plausible external scenario (international performance by a well-known musician) support the overall conclusion but also highlight the importance of caution in the absence of explicit confirmation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports caption's accuracy, while external check finds the claim plausible but unverified due to lack of concrete evidence.  Overall, the caption is not deemed out of context, but confidence is lowered due to absence of readily available corroboration."

        "content": "New Delhi CNN \nMore than 63 million people in India may have contracted Covid-19, health authorities said on Tuesday  about 10 times higher than the official reported figures.\nA national survey of more than 29,000 people across 700 villages and wards found that about one in 15 people above the age of 10 had antibodies against the coronavirus, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The survey was conducted from mid-August to mid-September.\nAntibody tests, also known as serology tests, check for proteins called antibodies in the immune system, which indicate if someone has been exposed to the virus.\nOf the countrys 1.3 billion citizens, more than 966 million are aged 10 or above, according to the governments most recent census in 2011. If one in 15 people of this group have been infected with Covid-19, thats a total of 63.78 million people.\nAs of Wednesday, India has reported more than 6.1 million cases and 96,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\nThe survey suggests that for every one infection officially reported, there are actually 26 to 32 people infected who slip through the cracks, said Dr. Balram Bhargava, director of the medical council, at a news conference on Tuesday.\nThis falls in line with what many experts have warned for months  that Indias coronavirus crisis may be much more dire than official figures suggest.\nThere are numerous reasons for this: People simply arent getting tested enough. There are sometimes errors in reporting and registering cases. Changing government strategies can muddle the numbers and paint a misleading picture of the situation.\nThe government began rolling back restrictions in May after a months-long lockdown, with ministers turning their attention to reopening the economy and public services. But experts, including Bhargava, warn that its too soon to relax.\nSince a large proportion of the population is still susceptible, prevention fatigue has to be avoided, Bhargava said, adding that the risk of infection was highest in urban slums where millions live in crowded conditions, often with limited sanitation or running water.\nSlum residents had a seroprevalence  meaning they carried antibodies  of 15.6%, almost double the 8.2% detected in residents of non-slum urban areas. The figure drops in rural areas to 4.4%, according to the survey.\nThe survey shows how important it is for the Indian public to continue taking coronavirus precautions like social distancing and personal hygiene, said Bhargava on Tuesday  especially during Diwali, the festival of lights. The festival, which this year falls on November 14, is one of Indias biggest annual holidays.\nIn light of the upcoming festivities, in light of the winter season and mass gathering, containment strategies must be implemented by the states and the use of masks cannot be underlined more than after this seroprevalence survey, he warned. That is very, very essential.\nThe numbers dont show the full picture\nExperts have long suspected that the number of cases in India may be vastly underreported.\nRamanan Laxminarayan, a senior research scholar at Princeton University, predicted that the country may be undercounting infections by a factor of 50 to 100  meaning the true number could be upwards of 100 million.\nOne simple reason behind the discrepancy is insufficent testing. India has stepped up its testing, almost doubling the amount of tests conducted during the month of August  but it still lags far behind other major countries.\nOnly about 82 of every 100,000 people in India are being tested per day, according to Johns Hopkins University  compared to about 284 in the US and 329 in the United Kingdom.\nAll the other countries test two times, three times, 10 times what India is testing, community medicine specialist Dr. Hemant Shewade told CNN earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, Indias mortality rate of 1.6% looks much lower than other countries  compared to 2.9% in the US, 9.5% in the UK, and 11.5% in Italy, according to Johns Hopkins University. But coronavirus deaths, too, are likely being undercounted.\nEven when India isnt facing a pandemic, its underfunded public health infrastructure means that only 86% of deaths nationwide are even registered in government systems. And only 22% of all registered deaths get an official cause of death, certified by a doctor, Shewade said.\nAnd even if a coronavirus patient tested positive before dying, they might not be counted as a Covid-19 death if they had other preexisting conditions, such as diabetes or cancer, which could be recorded as the cause of death instead, he added.\nSome world leaders have pointed out the flaws in case reporting; US President Donald Trump brought up the topic during the presidential debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday night.\nWhen you talk about numbers, you dont know how many people died in China, you dont know how many people died in Russia, you dont know how many people died in India, he said. They dont exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image depicts a woman walking a dog on a Paris bridge with the Eiffel Tower visible in the background; the overall atmosphere suggests a potential lockdown period. However, the external check reveals a complete lack of supporting evidence. The external search yielded articles unrelated to the caption's claim; there's no mention of a woman walking a dog in Paris during the April 2020 COVID-19 confinement. This significant discrepancy creates a conflict.  While the image itself strongly suggests a scene consistent with the caption, the absence of corroborating external evidence heavily weakens the claim.  The internal confidence score is significantly higher than the external score (10 vs 0), indicating a strong internal alignment but a complete failure of external validation. Given the lack of external verification, it's impossible to confidently confirm the caption's specific claim regarding the date and context of the COVID-19 confinement. Therefore, the overall confidence score is low (3 out of 10), and the caption is deemed out of context due to a lack of external evidence despite strong internal alignment with the image's visual details.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on image content (confidence 10).  External check finds no supporting evidence (confidence 0).  The lack of external validation outweighs strong internal alignment, leading to a low overall confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

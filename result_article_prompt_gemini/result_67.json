    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption to be largely inconsistent with the image, scoring it a 3 out of 10 in confidence.  The image depicts a person using a tool to clear vegetation from a sorghum field; there are no locusts visible. The external check, however, finds the caption plausible (8 out of 10), citing locust swarms as a known threat to sorghum crops in Ethiopia.  The conflict arises because the image content does not support the locust-related part of the caption. While locust swarms are a known issue in Ethiopia, and the presence of a sorghum field aligns with the caption, the lack of locusts in the picture is a significant discrepancy. The external check's plausibility is based on general knowledge of Ethiopian agriculture and locust infestations, not on verification of the specific event described in the caption.  Because the image itself directly contradicts a key element of the caption (the presence of locusts), the overall confidence score is low.  There is insufficient evidence to support the claim of locusts based on the visual data. The image only shows a farmer working in a sorghum field. The external check's information does not offer specific visual verification to contradict the image.  Therefore, despite the plausible external context, the lack of visual evidence in the image for the locust swarm makes the caption out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds caption inconsistent with image due to lack of locusts; external check finds scenario plausible but lacks specific verification.  Image content contradicts a key element of the caption resulting in a low confidence score."

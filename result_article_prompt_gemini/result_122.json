A few days after the gun was listed, the entertainment web site Freddy Mag published a fake news article reporting that musician Kendrick Lamar had purchased the gun, then destroyed it live on stage:\n\"It was just the socially conscious thing to do. Plus all press is good press and I wasn't about to let him get anymore.\" Said rapper Kendrick Lamar about purchasing the gun used to murder Trayvon Martin that George Zimmerman put up for sale.\nThis story is a piece of fiction from a \"satire\" web site. Freddy Mag labels itself as \"number one in satirical urban culture news\" at the bottom of their site. Additionally, the web site's Facebook page states that its content is not real news:\nUrban culture and viral entertainment news. Because real news is depressing as f************ck.",

    "explanation": "The caption claims that Kendrick Lamar bought and publicly destroyed the gun used by George Zimmerman to kill Trayvon Martin.  Both internal and external checks decisively refute this claim. \n\nInternal validation examines the image itself. The image only shows Kendrick Lamar performing on stage; there are no guns, no mention of Zimmerman or Martin, and nothing to suggest the event described in the caption.  The internal check's confidence score is 0, indicating a complete lack of visual evidence to support the caption.  The explanation clearly states there is no visual link between the image and the described event. The verdict is definitively false.\n\nExternal validation uses Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, to verify the caption's claim. Snopes explicitly debunks the story, tracing its origin to a satirical website, Freddy Mag. Snopes provides evidence that Freddy Mag's Facebook page openly states that its content is not real news. This external check has a confidence score of 10,  representing absolute certainty in its finding that the caption is false.  The supporting points section directly quotes Snopes to show how the original claim is fake news and clearly marked as satire.\n\nThere is no conflict between the internal and external checks. Both independently and strongly confirm that the caption is completely out of context with respect to the provided image. The internal analysis finds no evidence in the image to support the claim, while the external validation definitively proves the claim itself to be false. There is no ambiguity; the evidence from both methods converges to a single, unambiguous conclusion.  Given the high confidence scores (0 for internal and 10 for external) and the complete agreement between the two checks, the final confidence score is 10. The final verdict is that the caption is completely out of context and inaccurate.",

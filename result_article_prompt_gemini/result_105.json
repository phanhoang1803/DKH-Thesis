        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\nOrigin\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\" This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City policy  commonly referred to as the global gag rule. The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot  unlike the global gag rule  be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that bodys sexual and reproductive health agency whose mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled.\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the domestic gag rule  a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. Organizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services, the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations. Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

      "explanation": "The claim that President Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad is rated as \"False\" by Snopes.  Their analysis indicates that while Biden rescinded the \"global gag rule\" which restricted funding to organizations involved in abortion, this did not change the existing Helms Amendment, which prohibits direct U.S. funding of abortions abroad.  Therefore, Biden's actions did not allow for the funding of abortions abroad, and the caption's assertion is inaccurate.",
      "supporting_points": "Snopes article states: \"None of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse.\"  Furthermore, they explain that the Helms Amendment, a law from 1973, prohibits such funding and remains in effect.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (score 10) that the image aligns with the caption's description of President Biden signing an executive order.  The image clearly shows Biden in the Oval Office signing a document.  However, the external validation, using Snopes, reveals a significant discrepancy.  Snopes provides strong evidence (confidence score 10) contradicting the caption's claim.  They demonstrate that while President Biden rescinded the \"global gag rule,\" this action did not, contrary to the caption, result in U.S. funding of abortions abroad.  The Helms Amendment, a law prohibiting direct U.S. funding of abortions abroad, remained in effect.  This crucial factual error in the caption renders it out of context.  The high confidence scores from both checks, despite their conflicting conclusions, reinforce the certainty of the final judgment.  The conflict is resolved by prioritizing the externally verified factual accuracy over the internal consistency of the image and caption.  The image depicts a signing ceremony, but the caption misrepresents the substance of the signed order. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because it inaccurately describes the consequence of the executive order signed by President Biden.  The external source (Snopes) provided irrefutable evidence that debunked the core claim of the caption.  The detailed analysis from Snopes, which includes references to the Helms Amendment and the specifics of Biden's actions, is pivotal in determining the factual inaccuracy of the original caption.  There is no ambiguity; the caption is factually incorrect, and therefore misrepresents the context of the image. The high confidence score reflects the robust evidence from both internal and external validation, even though these are in direct conflict.  The resolution prioritizes verifiable fact-checking over image-caption alignment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in image-caption alignment. External check (Snopes) reveals high confidence in factual inaccuracy of the caption's claim regarding U.S. funding of abortions abroad.  The external validation outweighs the internal assessment due to the factual error in the caption.  The caption is out of context."

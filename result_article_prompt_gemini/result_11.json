        "content": "First lady Melania Trump arrived in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday in an unannounced trip to the border area amid the administration's crisis over the separation of families.\nBefore embarking on a tour of Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter, which currently houses about 60 migrant children, most of them teenagers, Mrs. Trump thanked the staff and participated in a question-and-answer session with shelter workers while sitting in front of walls papered with colorful children's art.\n\"I'm here to learn about the facility to which I know you housed children on a long-term basis,\" she told the group. \"And I also like to ask you how I can help these children reunite with their families as quickly as possible.\"\nThe first lady's visit offered a distinctly different set of visuals on a crisis that has so far been illustrated by the sights and sounds of children housed in what look like cages and wailing for their parents. The facility Mrs. Trump chose to visit is a small, permanent shelter that opened in 2014 and typically houses children who cross the border without a parent, a group of migrants known as unaccompanied alien children.\nAccording to a senior administration official, six of the 60 children from Honduras and El Salvador housed at that shelter were separated from their parents.\nThe first lady questioned the nonprofit shelter staff over the family status of the children and how frequently they can talk to their parents  twice a week, a staffer told her, once the child's parents are confirmed to actually be their parents.\nMrs. Trump had also planned to try and visit a customs and border patrol processing center, but had to cancel because of flooding in the area. A statement from the first lady's office said she wanted to \"hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families.\"\nA spokesperson told reporters the trip was planned before President Donald Trump ended the policy; the trip was \"100 percent her idea  she absolutely wanted to come.\"\nHer two-hour visit came as the Trump administration has tried to spin the family separation crisis in their favor. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new \"zero tolerance\" policy in April that directs authorities to prosecute all instances of illegal border crossings, resulting in thousands of children being separated from their parents or legal guardians in a six-week period. The Trump administration at first maintained that the increasing number of children being separated from their mothers at the U.S. southern border was not a policy of its own making but just a tragic byproduct of enforcing the law against illegal border crossings.\nAmid growing backlash and media reports of the facilities in which the children were being held, the president sought repeatedly to blame \"bad legislation passed by Democrats\" for his policy while claiming Congress alone could fix it.\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed first that there was no family separation policy, then in a White House press briefing Monday blamed Congress for it and argued that family separation was simply a continuation of previous administrations' policies. That's false the Obama administration usually detained children and parents together  but it's a defense Trump himself seized on in recent days after being confronted by increasingly angry members of his own party who spoke out against the policy.\nOn Wednesday, Trump issued an executive order halting his administration's family separation practice, but did not address where newly arriving families would stay or how the 2,300 children already separated will be reunited with their parents.\n\"Our first lady is down now at the border, because it really bothered her to be looking at this and seeing this, as it bothered me,\" Trump said on Thursday at a Cabinet meeting, before complaining that the crisis was the fault of Democratic lawmakers who \"don't care about the children.\"\nThe president cited his wife and daughter on Wednesday when signing the executive order on the matter.\n\"Ivanka feels very strongly. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it. We don't like to see families separated. At the same time, we don't want people coming into our country illegally. This takes care of the problem,\" he said. He did not mention that an executive order wasn't needed to end the practice, as the Department of Justice had begun implementing the policy without one.\nMrs. Trump waded into the controversy on Sunday, releasing a rare statement hours before Laura Bush and the other living former first ladies  Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama  weighed in on the issue, too.\n\"Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\" according to a statement from her spokeswoman. \"She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\"\nThe president said Thursday he would direct agencies to reunite families who had been separated under his administration's practice, though the timeline for that is still unclear. The executive order issued Wednesday suggested the government intends to detain whole families together in the future.\nHouse Republicans have been working on two bills meant to address the immigration issues Trump has said need fixing. On Thursday, members voted down a conservative immigration bill, and GOP leaders postponed the vote on a compromise measure originally scheduled for later in the day.\nMembers rejected legislation authored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and favored by conservatives that would have authorized  but not appropriated  government funding for a border wall. It also would not have provided a pathway to citizenship for those eligible under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\nThe vote on the compromise measure had been slated for early Thursday evening, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that vote had been postponed until Friday to give members more time to review the legislation.",

      "explanation": "The caption states that President Trump visited the Southern border in McAllen, Texas on Thursday.  Source 1 mentions that President Trump *said* he would direct agencies to reunite families separated at the border on Thursday, and that he mentioned his wife's visit to the border. The article focuses heavily on Melania Trump's visit, not the President's. While the President's presence at the border is not directly stated or explicitly denied, the focus of the article and lack of explicit mention of a presidential visit lowers confidence.  There's a lack of direct corroboration regarding President Trump's border visit itself within the provided source.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) that the caption is accurate based on the image content alone. The image clearly depicts President Trump in a setting that appears to be on the Southern border. However, the external check has significantly lower confidence (7) due to a lack of corroborating evidence in the referenced source.  The external source mentions President Trump's comments about family reunification and his wife's border visit on Thursday but doesn't explicitly confirm the President's presence at the border himself. This discrepancy necessitates a lower overall confidence score. The external check's focus on Melania Trump's visit overshadows any mention of the President's visit, creating uncertainty.  To resolve the discrepancy, further investigation would be necessary, perhaps by consulting additional news articles or official records from that date to confirm the President's visit to the specified location. Without such additional corroboration, the lack of explicit mention of the President's visit in a relevant news source lowers the overall confidence. Hence, the conclusion leans towards the caption being potentially out of context because of the insufficient external validation, despite the strong internal consistency. The confidence score is lowered to reflect this uncertainty. The internal validation is not enough to overcome the external validation's lack of support for the claim. Therefore, while the image strongly suggests the caption's accuracy, the absence of external confirmation necessitates a cautious assessment of the situation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption (confidence 10), while external check finds insufficient evidence (confidence 7), leading to an overall OOC judgement."

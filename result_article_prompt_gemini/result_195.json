While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

However, Source 1 immediately reveals that this was a digitally manipulated image, not a real event.  The article details how the image was a joke shared on Facebook that was mistakenly reported by several news outlets.

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies an alignment issue: while the image shows a purple lobster, it doesn't verify the person or location stated in the caption. The external check reveals a significant discrepancy. Although the caption's details initially seem consistent with some news reports, these reports are shown to be based on a digitally manipulated image, meaning the caption's claim is false. The high confidence score from the external check (4) and the internal check (8) both point to the caption being out of context.  The internal check's lower confidence score reflects the image's limitations in verifying all aspects of the caption. The external check's evidence convincingly demonstrates that the image and accompanying caption are not representative of a genuine event. The conflict between the two checks is resolved by prioritizing the external verification, which provides concrete evidence refuting the caption's claim of a real event.  The news reports were inaccurate in presenting the digitally manipulated image as a factual account.  In summary, the caption's details are inconsistent with the reality that the image is digitally altered, hence the high confidence of \"OOC\" as true.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows partial alignment (image shows purple lobster but doesn't verify other details), while external check reveals caption is based on a false news report stemming from a digitally manipulated image. Both checks, particularly the external one, strongly suggest the caption is out of context."

That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that the FBI raided the CDC to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism.  Source 1 mentions a claim that such a raid happened, but immediately identifies it as a hoax propagated by a known purveyor of false claims. The source provides details that are presented as unsubstantiated claims and do not represent reliable reporting.  Therefore, the caption's claim is not supported by the article, rather it's explicitly identified as false. ",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1:  Describes the claim as a hoax, stating that a known hoax purveyor spread false claims about the FBI raiding the CDC for data on vaccines and autism on the order of President Trump.

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The claim that the FBI raided the CDC to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  The internal check identifies a significant discrepancy: the image shows the CDC building, but there is no depiction of an FBI raid. The caption's narrative of a nighttime raid and seizure of vaccine-autism data is entirely absent from the visual context. The internal check gives a low confidence score of 8, reflecting the mismatch between the image and the caption's narrative.  The external check provides stronger evidence of the caption's falsity, with a confidence score of 3.  It cites a news source that explicitly labels the claim as a hoax propagated by a known disseminator of false information. The source further details unsubstantiated claims surrounding this alleged raid, reinforcing the lack of credible support for the caption's statement.  The external check's lower confidence score stems from the nature of the evidence, relying on a news source's assessment of a claim's veracity rather than direct, independent verification of the event itself. However, the explicit identification of the claim as a hoax carries significant weight.  The combination of the internal check's identification of a factual discrepancy between image and text and the external check's exposure of the claim as a demonstrable hoax provides compelling evidence to classify the caption as out of context. The high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong consensus between the internal and external validation, despite the difference in confidence scores assigned to each assessment.  The internal check rightly flags the image-caption mismatch, while the external check robustly confirms the overall falsehood of the caption's claim. The fact that both checks point towards the caption being out of context, even with different scores, strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and unrelated to the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image shows the CDC building, but not an FBI raid.  External sources label the core claim of the caption – an FBI raid to obtain vaccine-autism data – as a hoax."

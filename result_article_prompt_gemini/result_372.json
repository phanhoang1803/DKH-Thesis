Where should he put his hands when he pulls his gun? Does he need to wear a necktie if he already has a police badge hanging around his collar? How do you spin a criminal suspect to put him in handcuffs?\nIm going to cuff people at will now, Mr. Samberg said recently, marveling at his new skill set. Ill go to bars and just cuff people.\nLife has been a bit different for Mr. Samberg, a 35-year-old alumnus of Saturday Night Live, since he joined the squad at Brooklyn Nine-Nine, a new Fox comedy set in a fictional New York police precinct.",

      "explanation": "The provided text states that \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" moved from Fox to NBC for its sixth season.  Source 1 only mentions the show's first season airing on Fox.

    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content.  The image clearly depicts the cast of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" and the NBCUniversal logo in the background aligns with the caption's claim about the show airing on NBC. However, the external validation check shows low confidence (4), revealing a discrepancy.  The external source only confirms the show's first season airing on Fox and lacks information on subsequent season network changes. This conflict necessitates a lower overall confidence score. The external check's inability to verify the network switch for the sixth season undermines the caption's claim, even though the image strongly supports it internally.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context due to the lack of conclusive external evidence, despite the internal support. More information about the show's network history is needed to definitively confirm the claim. The high internal confidence score suggests that the image is indeed from a \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" event at NBC, but this alone isn't enough to confirm the network change for season six.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (confidence 10), while external validation provides weak support (confidence 4), revealing a discrepancy.  Lack of conclusive external evidence about the network change for season 6 leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

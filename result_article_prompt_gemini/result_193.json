That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

Source 1 mentions a claim that this happened, but explicitly labels it as a hoax spread by a known purveyor of false information.

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check found that the image shows the CDC building but does not depict any FBI raid, resulting in a low confidence score of 8 and a verdict of False.  The external check further confirmed this by referencing a source that explicitly identifies the claim of an FBI raid on the CDC as a hoax.  The external check also provided a confidence score of 3 and a verdict of False. The low confidence score from the external check is due to the limited number of supporting sources. However, the fact that the identified source directly refutes the claim adds significant weight to the overall assessment.\n\nThe discrepancies between internal and external checks are minimal in this case. Both checks independently came to the same conclusion: the caption's description of an FBI raid is not supported by evidence. There is no conflict; both align in concluding that the caption is out of context.\n\nThe entity alignment in the caption is partially accurate. The caption correctly identifies the CDC building, which is visible in the image.  However, the claim of an FBI raid is entirely absent from the image, representing a misalignment of entities.  This misalignment, along with the external evidence refuting the raid's occurrence, increases confidence in the conclusion that the caption is out of context.\n\nThe high confidence score (9 out of 10) is a result of the combined evidence.  The internal check, which assessed the image's content, and the external check, which investigated the factual accuracy of the caption's claim, both independently support the conclusion. The agreement between the two checks strengthens the overall assessment, justifying the high confidence score. No uncertainty exists because the evidence from both checks is strongly consistent and converges to the same result.\n\nIn summary, the strong agreement between internal and external verification, the absence of an FBI raid in the image, and the explicit debunking of the claim by a reliable source all point to a definitive conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks independently and strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image shows the CDC building but lacks any evidence of an FBI raid, while external sources debunk the claim of such a raid as a hoax."

      "explanation": "The caption's plausibility hinges on verifying if Fatuma Musa Afrah participated in such a demonstration.  While Somali activists advocating for refugee rights are not uncommon, and Seebruecke is a known organization staging such demonstrations, the specific details linking the activist to this event require external verification. The overall scenario described is plausible, but without independent confirmation of Afrah's presence, certainty is limited.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows a confidence score of 8, based on the visual alignment between the image and the caption's core elements: a woman of African descent raising her fist at a demonstration related to refugees. However, it acknowledges that it can't definitively confirm the woman's identity. The external check has a lower confidence score of 7, emphasizing the need to verify if Fatuma Musa Afrah actually participated in the specific demonstration mentioned in the caption.  Although it supports the plausibility of the event's general description—Somali activists advocating for refugee rights, the Seebruecke organization's activities, and the refugee crisis in Greece—it highlights the lack of evidence directly linking the activist to this particular demonstration.  The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty: the internal check focuses on visual similarities, while the external check requires verifiable evidence to confirm the named individual's participation in that specific event. Because the external check, which requires verification of factual details, holds less confidence, and the image alone cannot verify identity or specific event participation, the overall assessment is that the caption might be out of context.  The caption is plausible, but the lack of definitive proof regarding the named activist's involvement renders it uncertain.  A higher confidence level would require external sources definitively confirming Fatuma Musa Afrah's attendance at the specified Berlin demonstration.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds visual consistency; external check requires confirmation of activist's presence at the described event. Discrepancy exists in certainty levels.  Insufficient evidence makes a definitive conclusion uncertain; thus, OOC is marked as true, as external validation is not conclusive."

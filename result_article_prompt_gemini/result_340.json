(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

The article from Snopes.com explicitly states that the photographs were originally correctly identified, but later versions falsely claimed they depicted icebergs in Lake Michigan.

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption, \"The icebergs pictured above as a phenomenon encountered in Lake Michigan,\" is inaccurate. The internal check points out that Lake Michigan is a freshwater lake and does not support the formation of icebergs, which are formed from glaciers in saltwater environments. This internal inconsistency has a confidence score of 0, indicating a complete mismatch.  The external check corroborates this finding with evidence from Snopes.com.  Snopes confirms that while the original photographs were correctly identified, later versions falsely attributed them to Lake Michigan.  Snopes traces the images to a location near Cape Town, South Africa, thousands of miles away from Lake Michigan. This external evidence carries a confidence score of 3, indicating strong support for the caption's inaccuracy. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both decisively demonstrate the caption's falsity. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong agreement between the internal and external validation, which leaves no doubt about the caption's misrepresentation of the image's context. The entity analysis further supports this conclusion by verifying that icebergs are not typically found in Lake Michigan.  In summary, all evidence points to the caption being demonstrably out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is false.  The internal check identifies an inherent geographical impossibility, and the external check provides verifiable evidence from Snopes.com placing the icebergs thousands of miles from Lake Michigan."

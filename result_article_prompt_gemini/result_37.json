        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, explicitly debunked the rumor in a YouTube video, confirming that the doll never left the museum.  The article also notes that the museum was closed in 2018, further supporting the claim that an escape was impossible. There is no corroboration from any reliable source to support the claim of the doll escaping.",

    "explanation": "The caption \"The Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut\" is definitively out of context based on both internal and external evidence.  The internal check reveals a low confidence score (8) because while the image depicts a doll resembling Annabelle, it lacks any contextual information about an escape from a museum. The image alone cannot confirm or deny the claim.  Crucially, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score 10) that directly contradicts the caption.  Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks the claim of Annabelle's escape, citing statements from Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, who confirms the doll remained in the museum.  This is corroborated by the fact that the museum was closed in 2018, making an escape impossible.  Therefore, there's a complete alignment between the internal and external validations, both pointing towards the falsity and out-of-context nature of the caption.  No credible evidence supports the claim of Annabelle's escape. The high confidence score (10) from the external check outweighs the lower score (8) from the internal check, emphasizing the strong evidence against the caption's accuracy.  The discrepancy is resolved by acknowledging the image's lack of context and prioritizing the reliable external sources that definitively refute the claim.  In conclusion, the caption is demonstrably out of context, with overwhelming evidence supporting this conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is false and out of context. The internal check finds the image insufficient to support the claim, while the external check cites multiple reliable sources debunking the rumor of Annabelle's escape."

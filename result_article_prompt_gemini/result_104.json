        "content": "On East 11th Street in New Yorks East Village, tucked between first and second avenue is Casey Rubber Stamp storefront. It is small, just like the store itself. Blink and youll miss it.\nHello! John Casey calls out to a customer from a sea of small stamps. He doesnt need to speak loudly as the store is cozy. If you have any questions, just shout, he adds in a thick Irish brogue.\nCaseys stamp store is the type youd expect to find nestled in a small rural town. Its filled with small treasures in the form of small stamps that have been handmade with care. Yet here it is in the East Village, just a stones throw away from Broadway. It continues to survive in a neighborhood where, in the last three months, median sales prices of homes reached $2.2m, up 122% in just one year, according to Trulia.\nCasey has watched as other New York stamp shops have shuttered their doors. Three rubber stamp places in the city have gone out of business in the last year and a half, he says. A friend of mine closed down in September. Then two others: one closed in the spring and the other closed late last year.\nBut he holds out hope that the charm of his work will still resonate with customers in an age when most graphics are going digital.\nSticking with simple equipment and focusing mostly on design is what has kept him in business, says Casey, who refers to his stamp-making business as old school.\nPeople say: Oh, computers are going to put you out of business. Instinctively, I know that the graphic people will like to get their hands wet, actually hold something tangible than just touch a computer screen. This has a niche that will last quite a while, he says. Its not the business it used to be. But theres enough of a market for this other thing.\nThat doesnt mean his shop hasnt changed with the times. Originally, most of Caseys revenue came from the sale of the collection of his stamps, consisting of more than 15,000 designs. But with each passing year, he has shifted into more custom work. And his custom business has grown, accounting for an increasing amount of his revenue compared to the sale of the stamps on display, awaiting purchase.\nToday, his revenue is split evenly between those and the custom-design stamp work done in the store, he says. A one-square-inch stamp costs about $20.\nWhether that will be enough to keep him in business over the next few years remains to be seen.\nCasey has been in the stamp-making business for about 35 years and has been based out of the East Village for more than 12.\nA lot has changed in the past years few years, especially the rent. Recently, the average asking price for retail space in Manhattan reached $149 per square foot, up from $130 in 2013, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. South of 14th street where Caseys shop is located, the average asking price is slightly lower at $135 per square foot, up from $123 in 2013.\nSince October 2008, the NYC Small Business Congress has been trying to get the city council to pass the Small Business Jobs Survival Act, which focuses on simplifying commercial lease renewal. The act is supposed to help establish guidelines for lease renewal and eliminate all formulas established to trigger arbitration in the commercial lease renewal process. Most recently, in June 2014, the bill was reintroduced by council member Annabel Palma.\nLandlords will kill you, Casey says, chuckling. He has had a few run-ins with his landlady this past years, but thats all sorted out now. Bureaucracies will kill you. Typical hates of any small business.\nThe rising rents are certainly a cause of concern for Casey, but the small-business owner, who learned most of what he knows on his own, hopes to stick around. Despite the headaches of running a small business, Casey cant imagine closing down or selling out,even if someone walked in and offered to buy it at a good price.\nWhy would I? What am I going to do? Its like winning the lottery, he says. What would I do tomorrow morning? Get new friends?\nClose to the register is a box of stamps adorned with logos of local business, including one for B cup cafe around the block. Casey says a lot of his business comes from small business  like Jojos Sriracha  that want logos for labels and letterheads. Sometimes big companies want stamps for test marketing: they are quick, simple and do the job. Other commissions include local artists who want stamps of their art to sell on Etsy.\nCaseys favorite customer? Children, who never pick what their parents expect them to.\nBasically, we produce a very simple low-tech item that does a very high-quality job in a limited but interesting way, he says.\nHe seems to be good-humored about everything, even his past mistakes. When asked if he has regrets, he says: Of course, tons. I am not Frank Sinatra. He had a few, but too few to mention. I have too many, too many to mention.\nBut he does mention one: not having a business mentor.\nAmong the few things he has learned running a business on his own is that it helps to be frugal and that luck matters.\nIve always said that the difference between success and failure is being right 55% of the time. You have to be lucky. Luck goes a long way. Serendipity goes a long way, but luck certainly does, he says. Being in the right place at the right time and making a couple of right decisions can give one an edge, he adds, whereas few small decisions can break you.\nFor now, Casey seems to be staying lucky, and remaining one of the hidden treasures of New Yorks East Village.",

      "explanation": "Source 1 explicitly mentions a rubber stamp shop owned by John Casey located on East 11th Street in New York's East Village.  While the caption doesn't specify the profession as 'rubber stamp shop owner', it's strongly implied and consistent with the article's description of Casey's business. The location (East Village, Manhattan) is precisely corroborated. The article's detailed description of Casey's work and the shop's location strongly supports the claim in the news caption.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, noting that the image clearly depicts a postal worker in what seems to be a Manhattan street scene, consistent with the East Village. The external check, while giving a slightly lower confidence score of 8, still corroborates the location (East Village, Manhattan) and implicitly supports the profession of the individual in the image.  The external check references a news source mentioning a business in the East Village but doesn't directly name the pictured individual as the business owner. However, the context strongly suggests the possibility that the individual is in fact a worker in the East Village, aligning with the caption's description. There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks.  The slight difference in confidence scores can be attributed to the external check's reliance on an indirect connection to the profession (implying a worker in the East Village through a related business) rather than a direct statement. The image itself strongly supports the caption's claim of a postal worker in Manhattan's East Village. The high agreement between the two checks, along with the visual evidence from the image, strongly suggests that the caption is accurate and not out of context. The high confidence score of 9 reflects this strong agreement and the visual corroboration.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows a postal worker, and the location is consistent with the East Village in Manhattan. External validation indirectly supports the profession by referring to a related business in the same area.  No conflicts were found."

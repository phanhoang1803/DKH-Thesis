        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

      "explanation": "The caption's claim that \"Some 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018\" is partially supported by the provided article from Snopes.  The article confirms that a list of approximately 53,000 deceased individuals was identified and flagged for removal from Florida's voter rolls. However, it's crucial to note that the article emphasizes this was a list of *potential* deceased voters, not confirmed dead voters who had actually cast ballots. The article highlights that the methodology used to compile the list was questioned and that it did not indicate any of those individuals had voted.  The claim in the caption could be interpreted as suggesting these individuals illegally voted;  the article does not support this stronger claim. Therefore, the verdict is partially true, with a lower confidence score due to the crucial nuance about the list's nature.",

    "explanation": "The image shows individuals handling what seems to be ballots or similar paper documents. Although the image does not specify the location as Florida, nor does it give information on the number of deceased voters, the context of ballot handling aligns loosely with the subject of voter rolls. The internal check gives a confidence score of 10 because the image's context is generally related to the caption's topic, despite lacking direct visual verification of the specific claim.  However, the external check reveals a crucial detail. While it confirms the existence of a list of roughly 53,000 potentially deceased individuals flagged for removal from Florida's voter rolls in November 2018, it highlights that this was a list of *potential* deceased voters, not confirmed deceased individuals who had actually voted. The external check's lower confidence score of 7 reflects this key difference and the fact that the caption might be interpreted as suggesting these individuals illegally voted, which is not supported by the article.  The conflict lies in the caption's stronger implication that 53,000 dead people *voted*, while external evidence demonstrates that the list merely identified potential deceased voters whose eligibility needed verification, with no proof of actual voting.  The external evidence significantly weakens the caption's claim. The internal check's high confidence score is based on loose contextual relevance rather than a direct visual match for the caption's assertion.  Considering both checks, the caption is out of context because it presents a stronger, unsupported claim, and the image provides only a vague contextual connection. Therefore, the final confidence score is reduced to 7, reflecting the external validation's nuance and the absence of direct visual proof from the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows loose contextual relevance; External check reveals the caption's claim is partially true but overstates the situation, implying illegal voting that is not supported by evidence.  The final assessment is that the caption is out of context due to a mismatch between the caption's stronger claim and the evidence."

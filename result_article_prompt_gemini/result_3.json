        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

      "explanation": "The claim in the news caption is partially supported by the article from Snopes.  The article mentions that Florida election officials sent a list of approximately 53,000 people believed to be dead to county election supervisors for removal from the voter rolls in November 2018. However, the article also highlights that this was part of an ongoing effort to clean up the voter rolls and that the claim that these people had voted was false. The original claim was spread by social media, and it is important to consider the source of that information and whether it is reliable. The article does not definitively state that 53,000 dead people were found on the voter rolls in November 2018 but focuses on the controversy surrounding the claim.",

    "explanation": "The original caption states that 53,000 dead people were found on the state's voter rolls in November 2018. The image shows individuals handling what seems to be ballots or punch cards, but provides no information about the number of deceased individuals on voter rolls or the year.  The internal check thus concludes that there is no visual evidence to support the caption's assertion.  The external check uses information from Snopes, which reports that Florida election officials sent a list of approximately 53,000 deceased individuals to county election supervisors for removal from voter rolls in November 2018. However, this action was part of an ongoing effort to cleanse the voter rolls; the article refutes the claim that these individuals had actually voted.  The Snopes article does not verify that 53,000 dead people were on the voter rolls in November 2018.  The original claim's origin being social media adds to concerns about its reliability. Both checks indicate a discrepancy. The internal check has zero confidence in the claim due to a lack of visual evidence in the image. The external check, while providing some context, shows a low confidence score (7) because the source does not confirm the main claim but emphasizes the controversy surrounding it.  Given the conflicting evidence and the questionable source of the original claim, the caption is determined to be out of context. There is a significant mismatch between the image content and the caption's statement.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds no evidence in the image to support the caption. External check finds partial support in a Snopes article but notes the claim's controversial nature and its origin in unreliable social media.  Both checks indicate a significant discrepancy, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

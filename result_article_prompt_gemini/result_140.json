        "content": "Three victims of a tiger attack at a city zoo taunted the animal moments before it struck, killing one of the men, court documents have revealed.\nPaul Dhaliwal, 19, admitted that he, his brother Kulbir, 23, and their friend Carlos Sousa, 17, who died in the tragedy, had shouted and waved at the tiger, called Tatiana, from the edge of its enclosure at San Francisco zoo.\nAccording to an affidavit obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle, the trio had stood on top of a 3ft railing, but had not thrown anything into the pen to provoke the cat.\nThe men had also been smoking marijuana prior to the incident and toxicology tests showed Dhaliwal had been twice the legal alcohol limit for driving.\n\"As a result of this investigation, (police believe) that the tiger may have been taunted/agitated by its eventual victims,\" said Inspector Valerie Matthews, who prepared the affidavit.\nPolice believe this factor contributed to the tiger escaping from its enclosure and attacking its victims, Matthews said.\nDocuments showed that Sousa's father, Carlos Sousa Sr, said Dhaliwal had told him the three had stood on a metal railing just a few feet from the edge of the tiger moat. \"When they got down they heard a noise in the bushes, and the tiger was jumping out of the bushes on him (Paul Dhaliwal),\" the affidavit revealed.\nPolice later found a partial shoe print that matched Dhaliwal's on top of the railing, Matthews said in the documents.\nThe Siberian tiger attacked the three men on Christmas Day last year after leaping over a 1m (3ft) wall and out of its enclosure. Both brothers suffered serious bite and claw wounds in the attack. Zoo officials have since acknowledged that the wall was 1.2m (4ft) shorter than the recommended minimum.\nThe affidavit also revealed that Kulbir and Sousa both had alcohol in their blood, but within the legal driving limit. All three had marijuana in their systems.\nKulbir Dhaliwal told police that the three had smoked pot and each had \"a couple shots of vodka\" before leaving San Jose for the zoo on Christmas Day, the affidavit said. Police found a small amount of marijuana in Kulbir's car, which the victims had driven to the zoo, as well as a partially drunk bottle of vodka, according to court documents.\nZoo spokesman Sam Singer said he had not seen the documents but believed the victims did taunt the animal, even though they claim they had not. \"Those brothers painted a completely different picture to the public and the press,\" Singer said. \"Now it's starting to come out that what they said is not true.\"\nMark Geragos, a lawyer for the Dhaliwal brothers, was not available for comment yesterday. He has repeatedly said the men did not taunt the tiger. Calls to Sousa's father and Michael Cardoza, a lawyer for the Sousa family, were not returned.",

    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence (score 10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The image clearly displays a Denver Zoo sign and several visitors. However, the external validation check yields a confidence score of 0, indicating no supporting evidence from external sources to corroborate the year mentioned in the caption (2013). This significant discrepancy necessitates a careful analysis.  While the internal check strongly supports the caption's assertion that the image depicts guests at the Denver Zoo, the complete lack of external evidence regarding the year 2013 casts doubt on the caption's accuracy. The absence of external verification weakens the overall confidence.  Therefore, considering both checks, I conclude that the caption is likely out of context due to the unsupported claim about the year. There is no concrete information from external sources to confirm or refute whether the image was indeed taken in 2013. The internal analysis focuses solely on the image's content, offering no information about the year. Without supplementary data, associating the image with 2013 remains speculative.  To increase confidence, additional contextual information such as metadata from the original image file or other supporting documents is necessary to verify the year. The external check's inability to provide any information regarding the Denver Zoo in 2013 significantly weakens the overall assessment. This is a critical limitation since the year specified is a key component of the caption. Overall, due to the lack of external validation, the confidence in the caption's accuracy is low. The claim regarding the year 2013 cannot be verified based on available evidence. While the image is clearly from the Denver Zoo, the temporal element of the caption is unsupported.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (confidence score: 10), while external validation finds no corroborating evidence (confidence score: 0).  The discrepancy stems from the year (2013) mentioned in the caption which is not verified externally. The absence of external validation leads to a low confidence score and a conclusion of the caption being out of context."

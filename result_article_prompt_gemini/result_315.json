      "explanation": "While there are reports of President Trump making controversial statements and gestures, the specific claim of mocking George Floyd and Eric Garner's deaths by pretending to choke and saying \"I can't breathe\" requires further verification.  The claim's plausibility hinges on the existence of a widely available video showing the described actions.  Without access to and verification of the video itself, a definitive judgment can't be made.  Existing knowledge about President Trump's past controversial statements increases the plausibility of such a claim, but doesn't confirm it.",

    "explanation": "The provided image shows Donald Trump speaking at a rally.  There is no evidence within the image itself to support the claim that he is mocking the death of George Floyd or Eric Garner. The internal check correctly identifies this discrepancy and assigns a confidence score of 0. The external check acknowledges reports of controversial statements by President Trump but emphasizes that the specific claim regarding mocking Floyd and Garner's deaths requires further verification, specifically through the video mentioned in the caption. The external check's higher confidence score of 8 reflects the acknowledgment of Trump's history of controversial statements, increasing the plausibility of the claim, but ultimately it cannot confirm the claim without verifying the video. There is a clear discrepancy between the internal and external checks regarding the confidence level.  The internal check, based solely on the image, correctly finds no supporting evidence, while the external check acknowledges the possibility but can't confirm it without the video evidence.  Therefore, we consider the external check's assessment of needing video verification to be essential.  Without the video, the claim remains unverified. This leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context and has a low overall confidence score despite some external plausibility.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds no image evidence supporting the caption. External check acknowledges possibility but stresses the need for video verification to confirm the claim.  The caption is considered out of context due to lack of supporting evidence."

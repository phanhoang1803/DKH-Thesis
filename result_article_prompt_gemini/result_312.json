        "content": "The body of a 61-year-old woman has been found at the scene of a collapsed house in Bury, Greater Manchester.\nEmergency services were called just before 9.30pm on Wednesday, after reports that a house had collapsed in Summerseat, near Ramsbottom.\nThree people were treated at the scene by paramedics for minor injuries, while a woman and child were also taken to hospital with minor injuries.\nThe cause of the collapse has not yet been established. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police (GMP) said: Officers responding to reports of a collapsed house in Ramsbottom have sadly found the body of a woman.\nFive properties were evacuated as a precaution and a small scene remains in place. Inquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident.\nAlthough formal identification of the body found has not taken place yet, police say they believe they know who the woman is, and her family are being supported. An earlier police report mistakingly said the woman was 79.\nOne local resident told the Manchester Evening News they believed the collapse was the result of an explosion, and assisted emergency services in evacuating residents.\nThey said: It was a loud bang. I got as far as the water pump and emergency services were already on scene. I thought there was going to be another explosion and thats why we needed to evacuate.\nI was allowed through and started to clear every building up to the football pitch to get them down to the garden centre. We then got residents back to their own property once it was safe.\nGreater Manchester fire and rescue service said it had dispatched three fire engines and a number of support units to the scene.\nA joint investigation is under way between Greater Manchester police, Greater Manchester fire rescue service and Bury local authority partners to establish the circumstances of the incident.\nSteve Wilcock, the incident commander at the scene on behalf of Greater Manchester fire and rescue service (GMFRS), said: I want to first pass on my condolences to the family and friends of the woman who tragically lost her life at this incident  our thoughts are with them at what must be an incredibly sad and difficult time.\nGiven the nature of this scene, I must also praise the professionalism and dedication of the firefighters who have worked here all night in the driving rain, as well as throughout the morning. An investigation is now under way so it would not be appropriate to speculate at this time on a probable cause.\nIts also important to place on record our appreciation for the help and cooperation of local people. Summerseat is a close-knit community and there has been an outpouring of support, with many neighbours offering their homes to those evacuated from roughly 20 houses last night. I am proud to serve this community and GMFRS, GMP, Bury council and other partner agencies will continue to work really hard today to do the best by local people without compromising the scene.\nA spokesperson for GMFRS said it was too early to determine the cause of the explosion.",

The article explicitly states that the body of a 61-year-old woman was found after a house collapse in Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday evening.  The article gives specific details matching the caption, including the age of the victim, location, and day of the incident.  While the article initially reported the woman's age as 79, this was later corrected to 61. The discrepancy is explained in the article.",

    "explanation": "The internal check finds the image consistent with a house collapse, but notes the absence of information regarding a body. The external check strongly supports the caption by citing a news article reporting the discovery of a 61-year-old woman's body at the scene of a house collapse in Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday evening.  While there's a minor discrepancy initially reported age of the victim (79 in the first report and 61 after correction), this is explained and resolved within the news article. There is no inherent conflict.  The high confidence scores from both internal and external checks (both 10) strongly support the caption's accuracy. The external validation, specifically referencing the news report, provides concrete evidence that aligns with and expands on the caption's information. While the image itself doesn't show a body, the external evidence strongly corroborates the caption's statement that a body was found after the collapse. The image provides visual confirmation of the house collapse, thus supplementing the narrative from the external source.  There is sufficient evidence, with high confidence, to conclude that the caption is not out of context. The minor initial reporting error regarding the victim's age does not negate the overall validity and accuracy of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The external check provides corroborating evidence from a news report, resolving the only minor discrepancy related to the initial reporting of the victim's age. High confidence (10/10) in both checks."

    "explanation": "Internal validation shows high confidence that the caption aligns well with the image content. The image clearly depicts goats walking on a street, which matches the caption's description. However, the external validation reveals a lack of supporting evidence from related articles. None of the provided sources confirm the event of goats strolling in Llandudno on March 31st, as stated in the caption.  This discrepancy between internal and external validation leads to a low overall confidence score. The internal check's high confidence score relies solely on the visual match between the image and caption, while the external check's low confidence stems from the absence of corroborating evidence from external sources. Because the external validation is crucial for verifying the factual accuracy of the claim made in the caption, it outweighs the high internal consistency score. The absence of external evidence strongly suggests a possibility that the claim might be inaccurate or that insufficient research was performed to confirm the event before the caption was created. In the absence of verifiable evidence from external sources, the claim remains unsubstantiated despite the visual coherence within the image itself.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows strong alignment between caption and image.  External validation finds no supporting evidence for the event described in the caption.  The lack of external corroboration significantly lowers the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy."

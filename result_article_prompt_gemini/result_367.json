        "content": "The idea for the project came from Nelson Nol, an entrepreneur who heads Sorocaba's prosthetic branch. He said that the calendar will be sold nationally, and the collected monies will cover not only cover the costs of the campaign, but will create a fund to help families who can not afford prosthetics. \"[The purpose] is to promote beauty, to show that you have life after amputation, and that these patients can lead full lives that include attending clubs, hanging out with friends, and dating,\" stresses Nol.\nThe goal is to show that amputation is only a detail, and that beauty is a matter of attitude. The pictures are all in black and white, but the prostheses will be featured in vivid color images. The initiative is a way to show that physical limitations can not take away a woman's most valuable asset: pride.\nBanker Jaqueline Felizberto opened up in the photographs. She lost her right leg at seven years old when she was hit by a truck in front of her house. But the trauma has not hindered her life. \"I have a normal life: super, super busy, well run. I really enjoy my makeup, go out and have fun. I love the beach. I like to enjoy a lot,\" says the banker turned model for a day.\nCamile Rodrigues was born with a malformed leg, but that did not stop her from becoming a top athlete. At the Pan-American Games in 2011, the swimmer took three silver medals and one bronze. For her, the concept of beauty has little to do with aesthetics. \"Beauty to me is happiness. I think if you're happy, you're beautiful.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that a photograph shows a group of wounded female veterans who have each lost one or both legs.  The related article from Snopes.com explicitly states that a photograph purportedly showing wounded female U.S. veterans is actually a picture of Brazilian amputees. This directly contradicts the caption's claim about the identity of the women in the photograph. The article further describes the women as models participating in a project to promote beauty and show that women can live full lives after amputation. While the article does discuss amputations, it does not support the claim that the photograph shows wounded female veterans.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 10, points out that while the image depicts women with prosthetic legs, there is no evidence within the image itself to confirm their veteran status. The external check, also with a high confidence score of 1, corroborates this by citing a Snopes article that definitively identifies the women in the photograph as Brazilian amputees, not wounded U.S. veterans as the caption claims.  The Snopes article further clarifies that these women are models participating in a project to promote body positivity and the idea that amputees can lead fulfilling lives. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both consistently point towards the inaccuracy of the original caption.  The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the factual information from the Snopes article, leave no room for doubt. The caption misrepresents the identity and context of the individuals depicted in the photograph.  Therefore, a conclusion of 'out of context' is fully justified.  The entity analysis supports this conclusion by verifying the presence of women with prosthetic legs in the image, which aligns with the Snopes article's description but contradicts the original caption's claim of wounded female veterans.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly reject the original caption. Internal analysis finds no evidence of veteran status within the image.  External validation, citing Snopes, confirms the women are Brazilian amputee models, not U.S. veterans.  There's complete agreement, resulting in high confidence that the caption is inaccurate."

However, the retrieved related article is in a different language (likely Kinyarwanda) and does not contain any information about Kenya, zebras, motorcyclists, or the Kimana Sanctuary. Therefore, there is no corroboration between the caption and the retrieved article.",

    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a significant discrepancy: the absence of a motorcyclist in the image, which is explicitly mentioned in the original caption.  The low confidence score (8) reflects this significant mismatch between the caption and the image content.  The external check further weakens the caption's validity by failing to find any corroborating evidence in related articles. The external check's confidence score is 0, indicating a complete lack of supporting evidence. This absence of external validation reinforces the internal concerns about the caption's accuracy.  Given the considerable discrepancies between the caption and both the image content and external sources, the conclusion is that the caption is out of context. The low confidence score reflects the substantial evidence against the caption's accuracy.  There is no evidence to support the claim of a motorcyclist or a specific event in Kimana Sanctuary, Kenya, as described in the caption.  The image shows zebras at night, but this is only a small part of the information present in the caption. The significant missing elements and the lack of supporting evidence reduce confidence substantially. In essence, there's a major discrepancy between what the caption describes and what the image and external verification show. Considering the weight of the evidence and the lack of supporting details, the claim made in the caption is deemed unlikely.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal significant discrepancies between the caption and the provided evidence. The caption mentions a motorcyclist, which is absent in the image.  External verification yields no supporting evidence. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context."

        "content": "A photographer who has taken an image of a city and published it every day for a decade said each one revealed the \"secret beauty\" of the place.\nA Cambridge Diary, which features thousands of photographs, is all about \"catching the moment\" said Martin Bond, its creator.\nBond wanted his online photo diary to highlight the \"normal side\" of the city that is well-known for its grandeur and university. Cambridge is where he was born and still lives and works.\nCapturing an image during the first coronavirus lockdown in March, he said: \"For the first time in my life I saw the true beauty. There was no distraction. The streets were empty - I was forced to look up and around.\"\nBond took the first of his images by accident when, while trying out camera lenses in a shop in March 2010, he caught the moment a decorator dropped paint on to his sandwiches.\n\"From there I realised, because I was brought up in Cambridge, the colleges weren't of much interest to me. I was immune to the beauty of them as I was so used to them, I was more interested in what was going on in the city,\" he said.\n\"Nobody was taking notice or recording the lives of the everyday person, of which I was one, so I took up the mantle.\"\nShooting on a Leica SL camera, Bond shares his images on Facebook, where he has more than 31,000 followers, his own website, Instagram and Twitter.\nThe portrait, rather than landscape, shape of his images has always been his go-to for the diary.\n\"Because the project started with an intention to photograph people, I thought portrait shape would be better because humans are portrait-shaped, not landscape,\" he said.\n\"I was always shooting with the camera level [landscape] and wanted to train myself to turn it 90 degrees more often.\"\nBeing out in all weathers, he said the diary project had also been good for his sense of well-being.\n\"When you hold a camera to your eye you focus on a square of life, you are framing lives,\" he said.\n\"The difference for me between a good day or a bad is whether I've got a good picture or not.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that an image depicts a woman who seems to have conjured birds.  None of the provided text from the related articles mentions a woman, birds, or anything related to magic or conjuring.

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (8) that the caption is contextually relevant because the image depicts a woman attracting many pigeons, which aligns with the figurative meaning of \"conjuring birds.\" However, the external check exhibits low confidence (1) and finds no supporting evidence in related articles.  The articles focus on a different subject, and there's no mention of a woman attracting birds. This significant discrepancy necessitates a low overall confidence score. The external check's lack of supporting evidence strongly suggests the caption is out of context. While the image itself might support the caption's figurative interpretation, the absence of corroborating evidence from external sources makes it unreliable.  Therefore, the caption is judged to be out of context. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty arising from the conflicting results. There is a crucial mismatch between the internal interpretation of the image and the external context provided by the related articles. This indicates a potential issue with either the caption's generation, the articles' relevance, or a misinterpretation of the visual context.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the source of this inconsistency. Without additional information linking the image to the articles' subject matter, it's impossible to definitively reconcile the conflicting assessments. The primary reason for the low confidence is the absence of external validation supporting the claim in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check supports the caption's figurative interpretation, while the external check finds no supporting evidence. This discrepancy leads to a low confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

The article details that the criminal aspect of the FBI investigation \"concerned the president's sacking of Comey, and whether it was an obstruction of justice.\" This aligns with the news caption's assertion that the FBI investigated whether the firing was a national security threat. The article also clarifies that the investigation examined whether Mr. Trump was a national security threat, tying the Comey firing into broader concerns.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) based on the direct visual representation of James Comey, the former FBI director, amidst a press scrum. The caption's assertion that the FBI investigated the firing of Comey is consistent with the image context. The external check provides further corroboration (confidence score of 8) by referencing source material indicating that the FBI's investigation did indeed look into whether the firing constituted an obstruction of justice, a matter directly linked to national security.  While the external source mentions that the investigation also considered whether President Trump himself was a national security threat, this doesn't contradict the caption; it adds context. The caption focuses specifically on the FBI's investigation of the Comey firing's national security implications, a point well-supported by both internal visual analysis and external factual evidence. There are no significant discrepancies between the two validation methods; they both strongly support the caption's accuracy. The minor difference lies in the nuanced detail that the external source adds concerning broader aspects of the FBI's investigation, but this doesn't invalidate the core statement made in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The checks align perfectly on the core assertion, with the external check adding contextual details that don't contradict the caption's focus."

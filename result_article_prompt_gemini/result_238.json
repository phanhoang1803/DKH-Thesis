        "content": "Indonesian police have used tear gas and water cannon to subdue protesters as thousands of hard-line Muslims marched against Jakarta's governor.\nBasuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian, is the first ethnic Chinese to hold the governor's post in the capital of majority Muslim Indonesia.\nThe demonstrators accuse him of having insulted Islam's holy book, the Koran, and want him to be prosecuted.\nClashes broke out between police and protesters who refused to disperse.\nOne elderly man died, the Associated Press reports, citing police. Several other people, including police officers, have been injured.\nProtesters had earlier marched upon the presidential palace.\nPolice had been braced for the possibility of religious and racial tensions erupting at the rally, which an estimated 50,000 people attended.\nIt had mostly been peaceful but groups of angry demonstrators clashed with police after nightfall and set vehicles alight.\nIn 1998, a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment led to mobs looting and burning Chinese-owned shops and houses. Ethnic Chinese make up about 1% of Indonesia's population of 250 million people.\nThe protest was held to demand that Mr Purnama be prosecuted for blasphemy over comments he made in September that were seen as criticising a Koranic verse.\nHe said that Islamic groups using a passage of the Koran to urge people not to support him were deceiving voters, who will go to the polls in February.\nThe verse is interpreted by some as prohibiting Muslims from living under the leadership of a non-Muslim.\nMr Purnama has since apologised but formal complaints were lodged against him by Islamic groups for defamation. He is now being investigated by police.\nWho is Governor Ahok?\nSome protesters at Friday's rally carried signs calling for the governor's death, the BBC's Rebecca Henschke in Jakarta says.\nRepresentatives met with Vice-President Yusuf Kalla, who promised that the investigation into Mr Purnama would be completed within two weeks.",

Source 1 describes violent clashes, injuries, and even a death, but it does not specifically mention protestors covering an elderly woman. While the overall context aligns (protests, clashes, injuries), the specific detail about protestors protecting an elderly person is absent from the source. Therefore, there's partial support, but not a direct confirmation.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows protestors in what appears to be Jakarta, protecting an elderly woman.  The context strongly suggests a protest situation, aligning with the caption's description. However, the external validation provides a much lower confidence score (4).  While external sources confirm protests and clashes with police in Jakarta, they lack direct evidence supporting the specific detail of protestors shielding an elderly woman.  This discrepancy necessitates a lower overall confidence score.  The internal analysis focuses on the direct visual evidence within the image itself, while the external analysis relies on broader news reports that may not capture every detail of the event.  The conflict arises from the specificity of the caption detail versus the generality of available external reporting.  There is a possibility that the image depicts a specific moment not covered in broader news reports, making the caption detail partially true but lacking widespread confirmation.  The lack of corroborating external evidence for the specific action described in the caption (elderly woman being protected by protestors) is crucial.  The image alone does not provide enough contextual information to entirely rule out other possible interpretations or locations.  Therefore, while the image strongly suggests a protest in Jakarta, the absence of external corroboration of the specific action lowers the confidence significantly, leading to the 'OOC: true' conclusion.  It is also important to note that the external sources mainly focus on the larger scale clashes and violence associated with the protest and may not detail every individual interaction during the event.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption based on the image content.  External validation finds partial alignment regarding the protest context but lacks direct confirmation of the specific detail of protestors protecting an elderly woman.  This discrepancy lowers the overall confidence, concluding the caption is likely out of context."

        "content": "This measurement, which predicts an areas coldest temperatures, is only useful for plants that have to survive the winter.\nTheyre called perennials: You plant them once and they come back after each winter if theyre given the right environment to survive. Think things like trees, shrubs and woody plants.\nWindmill palm\nzones 7-11\nHydrangea\nzones 3-9\nAzalea\nzones 6-9\nLavender\nzones 5-9\nWindmill palm\nzones 7-11\nHydrangea\nzones 3-9\nAzalea\nzones 6-9\nLavender\nzones 5-9\nWindmill palm\nzones 7-11\nHydrangea\nzones 3-9\nAzalea\nzones 6-9\nLavender\nzones 5-9\nAnd for predicting winter plant survival, knowing an areas hardiness zone is a big help to gardeners, says Todd Rounsaville, a horticulturist with the USDA who was involved with creating the new map. He explains that the hardiness zone is really one of the best predictors of winter survival and plant survival in general in the landscape.\nHe advises gardeners to use the map as one very important tool of many in their risk assessment toolbox.\nBecause the USDA map has really become the industry standard for rating things, its pretty rare that you will not see a zone rating on a plant, either on the tag or on a website, he says.\nKnowing what your average coldest temperature is helps rightsize your expectations about what might grow in your area. Live in Chicagos Zone 6a? You can be assured that no citrus plants will survive your winter. Instead, try an apple tree. The apple tree is that kid you grew up with who wore shorts all winter. It needs the cold temperatures to set fruit.\nLive in Miamis Zone 11a? No apples for you. Instead, grow dragon fruit!\nWhat does your hardiness zone not tell you?\nOn its own, your hardiness zone cant tell you exactly what to grow in your area.\nFor example, parts of these three areas  Juneau, Alaska; Boston, Mass.; and Santa Fe, N.M.  are all in USDAs Zone 7a.\nJuneau, Alaska\nBoston, Mass.\nSanta Fe, N.M.\nJuneau, Alaska\nBoston, Mass.\nSanta Fe, N.M.\nJuneau,\nAlaska\nBoston,\nMass.\nSanta Fe,\nN.M.\nWe know intuitively that the same plants cant grow in these places, Rounsaville says.\nWhile Juneau may have relatively temperate winters, it also is extremely wet, averaging over 80 inches of snow a year. Santa Fe, on the other hand, is extremely dry, with much hotter summer temperatures than Juneau. Boston has both temperate winters and summers. It gets a good amount of rain but not nearly enough to sustain Juneaus rainforest plants. It gets plenty of heat but is colder and wetter in the winter, making it inhospitable for desert dwellers, like cactuses and other succulents.\nBut all three cities rarely get below zero degrees each winter, so they are classified as the same zone.\nSo when you hear that your zone has changed, here are some things to keep in mind:\n1 The hardiness map says nothing about your extreme lowest temperature\nJust because your average lowest winter temperature has changed, doesnt mean the temperature will never dip below your hardiness zone.\n2 The hardiness map says nothing about the frequency of extreme cold weather\nYour poor plants have to stay outside all winter, so the duration and frequency of cold weather matters for plant survival.\nIf youre naked and you run through a freezer, its not going to kill you, says Andrew Bunting, vice president of horticulture at the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. If you run into the freezer and have to stay there for an extended period of time, its probably going to kill you.\nIf extreme, out-of-zone weather occurs during a quick cold snap, steps can be taken to protect your plants with temporary blankets or other shelters. Pots can be brought inside.\nBut if the extreme lows persist, tender plants will struggle to survive. Your hardiness zone does not take any of this into account.\n3 The hardiness map cant tell you if your plants will survive the summer\nSummer temperature extremes matter a great deal but are not reflected in the USDA hardiness map.\nLets look again at Juneau and Santa Fe, much of which are in Zone 7a. Juneaus all-time high temperature was 90 F in 1975. Summer days in Santa Fe routinely reach the 90s. Some shade- and cool-weather-loving plants like ferns and hostas will thrive in Juneau but struggle mightily in a place like Santa Fe. Likewise, a cactus accustomed to high temperatures would struggle to thrive in the cooler summer temperatures of Juneau, to say nothing of the overwhelming rainfall.\nBecause of this tricky problem, there have been attempts to create a corresponding map that helps gardeners know which plants might survive summer in their area.\nIn 1997, the American Horticultural Society released a heat zone map that measured the average number of times per year that the temperature of an area exceeds 86 F.\nAmerican Horticultural Society\nBut this map didnt become well known among gardeners. On a recent visit to a plant nursery outside Washington, D.C., nearly every plant tag had a USDA hardiness zone, but only one, out of the several dozen checked, had the AHS heat zone listed.\nAbove 86 F, plants from cooler climates rapidly become stressed.\nBecause of these complexities, more plant survival factors should be included in the 2023 map, says Tony Avent, who runs Juniper Level Botanic Garden and Plant Delights Nursery in Raleigh, N.C.\nIf [these metrics] had been factored in, that would have given you a much more applicable map, says Avent, who was a member of the committee that put together the 2012 version of the map.\nAnd thats the part thats a little disappointing.\nBut including more plant survival factors in the USDA hardiness map runs the risk of creating an overly complicated map and muddying its intended use, Rounsaville says.\nIn a perfect world, we could infinitely break down where plants will grow well, but thats very hard to do and produce a map that is, you know, coherent but at a local resolution, Rounsaville says.\nSince the USDA plant hardiness zone cant tell you everything about how a plant will fare in your garden, its a good idea to turn to local plant experts for guidance. Local nurseries and botanical gardens can be great resources for in-depth knowledge of the area and recent warming or cooling trends.\nNew plant varieties are constantly being bred with improvements such as increased hardiness, bloom count, bloom length or color combinations.\nSome nursery owners like Avent enjoy experimenting with these plants. He and his team grow many varieties of plants  both typical and unconventional  to figure out which plants they can bring to market in Raleigh.\nWe live to kill plants, Avent says. He estimates that theyve killed over 50,000 plant varieties in his career. Every one they kill, they record in a database.\nIf my zone changed, can I plant new things now?\nMaybe, and maybe you already did! Its possible you or your neighbors may have already noticed some of these climatic changes and have been experimenting with plant varieties that were once unusual for your area.\nKeep in mind that the new USDA map is backward looking; it represents changes that have already taken place over the past 30 years.\nIn the 7a-7b Philadelphia suburbs, Bunting notes two perennials that he has noticed surviving Philadelphia winters in recent years.\nIt used to be [that] if you had a camellia, it was in a little courtyard with lots of protection, maybe even wrapped [in protective cloth] for the winter. But now, Its perfectly hardy. Same with figs. People used to wrap figs. You dont have to do that anymore.\nOf course, your mileage may vary. As Bunting notes, where you plant a perennial in your yard  whether sheltered or in the open  matters. Some areas get southern exposure and lots of sun, others are behind a house, or under a tree. Every yard has many distinct microclimates, and learning how to harness these subtle differences in your yard can help you plant more ambitious varieties with more confidence.\nGardeners know that if theyre near paved surfaces or brick and mortar structures, that theres a lot of radiant heat that those absorb during the day, Rounsaville says. And they can really push hardiness zones through the winter to help with plant survival.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows some alignment between the image and the caption. The image depicts individuals tending plants in what looks like a garden center setting. This aligns with the caption's description of plant management activities. However, the lack of visual confirmation of the name \"Jo Dickinson\" and the location details weakens the internal consistency.  The external check completely fails to corroborate any part of the caption. No reliable sources mention \"Jo Dickinson\", \"Forest Lodge Garden Centre\", or \"Farnham, Surrey\" in connection with this image. This significant discrepancy casts strong doubt on the caption's accuracy.  Given the low confidence from the external check and the lack of strong visual evidence supporting the specific details in the caption, the final assessment leans heavily towards the caption being out of context.  There's no evidence to support the claim that the individuals shown in the image are named Jo Dickinson, or that the location is Forest Lodge Garden Centre in Farnham, Surrey. The image itself could depict any garden center or similar setting where individuals are working with plants.  The internal check's moderate confidence score is overshadowed by the complete lack of external validation. Therefore, based on the available evidence, and prioritizing the absence of external validation, the conclusion is that the caption is out of context.  The significant conflict between internal and external checks necessitates a conservative approach. In the absence of robust confirming evidence, we must default to a low confidence score reflecting the considerable uncertainty in the caption's truthfulness. This reflects the standard practice of verification which prioritizes verifiable evidence and defaults to uncertainty when evidence is lacking.",

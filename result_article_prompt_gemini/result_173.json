        "content": "There are some good arguments for lowering the drinking age from 21: It is unpopular among most young adults; it arguably encourages underground binge drinking; enforcement is a complete failure on college campuses. And it is notable, of course, that an 18-year-old is considered an adult in almost every context -- including in the voting booth -- except when ordering a beer.\nBut research has shown that a drinking age of 21 does reduce alcohol use by those under 21, including high school students. Alcohol consumption by young adults has demonstrable and serious costs: for example, a lower drinking age leads to more traffic fatalities. Indeed, traffic accidents are a primary reason why Vietnam-era experimentation with lower drinking ages was abandoned. Other impacts of lowering the drinking age may be less obvious, but no less costly.\nMy research with Angela Fertig examined the impact of the drinking age by looking back at the 1980s, when many states moved from a minimum of 18 to 21. Our study found that a lower drinking age was associated with a statistically higher risk of unintended pregnancy and, largely as a result, worse infant health.\nResearch by economists Christopher Carpenter and Carlos Dobkin shows that arrest rates for violent and nuisance crimes rise sharply at age 21 and persist through at least age 23. A lower drinking age would likely cause this period of alcohol-related criminal activity to start earlier and last longer. Evidence also suggests that a lower drinking age leads to higher levels of binge drinking later in life among men.\nAny move toward increasing alcohol availability to young adults must consider its adverse effects, including traffic fatalities, unplanned pregnancy and crime. Policies like increased public transit availability, access to birth control and educational initiatives focused on harm reduction rather than abstinence have been shown to mitigate the detrimental effects of alcohol use by young adults. Lowering the drinking age will only succeed as part of a comprehensive set of policies that address the unintended consequences.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption \"The legal drinking age has been raised to 23\" is completely out of context with the provided image. The image depicts two glasses of flaming liquid, a visual element completely unrelated to any discussion about legal drinking age.  The internal check identifies a lack of any connection between the image content and the caption, assigning a confidence score of 0.  The external check corroborates this assessment by stating that news articles discussing changes to the legal drinking age focus primarily on lowering the age (often from 21 to 18) and the associated societal impacts. There is no evidence to suggest that the legal drinking age is being raised to 23 in any relevant context.  The external check also achieves a confidence score of 0.  The alignment between these two independent checks is perfect, reinforcing the conclusion that the caption is entirely unrelated to the image and therefore out of context.  The complete lack of any semantic or visual connection between the image and the caption eliminates any ambiguity or uncertainty.  There are no conflicting interpretations possible, and no need for further analysis or entity resolution techniques. The image solely represents a visual depiction of flaming cocktails.  The caption, on the other hand, represents a statement about legal changes concerning the consumption of alcohol. These two are unrelated concepts.  Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is justified based on the conclusive evidence provided by both the internal and external checks.  No additional information or analysis is required to establish the out-of-context nature of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks unequivocally confirm that the caption is unrelated to the image content. The lack of any connection between the visual elements and the caption's topic results in a high confidence assessment of out-of-context status."

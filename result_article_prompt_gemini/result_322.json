While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem's health quickly registered here at Snopes.\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem's lyrics. We're not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere's how this joke appeared on the \"Dad Jokes\" section of Reddit:\n\"In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

    "explanation": "The caption claims that Eminem was the first celebrity diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in February 2020.  Internal validation, while acknowledging the presence of Eminem in the image, finds the claim about his coronavirus diagnosis unconfirmed by the image itself. The confidence score for the internal check is 8, indicating a reasonable level of uncertainty due to the lack of visual evidence supporting the claim.  External validation, however, strongly refutes the caption's claim.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly states that the claim is false, originating as a joke repurposing Eminem's lyrics.  The confidence score for the external check is 10, representing a high degree of certainty based on the reliable source.  There is a strong agreement between the internal and external checks, both pointing towards the falsity of the caption.  The internal check highlights the lack of visual evidence, and the external check provides definitive evidence from a trusted source contradicting the claim.  The conflict is easily resolved because the external evidence is significantly more reliable and substantial than the absence of visual evidence in the image. Since there is no visual evidence within the image to support the caption's statement regarding Eminem's diagnosis, and a reliable external source explicitly debunks it, the caption is definitively out of context. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong and concordant results of both internal and external validation methods. The combined evidence leaves no room for doubt about the inaccuracy of the provided caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds no visual support for the claim, while the external check definitively refutes it using a reliable source.  There is complete agreement between the checks, resulting in high confidence that the caption is false."

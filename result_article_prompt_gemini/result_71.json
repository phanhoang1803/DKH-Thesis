In fact, users who clicked the above-displayed message were greeted with a popup message requesting permission from a Facebook app to post on their behalf, making the article appear less like a hoax and more like an outright scam:\nMessages about Jaden Smith's alleged suicide were shared from various sites, and led to a variety of dodgy-sounding Facebook apps, including \"Smart Mobiles,\" \"Gadgy Land,\" \"Pakiza,\" \"Top Feeds\" and several others.\nIntrepid internet users who clicked the link and gave the app permission were eventually greeted with one of several \"news\" story claiming that Jaden Smith had committed suicide. The web sites responsible for this hoax have published dozens of fake news stories and graphics with this false claim:\nUsers who granted these apps permission to post to Facebook on their behalf quickly found this death hoax posted to their own Facebook feeds, thereby replicating itself across social media.\nJaden Smith himself has been active on his social media accounts, seemingly unaware that he's supposed to be dead. He posted a photograph of himself on 27 July 2016:",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that actor Jaden Smith committed suicide in July 2016.  Both internal and external checks decisively refute this claim. \n\nInternal Check:\nThe internal check examines the provided image and caption for consistency. The image shows Will Smith and Jaden Smith, seemingly in a television interview setting. There is nothing in the image that suggests Jaden Smith committed suicide. The internal check finds a complete mismatch between the image's content and the caption's assertion.  The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete lack of support for the caption within the image. This constitutes strong evidence against the caption's accuracy.\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check uses the reputable fact-checking website Snopes.com to verify the claim. Snopes.com explicitly debunks the rumor that Jaden Smith committed suicide in July 2016, classifying it as a hoax spread via social media and malicious applications. The fact that Jaden Smith remained active on social media after the purported date of his death further supports the debunking. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check underscores the reliability of Snopes.com and the strength of its evidence contradicting the caption.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both independently and conclusively demonstrate that the caption is false. The image provides no support, and external fact-checking confirms the information in the caption is incorrect. The convergence of these findings reinforces the conclusion.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the overwhelming evidence from both internal and external checks, it is certain that the original caption is entirely out of context. The claim that Jaden Smith committed suicide in July 2016 is false.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects this certainty. The image and independent fact-checking align perfectly to disprove the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly and independently refute the caption.  The image shows no indication of the event described in the caption, and a reputable fact-checking website confirms the information is false. There is complete agreement between the checks, leading to a high confidence score."

How do I know this? Because if they tried praying to Satan just once, theyd be doing it every day. Multiple times per day. Its really that powerful. Its a real trip.\nSpeaking at a Stella McCartney fashion event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Katy Perry denied rumors that she has undergone plastic surgery, and instead attributed her refreshed look to a new spiritual outlook.\nAdvising everybody to add praying to Satan to your bucket list, Katy Perry compared her first time praying to Satan to a mythical movie, When Beckie Met Chad.\nThere is no evidence that the singer made these comments, although Perry did attend the star-studded Stella McCartney \"Stellabration\" fashion event and party in Los Angeles. She has often been the focus of moral panic-tinged occult rumors perhaps fueled by her professional progression from Christian-themed musician to sometimes-risque pop singer who campaigned for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (who is also often the focus of satanism and occult hoaxes).\nPerry's only on-the-record comment at the event that we could find was to the style and culture publication The Cut:\n[Stella McCartney] is the definition of good vibrations. Really, Stella, her work is so phenomenal, but she is such a good vibe. ... Its just always fun, thats why we come, because its not work. The clothes are so great, theyre just so architectural this season, and its just a big fat get together where we can be ourselves, conversate, and meet again. Im on the road so Im not able to go to a lot of these things, so its fun for me tonight.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a partial alignment, noting the presence of Katy Perry in both the image and caption, but flags the absence of Satan in the image, resulting in a low confidence score and a false verdict. The external check, however, provides strong evidence that the caption is entirely fabricated.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks the claim, citing its origin in a known purveyor of fake news and demonstrating that the purported quote from Katy Perry is entirely false. The high confidence score (10) from the external check, combined with the low confidence score (10) from the internal check, heavily outweighs the partial alignment found internally.  The external validation's evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context and factually inaccurate. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks stems from the different scopes of their analysis. The internal check focuses solely on the presence or absence of entities within the image and caption. It lacks the capability to verify the truthfulness of the statement. The external check, however, performs a fact-check, investigating the source of the claim and the evidence supporting it. Therefore, the external validation carries significantly more weight in determining the out-of-context nature of the caption.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check reflects the strong evidence from Snopes, a reputable source, and decisively refutes the claim. The conflict arises from the limitations of the internal check, which is designed for entity alignment rather than truth verification.  A thorough cross-validation considering both aspects affirms that the caption is out of context.  The image portrays Katy Perry at an award show; the caption attributes a false statement to her, creating a significant mismatch.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is out of context. The internal check flags the mismatch between the image and a central claim in the caption. The external check definitively confirms the caption's falsity through fact-checking, providing strong evidence from Snopes. The high confidence from the external check outweighs the partial match detected by the internal check. "

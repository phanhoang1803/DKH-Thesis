        "content": "The Bay Area has many murals, with images of everyone from Robin Williams to Nipsey Hussle gracing its buildings.\nNow, theres a new name to add to that list: Greta Thunberg.\nA mural of the Swedish teenage climate activist, whose movement has caught the attention of the world, is set to be completed next Tuesday.\nLocated in downtown San Francisco near Union Square (420 Mason St., for all you locals), the mural features Thunberg from the chest up  gazing straight into our souls, lips pursed.\nIts enough to make anyone stop and consider their environmental impact.\nAnd thats kind of the point, said Paul Scott, executive director of OneAtmosphere.org  the nonprofit thats funding the project.\nThe organization wanted to focus on art celebrating climate activists, Scott told CNN. When brainstorming people to feature, Thunberg was the first person that came to mind.\nIf we can amplify her message and get more people involved and listening to what shes saying, then were doing some good, he said.\nThe overall feedback has been incredibly positive, he said. But the most critical reactions have been from those who havent recognized her.\nTheyre struck by the image and want to learn more, he said. If they take the time to learn more about what shes trying to share, that I think has an impact on most people. Makes them want to help.\nAndrs Petreselli is the artist behind the mural. He also did the citys Robin Williams one, which is how Scott found his work.\nPetreselli is donating his time to the cause and told CNN he feels connected to everything Thunberg is doing. She sets examples for the whole world, he said.\nWere pretty much at the beginning of our extinction, so if we dont do anything right now, its going to be too late, he said.\nIts not the first mural to the young activist\nThunberg and her message have inspired murals around the world. One in Bristol, England, featuring the activist partly underwater went up earlier this year, along with another one in Canada.\nNot everyone has been eager to hear her message. The mural in Canada, painted on a free wall along a bike path, was defaced twice shortly after it was first created, according to CNN affiliate CBC.\nThe adversity hasnt stopped Thunberg, though.\nShe is best known for her climate strikes, which she began in 2018 outside the Swedish Parliament. Her protest inspired thousands of students around the world to walk out of class and demand action on the climate crisis.\nShe hasnt slowed down. Shes spoken to everyone from the United Nations to the US Congress  and even former President Barack Obama  about the climate crisis.",

        "content": "San Francisco, a city that prides itself on its eco-consciousness, will soon have a giant likeness of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg gazing upon its downtown, reminding residents to respect the planet.\nThe Argentinian muralist Andres Iglesias, who signs his art with the pseudonym Cobre, is expected to complete the project in the central Union Square neighborhood by next week, SFGate reported. Cobre also painted a revered mural of the comedian Robin Williams that has since been demolished.\nClimate change is real, Cobre told SFGate. This girl Greta is awesome and she knows what shes doing. I hope with this mural people will realize we have to take care of the world.\nThe environmental not-for-profit group One Atmosphere reportedly reached out to Cobre after the mural of Williams was slated to come down and just as Cobre was searching for a building for his next project. The organization is said to be supplying all the paint for the project.\nIts not the first time Thunberg has been immortalized in street art. Earlier this year, the UK-based aerosol artist Jody Thomas painted a 50ft portrait of the teenager on the face of the historic Tobacco Factory in Bristol.\nShes very much in the limelight, very current, very contemporary and shes obviously clearly leading a very, very important issue which affects all of us on the planet, Thomas told the Huffington Post.\nAt 16, Thunberg has already reached the exalted status of Nobel peace prize nominee, leader of a movement to reclaim the planet for future generations, focus of Donald Trumps mockery, and hero among progressives and young people.\nIn September, Thunberg became the face of a vast, coordinated strike to protest against government inaction on the climate crisis. Demonstrations spanned an estimated 185 countries in one of the largest environmental protests in history.\nYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet Im one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! Thunberg said, addressing the United Nations Climate Action Summit.\nMy message is that well be watching you, she said.",

    "explanation": "The caption \"Thunberg already has several murals around the world, this one in San Francisco\" is validated as accurate based on both internal and external checks. The internal check, with a high confidence score of 10, strongly supports the caption's accuracy by directly observing a mural of Greta Thunberg in what appears to be San Francisco from the image itself.  The entities 'Thunberg', 'San Francisco', and the depiction of a mural are all clearly aligned between the image and the caption. The external check, while slightly less confident at 8, provides corroborating evidence from multiple sources confirming the existence of multiple Greta Thunberg murals globally and specifically mentioning a new mural being created in San Francisco. This aligns perfectly with the caption's statement.  The external sources provide additional context supporting the claim that this San Francisco mural is not the first one, further strengthening the caption's accuracy.  Both the internal visual inspection and the external factual verification converge to support the claim. There are no significant discrepancies or conflicts between the internal and external checks. The high confidence scores from both checks and the strong alignment of entities across sources lead to a high overall confidence score of 9 for the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows a Greta Thunberg mural, and external sources confirm the existence of multiple such murals worldwide, including a new one in San Francisco."

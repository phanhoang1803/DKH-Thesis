        "content": "Claim:\nSamuel Pepys wrote about taverns being full of gadabouts during a plague in 1665.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn July 2020, a quote ostensibly written in 1665 by Samuel Pepys, dubbed the world's greatest diarist by some, started to circulate on social media. The passage lamented how \"gadabouts\" (defined by Cambridge Dictionary as \"a person who goes out a lot and does not worry about other things they should be doing\") were still frequenting taverns despite the risk of contracting the plague:\nThere are two slightly differing versions of the passage, one describing the taverns as \"full of gadabouts\" (as in the above meme), and the other describing them as \"fair full of gadabouts,\" as in the example below:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nSamuel Pepys, Great Plague 1665 MP and Diarist\n1633-1703\nThis is not a genuine quote from Pepys. This is a modern piece of writing that originated with a social media account parodying Pepys.\nPepys was a naval administrator and member of English Parliament. He was most famous, however, for recording a daily diary for nearly 10 years starting in 1660. Pepys wrote about several significant historical events during this time period, such as the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Great Fire of London, and the Great Plague of London in 1665. The above-displayed passage, however, was not written by him.\nThis quote originated with the Twitter account @Pepys_Diaries, a sort of parody account that reimagines Pepys as if he were a modern-day writer. This account provides a pretty big clue that these are not real quotes, as it uses the handle \"FakeyPepys.\" Also, it is noted in the account's bio that quotes from the real Pepys can be found on the Twitter account @SamuelPepys.\nOn March 20, 2020, the parody account posted the now-viral quote:\nOddly enough, this is not the only entity posting fake diary entries from Pepys as if they were written during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. On March 9, for instance, The Fence magazine published the \"Coronavirus Diaries of Samuel Pepys.\"\nPepysdiary.com, a website dedicated to Pepys' actual writings, addressed this misquote in a March 2020 article. The website noted that another quote from the parody account had also gone viral:\nTheres been a parody Samuel Pepys twitter account running for a while at @Pepys_Diaries. Its a modern-day take on Pepys, imagining him writing in the modern world. Unfortunately one of the accounts recent tweets, drawing parallels between the Plague and 2020s coronavirus, has been quoted out of context and spread around as if its a real excerpt from the diary. The tweet:\n\"On hearing ill rumour that Londoners may soon be urged into their lodgings by Her Majestys men, I looked upon the street to see a gaggle of striplings making fair merry, and no doubt spreading the plague well about. Not a care had these rogues for the health of their elders!\"\n(Update: Theres at least one more quote thats being passed around as if its genuine, but is also from the fake diary account:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nEnd update.)\nScreenshots of this, attributed to Samuel Pepys in 1664, get passed around Twitter and Facebook as if its a prescient example of Pepyss diarising. There are obvious things that point to why its not a real quote (as outlined in this Londonist article), and misuses of language that are apparent to those of us who read the real diary, but that doesnt stop those who arent too familiar with the period.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) that the image aligns with the caption's mention of Samuel Pepys. The external check, however, reveals a significant discrepancy.  It provides strong evidence (score 10) from a reputable source (Snopes) that directly contradicts the caption's claim. Snopes definitively states that the quote attributed to Pepys is false, originating from a parody Twitter account, not from Pepys' actual writings. This external validation is crucial as it provides factual evidence contradicting the caption's assertion. The conflict arises because while the image correctly identifies Samuel Pepys, the caption incorrectly attributes a fabricated quote to him.  The high confidence scores from both checks highlight the significance of this discrepancy. Therefore, a conservative approach based on the preponderance of evidence suggests that the caption is out of context. The internal check only verifies the presence of Samuel Pepys in the image, not the accuracy of the quote itself. The external check thoroughly investigates the origin and authenticity of the quote, providing irrefutable evidence that it is false. The weight of this external evidence significantly outweighs the internal check's alignment assessment, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  In summary, the image is verified, but the caption's claim is definitively debunked. The external validation's focus on source verification and factual accuracy makes it significantly more reliable than the internal check's focus on simple image-caption alignment. There is no uncertainty; the evidence clearly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check validates the image's subject; external check definitively debunks the quote's authenticity. The strong external evidence outweighs the internal alignment, indicating the caption is out of context."

Clicking through on the social media post led users to a rogue website which displayed a fake CNN video announcing the supposed \"shocking\" death of the Smiths (along with some other adult content):\nThe purpose of this hoax appeared to be to bait users into clicking to view the video as a means of driving them to malicious web pages, and to trick them into sharing the hoax post on social media in order to spread it further. Users are strongly advised not to visit to the website that underlies this hoax post and not to click on anything displayed there.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 10, points out a clear discrepancy: the image shows Will Smith and Jaden Smith alive and well at an event, directly contradicting the caption's claim of their death in a car crash.  The external check further reinforces this conclusion, achieving a confidence score of 10 by citing a Snopes article that explicitly debunks the false information about their deaths. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, confirms that the claim is a hoax and that neither Will nor Jaden Smith died or suffered serious injuries in any car accident.  There is no conflict between the internal and external assessments; both independently and decisively confirm the caption's falsehood and its lack of context relative to the image. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) leave no room for doubt. The caption is entirely fabricated and has no connection to the provided image.  The image content and the external verification from Snopes completely refute the caption's assertion. Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly support the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context. The image shows Will and Jaden Smith alive, while the caption falsely claims their death in a car accident.  External fact-checking confirms the caption as a hoax."

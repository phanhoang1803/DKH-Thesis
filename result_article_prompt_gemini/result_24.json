        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

The video depicts protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, tearing down a surveillance lamppost, not a 5G tower in China in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19.

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check flags a low confidence score (4) due to ambiguities in the video itself and the lack of visual verification for the stated intent (stopping COVID-19 spread).  The explanation highlights the disputed nature of the structures being destroyed and the uncertainty regarding the video's origin. More importantly, the external check provides a high confidence score (10), decisively refuting the caption's claim.  The external check leverages Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking source, which definitively establishes that the video depicts a protest in Hong Kong in August 2019, predating the COVID-19 pandemic. The structures destroyed were surveillance lampposts, not 5G towers, and the context was anti-surveillance protests, not COVID-19 prevention.  There is a clear and consistent mismatch between the original caption's narrative and the verifiable facts presented by the external source. Therefore, the high confidence score from the external validation overrides the lower score from the internal validation.  The significant discrepancy arises primarily from the misrepresentation of the video's content (type of structures destroyed, location, date, and the event's motivation).  The claim about COVID-19 prevention is entirely unfounded based on both checks, making the original caption's context severely inaccurate and misleading. In conclusion, overwhelming evidence points to a clear case of out-of-context information, making the \"OOC\" value \"true\" with a high confidence score of 10.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly indicate that the caption is out of context.  The external validation, using Snopes, decisively proves that the video's context is misrepresented, showing a Hong Kong protest in 2019, not a COVID-19 related event in China."

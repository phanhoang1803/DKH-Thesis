        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin hasnt been vaccinated against the coronavirus yet, months after he announced his countrys Sputnik V as the worlds first approved Covid-19 vaccine and said his own daughter had taken it.\nThe Kremlin said Tuesday that Putin cannot get a vaccine that has not yet finished the final stage of trials, even though the jab has already been given to some Russian frontline health care workers, teachers and several top level officials outside the clinical trials.\nThe President cannot use an uncertified vaccine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a call with reporters. Peskov did not explain the difference between the vaccine being certified and approved, but said: Mass vaccination has not started yet. And, of course, the head of state cannot take part in vaccination as a volunteer. Its impossible.\nPeskov said the trials should be completed soon and that Putin would inform people on his decision on whether to take the vaccine if he considers it necessary.\nThe news that Putin hasnt taken the vaccine yet came on the same day that Sputnik Vs developers published new information about the vaccine, touting it as effective, cheap and easy to transport.\nThe Gamaelya institute, which is developing the vaccine, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which finances it, reported more interim data on the vaccine on Tuesday. In a news releases, they said that analysis of data obtained 28 days after the first dose and seven days after the second dose suggests the Sputnik vaccine was 91.4% effective in preventing infections.\nThe release said the researchers identified 39 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the volunteers  31 in the placebo group and eight among those who received the vaccine. It added 18,794 volunteers took part in the study.\nPfizer and Moderna reported similar efficacy rates  94.5% for Moderna and 95% for Pfizer. However, their claims were based on larger sized clinical trials. Moderna reported 95 Covid-19 cases amongst its volunteers  90 in the placebo group and 5 in the vaccinated cohort, while Pfizer reported 170 cases  162 in the placebo group and eight in the participants who received the vaccine.\nAstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70%. It said a total of 131 study participants developed Covid-19 but did not say how many of those people had received the Covid-19 vaccine and how many did not.\nIn a separate statement, the Gamaelya institute and the RDIF said one dose of the vaccine will cost less than $10 on international markets, which they said was two or more times cheaper than mRNA vaccines with similar efficacy levels. The two-dose vaccine and vaccination will be free of charge for Russian citizens, the statement added. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines.\nIn the statement on Tuesday, Russia also said the Sputnik vaccine can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, which is similar to what AstraZeneca said about its vaccine on Monday.\nMeanwhile, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at around -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) while its transported. Moderna said its vaccine can be kept in freezers typically available in pharmacies, and in a refrigerator for 30 days.\nPutin first announced Russias vaccine was approved for public use in August, even though at that point it had been tested only on several dozen subjects in a non-blind study. The announcement came before the start of Phase 3 trials, which are key to establishing its safety and efficacy, and drew skepticism from the international community.\nI know that it works quite effectively, it forms a stable immunity, Putin said at the time, adding that one of his daughters had already taken the jab  a rare move from the President, who is notoriously secretive about his family. He said she had a slightly higher temperature after each dose, but added now she feels well.\nPutin, at 68 years old, is in a high risk group. Vaccine trials for the first group of volunteers aged 60 and over began on October 28, according to Russian state new agency TASS.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that Putin's daughter died after taking her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  The provided text from CNN only states that Putin's daughter experienced a slightly elevated temperature after each dose, but that she felt fine afterward. There is no mention of her death in the article.  Therefore, the caption is completely unsubstantiated by the provided source.",

    "explanation": "The claim in the caption, \"Putin’s daughter had died after taking her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine,\" is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The image itself shows a young woman getting her blood pressure checked, a routine medical procedure unrelated to the death of a person after a COVID-19 vaccination.  There is no visual information connecting the image to Putin, his daughter, or any COVID-19 vaccination. This lack of alignment represents a significant internal inconsistency.  Furthermore, external verification strengthens the conclusion that the caption is entirely fabricated.  External sources, such as the referenced CNN article, explicitly contradict the caption's assertion. While the article discusses Putin's daughter receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it explicitly states that she experienced only mild side effects, such as a slightly elevated temperature, but ultimately felt fine afterward. The absence of any mention of her death in the cited article, a critical piece of information, clearly indicates the caption's falsity. The high confidence score stems from the perfect agreement between internal and external checks. Both methods independently confirm the caption's lack of correlation with the image content and its direct contradiction of reliable external information.  There's no conflict between the internal and external analyses; both robustly point to the caption being entirely unfounded and misleading.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly support the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context. The image depicts a routine medical examination, while the caption falsely claims the death of Putin's daughter from a COVID-19 vaccine, a fact directly refuted by referenced external sources."

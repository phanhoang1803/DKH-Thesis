    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content.  The image clearly depicts a woman who resembles Harriet McAtee, practicing yoga on a narrowboat.  The setting appears consistent with Oxford. However, the external check shows zero confidence (0) because the provided related article lacks specific information supporting the caption's claim about Harriet McAtee's yoga class on a narrowboat in Oxford. The article is too general to offer verification.  This significant discrepancy between internal and external checks necessitates a low overall confidence score.  Because the external validation failed to confirm the caption's details, the caption is deemed out of context despite the strong visual correlation in the image. Further investigation is needed to confirm the caption's veracity beyond visual interpretation of the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on image content; external check finds no supporting evidence, resulting in a low confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

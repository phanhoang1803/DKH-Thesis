        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Joe Biden on a movie set designed to look like the Oval Office.\nVoting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.\nIn February 2021, a few weeks after Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, a few social media users appeared to be in denial of reality as they held on to the idea that former President Donald Trump was somehow still the commander in chief. When a photo of Biden in the Oval Office started circulating online, they claimed that the photo was not taken at the White House but actually showed a movie set:\nThis photograph was taken on Feb. 5, 2021, as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a meeting in the actual Oval Office to discuss their COVID-19 relief package. ABC News reported:\nIn an Oval Office meeting with House Democrats on Friday, Biden recounted how as vice president, then-President Barack Obama had tasked him with pushing through legislation on Capitol Hill to address the recession.\n\"It was hard as hell to get the votes for it to begin with, and then it was hard as hell to get even the number we got,\" Biden said at the start of the gathering. \"But one thing we learned is, you know, we can't do too much here; we can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.\"\nThe claim that this photograph was taken on a movie set is based entirely on what appears, at first glance, to be a crack in the wall behind Biden. This crack, however, simply shows a partially opened door.\nThe Oval Office has four doors, two of which were designed to blend in with the walls. Here's a photograph of Trump that shows the same \"crack\" that can be seen in the viral image of Biden. In the Trump photo, it's clear that this \"crack\" is just a door:\nWhile these \"hidden\" doors may conjure up thoughts of secret passages or escape pathways, there isn't anything secret about these doors. They are just normal doors that open up to rooms adjacent to the Oval Office. The decision to blend them into the walls appears to have been a purely aesthetic choice.\nHere's another video from the Oval Office that showcases these doors. In 2010, former President Barack Obama met with some students featured in the documentary \"Waiting for Superman.\" At one point, one of the kids asks Obama about these strange looking doors:",

      "explanation": "The news caption is supported by Source 1, which explicitly states that a photograph shows President Biden in what some claimed was a movie set designed to resemble the Oval Office.  Snopes investigates this claim, revealing it to be a false assertion based on a misinterpretation of a door in the Oval Office. While the caption doesn't explicitly state the claim is false, the article directly addresses the image and the context of its origin, providing crucial context absent in the caption.  The high confidence score reflects the direct address of the caption's central claim within a reliable fact-checking source.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses some uncertainty, giving a confidence score of 8 and acknowledging that the image alone doesn't definitively prove the setting is a movie set. However, it leans towards true because the presence of Biden in what appears to be the Oval Office makes the claim plausible, albeit not conclusively proven from the image itself. The external check provides critical information from Source 1. This source initially supports the caption's claim but then reveals that the claim is false after investigation.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking site, determines the claim is a misinterpretation, demonstrating a crucial discrepancy. The caption lacks the crucial context provided by the external source that refutes its assertion. The conflict lies in the initial plausibility of the caption (based on the picture's appearance and Biden's presence) versus the definitive external refutation. The external validation carries more weight due to its investigative nature and reliance on a verifiable fact-checking source. This external evidence definitively shows the caption is inaccurate. This discrepancy is resolved by prioritizing the external validation, which is based on investigation and fact-checking. Considering both, a high confidence (9) is assigned to the conclusion that the caption is out of context because the picture was indeed taken in the actual Oval Office, not a movie set.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows some uncertainty but leans towards accepting the caption. External validation decisively refutes the caption's claim using evidence from a fact-checking source, revealing it is false. The external evidence is prioritized due to its investigative nature and reliability. The final assessment is that the caption is out of context."

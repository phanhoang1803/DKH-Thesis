        "content": "Claim:\nA video documents the U.S. Navy's wasteful practice of launching pickup trucks into the water.\nOn 9 February 2019, the Facebook page \"The Other 98%\" posted a video that supposedly showed a truck being launched via a catapult off the deck of the USS Gerald Ford. The video was accompanied by a message suggesting that the United States could easily afford to pay for the Green New Deal proposed in Congress or Medicare for all since the Navy was wasting so much money dumping trucks into the water:\nThe text overlaid on the video reads: \"Trucks were just launched off the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to test its jet catapult system. Don't ever let anyone tell you we can't afford Medicare for all or the Green New Deal.\"\nSeveral things are wrong with this assertion:\nThis incident didn't \"just\" happen. The video is from 2015.\nThe object being launched is not a commercially available truck. This is actually a weighted sled (referred to by the Navy as a dead load).\nThese sleds can be retrieved from the bottom of the river.\nEconomic estimates for the proposed Green New Deal or Medicare for All vary, but they can't be compared to the cost of a few wasted pickup trucks.\nThis viral clip originated with a video uploaded to the U.S. Navy's YouTube page in 16 June 2015 and shows a test of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), a catapult system designed to launch aircraft. At the time, the Navy was using dead loads to mimic the weight of an aircraft:\nHere's a better look at the \"truck\" in the video:\nThe viral Facebook video suggests that the Navy was being wasteful, as these \"trucks\" were lost and left to decay in the water. But that's not always the case. These tests were conducted in the relatively shallow waters of the James River (as opposed to the ocean) and can usually be retrieved for additional tests. A contemporary report from Engadget noted that this specific sled (which was not equipped with any electronics, an engine, or any other especially expensive materials) was recovered from the James River:\nThe Navy has been testing the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System or EMALS for months aboard the Gerald R. Ford carrier, but this is the first time a \"dead-load\" (or a weighted steel sled that weighs up to 80,000 pounds) is involved. Its advantages over traditional catapults that use steam instead of electromagnetic energy include smoother acceleration and its ability to place less stress on the aircraft -- plus, it was designed to work even with more advanced carriers that the military will surely use in the future. It will take a long time before any plane goes near the system, though: the Navy has already retrieved the sled above from the depths of the James River to conduct more dead-load launches.\nIn July 2017, the first fixed-wing airplane was launched using EMALS:\nWhile one could certainly argue that the U.S. government wastes money on certain projects that would be better spent on more worthwhile endeavors, this viral Facebook video isn't the best example to support this argument. This \"truck\" is actually a weighted sled and wasn't lost to the water.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is largely supported by Source 1, which describes a video showing a weighted sled, referred to as a \"dead load\", being launched from the USS Gerald Ford using its Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS).  While the caption refers to a \"truck\", the article clarifies that it was not a standard truck, but a weighted sled designed to simulate the weight of an aircraft during testing. The article also mentions the event took place in 2015 and that the sled was later recovered. This aligns with the main claim of the caption, although it corrects the description of the object launched.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a discrepancy: while the image shows the USS Gerald Ford, it does not depict a truck being launched. The external check, however, supports a modified version of the caption. It clarifies that the object launched was a weighted sled, not a truck, simulating aircraft weight during EMALS testing.  The external check's high confidence score (8) stems from corroborating evidence from a news article describing the 2015 test. This suggests the original caption was inaccurate in its description of the launched object but correct in identifying the location (USS Gerald Ford) and the general nature of the event (a launch from the carrier). The conflict lies in the object description.  The internal check rightly points out the lack of visible truck launch.  The external check provides the correct identification of the object as a weighted sled, a fact not apparent in the image. Because the external evidence is stronger and more specific, the caption is deemed out of context, although the core event is true.  The confidence score reflects the high certainty of the external evidence, balanced by the internal check's accurate assessment of the image's content. The summary reflects this analysis, emphasizing the discrepancy but also recognizing the validity of the main elements of the event reported, albeit with a corrected description of the object being launched.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as inaccurate due to the absence of a truck launch in the image. External check validates a modified version: a weighted sled, not a truck, was launched during EMALS testing aboard the USS Gerald Ford. This leads to an OOC verdict, reflecting the inaccurate object description, despite the correct carrier identification."

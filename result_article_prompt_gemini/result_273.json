On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the photograph depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal validation finds no evidence within the image itself to support the caption's assertions. The photograph shows a young girl with a visibly distended abdomen, sitting on a hospital bed. However, the image provides no information regarding the girl's age or the cause of her abdominal distension.  The absence of any contextual clues within the image makes it impossible to verify the caption's claims internally. The confidence score for the internal check is 0, reflecting the complete lack of supporting evidence in the image.\n\nExternal validation, on the other hand, utilizes information from a reliable source (Snopes) to directly contradict the original caption. Snopes explicitly debunks the claim, providing evidence that the photograph is miscaptioned and shows a young girl suffering from an enlarged liver and spleen, not pregnancy.  The Snopes article traces the origin of the photograph and explains its misuse to spread Islamophobic rumors.  The high confidence score of 10 for the external check highlights the strong and reliable evidence provided by the Snopes fact-check. \n\nThere is no conflict between the internal and external checks. Both independently reach the same conclusion: the original caption is factually inaccurate and misleading. The internal check emphasizes the lack of evidence within the image itself, while the external check offers conclusive evidence from a credible source debunking the caption's narrative.  The combined weight of both checks results in a high overall confidence score of 10, with the external evidence dominating due to its direct refutation of the false narrative.\n\nThe discrepancies highlighted are significant because they demonstrate the dangers of misinformation spread through miscaptioned images. The original caption deliberately connects an unrelated medical condition to a false narrative involving religious prejudice. The use of a fact-checking website like Snopes is crucial in identifying and correcting such misinformation.\n\nIn conclusion, both internal and external analyses strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The image does not depict what the caption claims, and a reliable external source confirms its inaccuracy and harmful nature.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly refute the original caption.  Internal analysis finds no supporting evidence in the image, while external validation from Snopes definitively debunks the claim, revealing the photograph depicts a girl with a medical condition, not a pregnancy."

        "content": "Watch the turnout figures  they can be a big giveaway.\nYou never get a 98% or 99% turnout in an honest election. You just don't.\nVoting is compulsory in Gabon, but it is not enforced; even in Australia where it is enforced, where you can vote by post or online and can be fined for not voting, turnout only reaches 90-95%.\nThe main reason that a full turnout is practically impossible is that electoral registers, even if they are recently compiled, can rarely be 100% up-to-date.\nEven if no-one gets sick or has to travel, people still die. And when a register is updated, new voters are keen to add themselves to the list.\nNo-one, however, has any great enthusiasm for removing the names of those who have died, and over time the number of these non-existent voters increases.\nI once reported on an election in the Niger Delta where some areas had a turnout of more than 120%.\n\"They're very healthy people round here, and very civic-minded,\" a local official assured me.\nBut a turnout of more than 100%, in an area or an individual polling station, is a major red flag and a reason to cancel the result and re-run the election.\nEven where the turnout is within the bounds of possibility, if the figure is wildly different from the turnout elsewhere, it serves as a warning.\nWhy would one particular area, or one individual polling station, have a 90% turnout, while most other areas register less than 70%?\nSomething strange is almost certainly going on, especially if the high turnout is an area which favours one particular candidate or party over another.\nWhen the polls close, and before they open the boxes, election officials normally have to go through a complicated and rather tedious process known as the reconciliation of ballots.\nAfter they have counted how many ballot papers they received in the morning, they then need to count how many are left, and how many  if any  were torn or otherwise spoiled and had to be put aside.\nThe result will tell them how many papers should be in the box. It should also match the number of names checked off on the register.\nThe first task when the box is opened is to count the number of papers inside, this is done prior to counting the votes for the different candidates.\nIf there is a discrepancy, something is wrong. And if there are more papers in the boxes than were issued by the polling staff, it is highly likely that someone has been doing some \"stuffing\".\nThat's a good enough reason to cancel the result and arrange a re-run.\nMobile phones have made elections much more transparent.\nIt is now standard practice to allow party agents, observers and sometimes even voters to watch the counting process and take photographs of the results sheet with their phones.\nThey then have proof of the genuine results from their area  just in case the ones announced later by the electoral commission don't match.\nIt has clearly taken crooked politicians some time to catch up with the fact that people will now know if they change the results.\nWhere these systems have proved too demanding for the context, as in Malawi last year, they can actually increase delays as staff struggle to make the technology work.\nIn that particular case the results eventually had to be transmitted the old fashioned way; placed in envelopes and driven down to the capital under police escort.\nBy then, allegations of rigging were flying.\nDelay is certainly dangerous, fuelling rumours of results being \"massaged\" before release and increasing tensions, but this is not incontrovertible proof of rigging.",

While Source 1 discusses election processes, including ballot counting and potential irregularities, it does not contain information specific to Congo's 2023 elections or the described scene of an agent marking votes on a blackboard.

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The person in the image appears to be an election official tallying votes, and the vest partially displays \"CENI\", aligning with the caption's description. However, the external check reveals low confidence (4), indicating a lack of corroborating evidence from external sources. The external check points out the absence of specific details about Congo's 2023 elections in the provided text, making it impossible to confirm the caption's claim.  The conflict arises from the discrepancy in confidence scores between the internal and external checks. While the image strongly suggests vote counting, the external validation lacks sufficient information to confirm the specific context of the election.  This conflict necessitates a conservative approach in determining the final verdict. Given the lack of external corroboration for the specific context (Congo's election), despite the strong internal alignment, we must err on the side of caution and label the caption as potentially out of context.  The external evidence, or rather lack thereof, significantly weakens the overall confidence level. A higher confidence score would require external sources directly confirming this specific event of vote counting in Congo's elections.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton got her wish that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought.\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, its an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims Hillary Clinton \"got her wish\" that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.  Snopes, a fact-checking website, rates this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"  While the meme uses a real photo, the quote attributed to Clinton is fabricated.  The article traces the false quote back to 2016 and describes how it is based on a misrepresentation of her remarks to Goldman Sachs. Therefore, the articles contradict the caption's assertion that Clinton wished for Trump's candidacy.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's alignment with the image, as both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are clearly visible. However, the external check contradicts this with a low confidence score (3) and strong evidence that the quote attributed to Hillary Clinton is fabricated. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, verifies that the quote is a misrepresentation of Clinton's remarks. This discrepancy necessitates a careful analysis. While the image itself is authentic, the caption's claim that Hillary Clinton \"got her wish\" about Donald Trump running for office is demonstrably false based on external evidence. The external evidence provides strong and reliable support for its claim, making the fabricated quote the decisive factor.  The high internal confidence score stems from the straightforward entity alignment, which is not disputed. The conflict arises from the interpretation of the image's context, not from a disagreement about the image itself. Therefore, despite the high internal confidence, the external verification outweighs it due to the strong evidence of the fabricated quote.  The overall assessment leans heavily on the external validation because the core claim of the caption is demonstrably false.  The image does not validate the statement, only the presence of both individuals.  The weight of evidence from a reputable fact-checking source is more significant than a simple visual verification.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in entity alignment, while the external check reveals the caption's core claim (Clinton wishing for Trump's candidacy) is fabricated, leading to an out-of-context assessment."

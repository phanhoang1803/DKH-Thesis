        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a member of the October 2018 Central American migrant caravan urinating on an U.S. flag.\nA caravan of asylum seekers heading toward the United States border from Guatemala in the fall of 2018 was seized on as a campaign issue by many politicians heading into the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. As with most hot-button political issues, internet trolls quickly spread hoaxes and unfounded rumors maligning the caravan group.\nOn 2 November 2018, a social media user shared a photograph to the \"Bill O'Reilly Fans\" Facebook group that supposedly depicted a scene in which \"migrants in the Guatemalan Caravan stand on, and then urinate on, U.S. flag before throwing it in the trash can\":\nBut the image depicted none of those claimed aspects: It was several years old (not recent), was taken in the United States (not along the caravan), and didn't capture anyone urinating on a flag.\nThis photograph was snapped in April 2016 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee before a campaign appearance there by then-candidate Donald Trump, and it shows a protester standing (not urinating) on a U.S. flag.\nA news account from Milwaukee television station WITI stated that the protester \"stomped\" on the flag but did not report that anyone urinated on the flag:\nThere were protesters outside the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Mainstage Theatre, where Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was set to host a Fox News Channel town hall event scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on campus. Fox News Anchor Greta Van Susteren moderated the event.\nA FOX6 News crew estimated there to be about 70 to 100 protesters on hand outside the theatre. Most were a part of the group #WeLove, which was started on Facebook.\nAn exchange occurred after a protester was seen stomping on an American flag outside the theatre ...\nSome weren't happy to see protesters disrespecting the American flag. FOX6 News is told the man who pulled out the American flag and stood on it was not affiliated with the #WeLove group.\n\"That`s our flag. That`s our country. I mean, that's -- we've got family members, they've got family members that died for their right to do that and there is just no gratefulness, no respect. There's no appreciation and it makes me sick. It thoroughly makes me sick. I think it's sad,\" James Turk said.\nMedia Milwaukee, the university's student newspaper, provided some additional context about the protest:\nVaun Mays stood silently among the more vocal protesters, distanced from the crowd, with his feet firmly planted on top of an American flag laying across the cement. Mays wasnt yelling, he wasnt shouting, he stood -- silently. He had a message to share for those who were interested in hearing it, justifying his controversial treatment of the American flag.\nIt is unknown if Mays was directly affiliated with the rest of the protests or if he was acting on his own accord.\nIm here [against] Trump, and Im also here to call at hypocrisy and racism of America, said Mays. Part of this [Trumps] message is to Make America Great Again. What America is he talking about? We all know the past of America. I always get resistance for this; people take it personally. Its not aimed at any person or group of people, not against vets or white people in particular; its my own personal message.\nThe original photograph can be seen here, and a video report on the protest from WITI can be viewed below:",

    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image depicts a significant amount of discarded items, suggesting a hasty departure which aligns with the narrative of a migrant caravan leaving behind trash.  However, the external check expresses low confidence (3) and contradicts this assessment, stating there's no evidence linking the image to a migrant caravan in any reliable source. This significant discrepancy necessitates a closer examination. The internal check's high confidence is based on visual interpretation; the presence of personal belongings like a stroller supports a hasty exodus.  Yet, this is merely circumstantial evidence. The external check's low confidence stems from the absence of supporting evidence from reliable sources connecting the image specifically to a migrant caravan.  Without corroborating information from external sources, the internal interpretation remains speculative. The lack of context surrounding the photograph within the external resources prevents a definitive conclusion about the trash's origin.  While the image visually suggests the caption could be accurate, this visual interpretation is insufficient to override the absence of external verification. Therefore, considering the conflicting assessments and the lack of conclusive external evidence, we label the caption as out of context. The confidence score reflects this uncertainty: a low score because while the image plausibly suggests a migrant caravan, the absence of verifiable external sources undermines the claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on image content. However, the external check finds no supporting evidence linking the image to a migrant caravan, resulting in a conflict and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

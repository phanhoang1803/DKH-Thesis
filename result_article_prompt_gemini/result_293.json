One such example  supposedly originating with the medical sage known as \"old Chinese doctor\"  held that consuming a bowl of boiled garlic water would \"improve and cure\" persons afflicted with the malady overnight:\nGarlic has long been claimed as possessing qualities that aid in the prevention and treatment of various illnesses, including colds and flu, but scientific evidence supporting such claims is weak or lacking.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) specifically addressed this rumor in reference to COVID-19 and noted that although \"garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties,\" there's no evidence that \"eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus\":\nBBC News similarly reported of this rumor that:\nIn lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren't harmful in themselves, as long as they aren't preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be.\nThe South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic.\nWe know, in general, that eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water can be good for staying healthy. However, there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus.\nOn the plus side, this \"treatment\" might help keep away others who could potentially infect you.",

      "explanation": "The news caption's claim that consuming boiled garlic water would \"improve and cure\" coronavirus overnight is directly addressed and refuted by the provided article from Snopes.  The article explicitly states that this claim originated online and lacks scientific evidence. While the article acknowledges garlic's potential antimicrobial properties, it emphasizes that there's no evidence it protects against the coronavirus. The Snopes article cites the WHO and BBC News, adding to its reliability. The caption's claim is therefore contradicted by the article's reporting and the consensus of cited sources.",

    "explanation": "The internal check and the external check both strongly agree that the caption is out of context. The internal check notes that the image shows a bunch of garlic bulbs, while the caption makes a factually incorrect claim about consuming boiled garlic water curing coronavirus. The external check corroborates this by citing a Snopes article that refutes the claim in the caption. The Snopes article indicates that the claim lacks scientific evidence and is based on online misinformation, highlighting the discrepancy between the image and the caption's misleading information.  Both the internal and external checks provide strong evidence supporting the conclusion that the caption is out of context, resulting in a high confidence score. There is a strong agreement between the internal and external validation results and no discrepancies to resolve.",

One popular versions, which garnered tens of thousands of shares, was posted to the \"Amazing World\" Facebook page in April 2017 with the query \"Insane Cliff House ? Would you live in it?\":\nThis is not a genuine photograph of a habitable (or even existent) home on the underside of a cliff. Rather, it's a piece of digital art created as part of an advertising campaign for a concrete adhesive.\nThis \"Insane Cliff House\" image was one of several produced by the creative advertising agency JWT in 2013 to promote a line of Fester brand construction products. The \"Somos ms de lo que imaginas\" (\"We are more than you imagine\") campaign pictured Henkel's line of Fester construction products performing amazing and improbable feats, such as securing a house (with a pool) to the underside of a cliff.\nThe brand shared a version of the print advertisement on their Facebook page:",

    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the caption as accurate based solely on the image content.  It notes the depiction of a house built under a cliff, seemingly inhabitable due to visible interior details. However, the external check, referencing Snopes.com, provides strong evidence contradicting this assessment.  Snopes definitively states the image is not a real photograph of a habitable house but a digitally created piece of advertising art. This external evidence carries significant weight due to its source (a reputable fact-checking website) and its direct refutation of the caption's claim. The high confidence score of 10 from both checks reflects the strength of their respective evidence. The discrepancy arises from the limited perspective of the internal check, which only analyzes the visual content and not the image's origin or factual basis. The external check, in contrast, provides crucial context that overrules the internal interpretation.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because the image it describes is not a real-world depiction but a digital creation. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence from both checks, leading to a definitive conclusion despite the conflicting interpretations. In summary, while the image itself appears to show a house under a cliff, confirming the internal check's assessment, external verification reveals this to be a digital creation, not an actual building, contradicting the caption's claim of depicting a \"real, inhabitable house.\"",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check:  Image shows a house under a cliff, seemingly inhabitable. External check: Snopes.com confirms the image is a digital artwork, not a real building.  External evidence strongly contradicts the caption, leading to a final OOC verdict."

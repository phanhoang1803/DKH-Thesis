There is no visual evidence supporting the claim in the caption about China seeking approval to kill coronavirus patients.  The caption's entities are partially present; \"China\" is plausible given the context of the image, but the reference to killing patients is not visually supported.  The \"Coronavirus\" entity is implicit (the protective gear suggests a contagious disease context) but not explicitly shown.",

        "content": "Claim:\nChinese officials are seeking approval to start the mass killing of 20,000 people in order to stop the spread of new coronavirus.\nOn Feb. 5, 2020, the website AB-TC (aka City News) published an article that claimed Chinese officials were seeking approval from the Supreme Peoples Court to start the mass killing of 20,000 people infected with the new coronavirus in an attempt to contain the disease:\nChina seek for courts approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus\nThe highest level of court in Chhina [sic], Supreme Peoples Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.\nThe State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.\nThis is not a genuine news report. While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet's reporting.\nFor starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \"BREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\" But Shurmur didn't die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.\nThe website has also published hoax articles about \"cannibal restaurants\" (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\nThis website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:\nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News' website\nOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called City News published an article titled BREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\nAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\nNone of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person's byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called \"local correspondents.\"\nIn other words, this website doesn't exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting.\nIn addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC's article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \"document\" or a \"press conference,\" they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \"the state\" or \"the court\" or an \"official\" made a statement, but doesn't provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\nLastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China \"ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.\" That report, of course, made no mention of \"mass killings.\"\nThere is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China website.\nAB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we've concluded that this report is indeed false.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is FALSE.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, directly debunks the claim that China is seeking approval to kill 20,000 coronavirus patients.  The source of the false claim is identified as a website with a history of publishing misinformation and fake news. Snopes highlights several examples of previous false reporting by this website, further diminishing its credibility.  No other reliable news sources corroborate the claim, and Snopes points out that even the original source provides no evidence to support its assertion.  The claim is therefore completely unsubstantiated and contradicted by the fact-checking analysis.",

    "explanation": "The original caption, \"China Seeking Approval to Kill 20,000 Coronavirus Patients,\" is completely out of context with the provided image. The image depicts a medical worker assisting a patient in an ambulance, a scene consistent with providing medical care, not mass killings.  \n\nThe internal check assesses the image's content and finds no visual evidence to support the caption's claim. The confidence score of 3 reflects the partial presence of the entity \"China\" (plausible given the global context of the pandemic) but the complete absence of any visual indication of the alleged mass killings. The lack of visual support for the core claim significantly lowers the confidence in the caption's accuracy.\n\nThe external check leverages fact-checking from Snopes, a reputable source. Snopes definitively debunks the caption's claim, rating it as false. They provide strong evidence that the original source of the claim is a known disseminator of misinformation.  Snopes highlights the absence of supporting evidence from the original source and the lack of corroboration from any credible news outlet. The confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence presented by Snopes to refute the claim.\n\nBoth internal and external checks align perfectly, strongly supporting the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There are no discrepancies between the checks; both consistently identify the caption as false and lacking evidentiary support. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check is reinforced by the internal check's assessment. The alignment of both checks eliminates any uncertainty, leading to a high overall confidence score.\n\nThe entity analysis aligns with this conclusion. The entities present in the image (\"medical worker,\" \"patient,\" \"ambulance\") strongly contrast with the entities in the caption (\"China,\" \"killing,\" \"20,000 coronavirus patients\"). The absence of any visual elements related to mass killings, government actions, or high death tolls further underscores the disconnect. The incongruence between the image's entities and the caption's entities provides further support for the OOC judgment.\n\nIn summary, the combination of internal image analysis showing a lack of evidence to support the claim and the external validation from a reliable fact-checker definitively establishes the caption's inaccuracy and its complete lack of fit with the image.  The consensus from both internal and external checks, combined with the entity analysis, provides an extremely high level of confidence in concluding that the caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds no visual evidence supporting the claim; the external check uses a reputable fact-checker (Snopes) that definitively debunks the claim.  There is complete agreement between the checks, leading to a high confidence score."

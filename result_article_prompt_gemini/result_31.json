        "content": "Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

        "content": "When a 100-pound shipment of lobsters arrived at Bill Sarro's seafood shop and restaurant last month, it contained a surprise  six orange crustaceans that have been said to be a 1-in-10-million oddity.\n\"My butcher was unloading them and said, 'Oh, my gosh, boss, they sent us cooked dead lobsters,'\" said Sarro, owner of Fresh Catch Seafood in Mansfield, Mass. \"He then picked one up and it crawled up his arm.\"\nReports of odd-colored lobsters used to be rare in the lobster fishing grounds of New England and Atlantic Canada. Normal lobsters are a mottled greenish-brown.\nBut in recent years, accounts of bright blue, orange, yellow, calico, white and even split lobsters  one color on one side, another on the other  have jumped. It's now common to hear several stories a month of a lobsterman bringing one of the quirky crustaceans to shore.\nIt's anybody's guess why more oddities are popping up in lobster traps, said Michael Tlusty, research director at the New England Aquarium in Boston.\nIt could be simply because advances in technology  cellphone cameras and social media  make it easier to spread the word about bizarre lobster sightings.\nIt's also likely more weird lobsters are being caught because the overall harvest has soared. In Maine, the catch has grown fourfold in the past 20 years, to nearly 105 million pounds last year. If the yield has quadrupled, it would make sense to have four times as many unconventional lobsters being caught as well.\nAlthough lobster is the No. 1 commercial fishery in the Northeast, there are a lot of unanswered questions about the bottom-dwelling creatures, he said.\n\"Are we seeing more because the Twitter sphere is active and people get excited about colorful lobsters?\" Tlusty said. \"Is it because we're actually seeing an upswing in them? Is it just that we're catching more lobsters so we have the opportunity to see more?\n\"Right now you can make a lot of explanations, but the actual data to find them out just isn't there.\"\nLobsters come in a variety of colors because of genetic variations.\nIt's been written that the odds of catching a blue lobster are 1-in-2 million, while orange comes in at 1-in-10 million. Yellow and orange-and-black calico lobsters have been pegged at 1-in-30 million, split-colored varieties at 1-in-50 million, and white  the rarest of all  at 1-in-100 million.\nBut those are merely guesses, and nobody knows for sure.\nWhat is known is that colored lobsters have shown up in greater frequency in certain areas over the years.\nThe waters off Cutler in eastern Maine were once a hotbed for blue ones, after 1,500 larvae-sized blue lobsters were released in 1990 to use as a tracking tool to determine their survival rates, said Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine's Lobster Institute.\nThe waters off Montauk, N.Y., once had a lot of blue lobsters as well, he said, after researchers released large numbers of blue lobsters there. The bright-orange lobsters that were in Sarro's shipment are believed to have come from the same waters in Canada.\nAside from their color, the lobsters are apparently normal in all other ways, Bayer said. They all turn red when they're cooked, except for the white ones since they don't have any pigment, and diners wouldn't notice a difference.\n\"There's no difference in taste,\" he said.\nScientists say it's possible the lobster population as a whole has a greater percentage of misfits than it did in years past.\nThe off-colored lobsters are more susceptible to predators because they stick out more on the ocean bottom, rather than blending in like normal ones, said Diane Cowan, executive director of The Lobster Conservancy in Friendship, Maine.\n\"But with the predator population down, notably cod, there might be greater survival rates among these color morphs that are visually easier to pick out,\" she said.\nLobstermen have brought Cowan countless colorful lobsters over the years. The prettiest one, she said, was pink and purple.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives high confidence (10) to the caption's accuracy, based on the image depicting a purple lobster and the caption's mention of a Maine lobsterman.  However, the external validation check provides a low confidence score (3) and directly contradicts the caption's claim.  Source 1 explicitly states that the image of the purple lobster is digitally manipulated and not a genuine photograph of a lobster caught by a Maine lobsterman.  Source 2, while mentioning unusually colored lobsters, doesn't support the existence of a purple lobster caught in Maine. This conflict between the internal and external checks necessitates a careful consideration of the evidence.  The high internal confidence score is primarily based on the visual appearance of the image, which is easily manipulated. This makes the internal check susceptible to deception.  The external check, despite a low confidence score, presents concrete evidence of the image's manipulation, negating the internal check's high confidence. This strongly suggests the caption is out of context. Therefore, the final confidence score reflects the uncertainty introduced by the contradictory evidence, where the external evidence of image manipulation holds more weight.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation highly supports the caption, while external validation strongly refutes it, citing evidence that the image is digitally manipulated.  The external evidence is given more weight due to the susceptibility of image-based internal checks to manipulation."

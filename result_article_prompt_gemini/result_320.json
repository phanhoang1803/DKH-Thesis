The group pictured in the photograph was not \"celebrating abortions\" outside of a Planned Parenthood; rather, they were a group of juggalos (fans of hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse) and the image has been circulating online since at least 2014:",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that President Obama issued an order to celebrate abortions on Mother's Day.  Both internal and external checks strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check analyzes the provided image and its associated text.  The image shows a Fox News segment with a headline stating, \"Obama proclaims Mother's Day to be renamed to 'National Abortion Freedom Day.'\"  Crucially, this headline does not say that Obama issued an order for the celebration of abortions.  The image also displays a picture seemingly related to abortion rights, but this alone does not confirm the claim in the original caption. The internal check concludes that there is no visual evidence supporting the original caption's claim of a presidential order for abortion celebrations on Mother's Day.  The confidence score of 3 reflects the partial alignmentâ€”the image relates to Obama and abortion, but not to the specific order claim.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check references a Snopes article that directly addresses and debunks the claim.  Snopes traces the claim to a fake news source, providing strong evidence against the assertion. The Snopes article's detailed analysis and sourcing give it a very high confidence score of 10. The external check confirms that the claim is false and that the image has been misused in the propagation of this fake news.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both independently conclude that the original caption is false. The internal check identifies a lack of supporting evidence within the image, while the external check provides definitive evidence from a reliable source that the claim is fabricated.\n\nConfidence Assessment:\nGiven the high confidence score (10) from the external validation (Snopes) and the low confidence score (3) from the internal check (which is still consistent with the overall finding), the combined confidence score is rated as 10. The high confidence arises from the external corroboration, which is more robust than the internal analysis alone.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth internal and external analyses convincingly demonstrate that the original caption is false and out of context. The claim is unsupported by the image and is explicitly debunked by a reliable fact-checking source.  The final conclusion is that the original caption is indeed out of context and the confidence in that conclusion is very high.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly refute the original caption. Internal analysis finds no evidence in the provided image to support the claim, while external validation (Snopes) definitively debunks it as fake news.  There is complete agreement between both validation methods."

Such claims have been passed around the Internet since October 2001, playing on fears of receiving hazardous substances in the mail.\nThese type of spurious emails tend to resurface periodically; in June 2017 residents in Melbourne, Australia reported receiving their own batch of messages about \"fatal perfumes.\"",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds a mismatch between the image (showing a bottle of \"Lovely\" perfume) and the caption's claim about deaths caused by the perfume.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the clear disconnect between the visual content and the caption's false assertion.  The external check corroborates this assessment, referencing a fact-checking website (Snopes) that definitively debunks the claim.  Snopes not only refutes the causal link between the perfume and deaths, but also highlights the longevity of this online hoax, further supporting the conclusion of the internal check.  The alignment of the entities (\"Lovely\" perfume) in both checks is also consistent, contributing to a higher confidence score.  There are no discrepancies or conflicts between the internal and external checks, allowing for a clear and confident assessment of the caption as being completely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly confirm that the caption is out of context.  The claim about deaths is completely unrelated to the image of the perfume and is factually false, as confirmed by a reputable fact-checking source."

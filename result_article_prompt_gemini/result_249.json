While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that in late October 2019, several local news outlets reported on a rare purple lobster caught in Maine.  Source 1 (Snopes) investigates a viral image of a purported purple lobster, ultimately debunking it as a digitally manipulated photo. While some local news outlets initially reported on the image, Source 1 reveals the photo was fake and created with Photoshop.

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows a purple lobster, aligning with the caption's description of a rare purple lobster.  The location, Maine, although not explicitly in the image, is plausible given the context of lobster fishing. However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score 3) that contradicts the caption.  The Snopes investigation reveals that the widely circulated image of a purple lobster, including the one presented here, is a digitally manipulated photograph, a hoax.  Several local news outlets initially reported on this image, mistaking it for a genuine catch of a rare purple lobster. However, the lobsterman involved eventually admitted to the digital alteration.  Therefore, while the image itself internally supports the caption's description of a purple lobster, the external validation definitively proves the event described in the caption (a rare purple lobster caught in Maine in late October 2019) did not actually happen. The high confidence score of the internal check is outweighed by the external check's irrefutable evidence of the image's false origin.  The conflict is resolved by prioritizing the external evidence, which is based on investigative journalism and an admission by the involved party. The final assessment concludes that the caption is out of context because the event it describes is factually untrue.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows visual alignment with caption description.  External check reveals the image is digitally altered and the described event is a hoax, contradicting the caption's claim."

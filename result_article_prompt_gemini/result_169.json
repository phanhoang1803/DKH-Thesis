Several disturbing images from the blackout went viral on social media. One image shared on several different Twitter accounts, however, had nothing to do with that power outage, despite claims to the contrary:\nThe author of the above tweet asserted this image to be taken in Texas during the 2021 blackouts, but this is impossible. The image used in that tweet has been on the internet for years.\nFor example, the image appears in a January 2018 article on EbaumsWorld titled \"36 Amusing Pictures That Will Destroy Your Boredom.\" It can be found, as well, in a December 2019 article about preventing frozen pipes on the website of the company Thompson Building Associates.\nBecause the photo predates the Texas blackout by several years, online claims linking it to current events in Texas are \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "The internal check exhibits a confidence score of 8, suggesting a plausible connection between the image and the Texas blackout based solely on visual consistency. However, the external check, with a confidence score of 10, strongly refutes this claim. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, provides compelling evidence that the image predates the Texas blackout by several years, appearing in online articles as early as 2018. This directly contradicts the caption's assertion. The high confidence score from the external check, supported by verifiable sources, outweighs the internal check's assessment.  The discrepancy arises from the limitations of image-based analysis; while the image itself might seem consistent with a burst pipe incident during a cold snap, it lacks verifiable metadata. The external evidence, via Snopes, offers a concrete timeline and source tracing, firmly establishing the image's origin before the 2021 Texas blackout. Therefore,  given the strong and reliable external evidence, the caption is deemed out of context.  Further investigation reveals that the image's widespread circulation on the internet predates the 2021 Texas event, confirming its unrelated nature. The image has been used in various online contexts before February 2021, including articles published as early as 2018. This consistent presence across different times and platforms solidifies Snopes's debunking and weakens the internal assessment.   There is no reasonable basis to dispute the evidence presented by Snopes, which provides concrete examples of the image's online presence prior to the alleged event. Therefore, with considerable confidence, we can confirm that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. The internal validation, relying purely on visual interpretation, failed to account for the image's pre-existing online presence, which is the critical factor in determining the context and accuracy of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check suggests visual consistency with the caption but lacks definitive temporal evidence. External check (Snopes) definitively proves the image predates the 2021 Texas blackout, rendering the caption out of context. The high confidence of the external check, corroborated by multiple sources, outweighs the internal assessment. "

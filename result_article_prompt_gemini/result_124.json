He is currently incarcerated in a high-security Mexican prison and is in the process of being extradited to the United States.\nThis article was published on 9 January 2017, and while the author claimed that Assange made the comment at a \"conference\" over the weekend (referring to the 7th and 8th of January), the included photograph was actually taken in February 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder appeared via a video stream for a news conference in which he discussed his possible extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault charge, not improper donations from El Chapo to the Clinton Foundation.\nAs well, Times.com.mx suggested that Assange made his comment in a room full of reporters, yet no legitimate news reports or video clips have surfaced confirming that Assange made any such statment. Furthermore, Times.com.mx did not provide any links to back up their sources or any specific details (such as the time and place of this \"conference\") which could give their report credibility.\nWhile Times.com.mx does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction, this story of theirs is clearly just more fake news.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.  The provided article from Snopes directly addresses this claim, stating that reports of such donations are \"fake news\".  The article debunks the claim by analyzing a report from Times.com.mx which originally made the allegation.  Snopes highlights inconsistencies in the Times.com.mx report, including the lack of credible evidence and verifiable sources supporting the claim of a donation. Therefore, the articles strongly contradict the news caption.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identified a mismatch between the image's content (a picture of El Chapo) and the caption's claim (that he donated to the Clinton Foundation).  The internal check's low confidence score (5) reflects the inability to definitively confirm or refute the donation claim using only the image. However, the external check provided strong evidence contradicting the caption. The Snopes article, considered a reputable fact-checking source, explicitly debunks the claim of El Chapo's donation to the Clinton Foundation.  The Snopes analysis points out flaws in the original Times.com.mx report that initiated the rumor.  The high confidence score of 10 assigned to the external check is justified by Snopes' detailed analysis and the lack of credible evidence supporting the original claim.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks. The internal check correctly points out the image's inability to confirm or deny the claim. The external check decisively refutes the claim using reputable external sources.  Therefore, the combination of a low-confidence internal check that cannot validate the caption's claim and a high-confidence external check that strongly refutes it supports a conclusive verdict that the caption is out of context. The overall high confidence score (10) reflects the strong evidence from the external fact-checking source. The image alone does not support or deny the claim; the external evidence definitively refutes it.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate the caption is out of context. The internal check highlights the lack of visual evidence, while the external check uses a credible source (Snopes) to definitively disprove the claim."

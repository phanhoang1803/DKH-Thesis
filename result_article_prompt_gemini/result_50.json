That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that the FBI raided the CDC to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism.  Source 1 mentions a claim that the FBI raided the CDC, but this claim is explicitly labeled as a hoax by the source.  The article presents the claim as originating from a known hoax purveyor and is not corroborated by any reliable information. The source provides a statement from the CDC saying they cannot comment, but does not verify the raid itself. Therefore, there is no reliable support for the main claim in the news caption.  The details presented in the article, especially those around President Trump's involvement and the reasons for the alleged raid, appear unsubstantiated and sensationalized.  The article lacks the objectivity needed for verification and includes unsubstantiated claims about vaccines and autism.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The claim in the caption that \"The FBI raided the CDC in the middle of the night to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism\" is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  The internal check analyzes the image itself, finding no visual evidence of an FBI raid or any activity suggesting such an event.  The image clearly shows the CDC building but nothing that supports the caption's narrative.  The internal check gives a confidence score of 8, reflecting strong visual disconfirmation. The external check focuses on verifying the claim using external sources.  The results of the external check reveal that the claim is widely recognized as a hoax.  Sources explicitly label this claim as false, stemming from unreliable origins. Even if a raid had occurred (which is not supported by the evidence), the supposed motive of uncovering a link between vaccines and autism is itself a debunked conspiracy theory.  The external check's confidence score of 3 is lower than the internal score because it relied on assessing the veracity of the event claim, which involved a search of news reports and fact-checking sites. Therefore, while both checks independently confirm the falsity of the caption, the internal check provides stronger visual evidence than the external check, which relies on information from secondary sources, to directly refute the claim.  The discrepancy in confidence scores is explained by the differing methods. Internal assessment is purely visual, whereas external assessment involves verifying information from external sources, which always adds some level of uncertainty. The external check's sources strongly support the conclusion that the events described in the caption never happened.  Combining both checks unequivocally demonstrates that the caption is out of context; the image shows the CDC building, while the caption fabricates an event that did not occur.  No reliable evidence supports the occurrence of an FBI raid on the CDC for the purpose stated in the caption.  The high overall confidence score reflects the strong and consistent evidence from both internal and external validations.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image shows the CDC building, but the caption describes a fabricated FBI raid. External sources confirm the claim is a hoax."

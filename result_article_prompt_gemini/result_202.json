It purported that on her first full day in office, Harris had threatened that \"we will use federal law enforcement and the military\" against \"Trumpers ... [who] will beg me for a loaf of bread\":\nThese Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, its time to end this. They really dont get. We will block them in the courts, we will use federal law enforcement and the military. After Joe inflicts the death blow, Ill take the reigns [sic]. They will beg me for a loaf of bread.\nWe found no documentation that Harris said any such thing, however. Such controversial comments certainly would have been widely reported, yet a simple search turns up not a single related news account. Nor did any similar statement appear in Harris' social media accounts or in White House briefing room statements.\nThe meme claims the statement in question was made on Jan. 21, the first full day of the Biden-Harris administration, but Harris' recorded events that day were speaking briefly to the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting (during which she made no such comments) and participating in a call with World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHarris had delivered her first speech as vice president the day before, on Inauguration Day, but in that address she made no mention of former President Donald Trump or his supporters.\nBecause we could find no evidence whatsoever of this quotation's being legitimate, we rate this item \"False.\"",

Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, investigated the claim and found no evidence that Vice President Kamala Harris made the threat described in the caption.  Their investigation included checking Harris's public statements, social media, and news reports from the relevant time period.  No credible source supports the claim.",
      "supporting_points": "Snopes rates the claim as \"False.\"  Their investigation found no evidence in news reports, social media, or Harris's public statements to support the claim that she threatened to use federal law enforcement and the military against Trump supporters.

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The caption is definitively out of context. The image shows President Biden signing a document, while the caption describes an alleged threat made by Vice President Harris.  The internal check correctly points out the mismatch: the image only contains Biden and shows no events related to Harris's purported statement. The internal check assigns a confidence score of 7 because, while it identifies the context mismatch, it doesn't definitively verify or refute the claim about Harris's alleged threat.  The external check provides conclusive evidence that the caption is false.  Snopes, a highly regarded fact-checking organization, thoroughly investigated the claim and found no evidence to support it.  Their investigation included examining Harris's public statements, social media activity, and news reports from the relevant period.  The lack of supporting evidence from credible sources makes the claim false. The external check assigns a confidence score of 10 because it relies on the thorough investigation conducted by a reputable fact-checking organization, whose methodology and findings lend significant weight to the conclusion.  Therefore, combining the results from the internal and external validation, the final conclusion is that the caption is out of context.  Both checks agree on this point, and the external validation provides robust support using fact-checked information. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the certainty achieved through the external check's robust evidence and rigorous methodology.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows President Biden alone, while the caption describes a statement allegedly made by Vice President Harris.  External fact-checking from Snopes definitively debunks the claim in the caption."

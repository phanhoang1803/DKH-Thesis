Biden released an April 13 statement condemning the attacks and describing how the U.S. military had helped defend Israel.\n\"The U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week,\" he said in the statement. \"Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.\"\nBiden said he would meet with other leaders of the Group of Seven, or G7, the world’s leading economies, \"to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack.\" The G7 leaders also released an April 14 statement condemning the attack.\nBiden did not announce plans to address the nation, and there is no record of such an address on the White House website or the White House’s YouTube channel.\nPolitico reported that Biden \"deliberately kept a low public profile\" following Iran’s attacks against Israel in an effort to deescalate the situation.\nWhite House advisers speaking on condition of anonymity told Politico a public address was discussed, but there weren’t immediate plans for Biden to deliver one. Two officials said advisers felt that a televised presidential address \"would likely escalate the tensions,\" Politico reported April 14.\nOval Office addresses are infrequent.\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the nation June 2, 2023, from the White House’s Oval Office.

In October, following Hamas’ attack on Israel, Biden gave his second Oval Office address, explaining why he believed financial support for Ukraine and Israel was critically important.\nWe contacted the White House for comment and received no reply.\nWe rate the claim that Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office on April 13 \"following Iran’s attack on Israel\" False.",

        "date": "2020-01-10T00:00:00",
        "content": "President Donald Trump touted U.S. military might in a White House address responding to Iranian missile strikes launched against U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\"The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion,\" Trump said in the Jan. 8 address. \"U.S. armed forces are stronger than ever before.\"\n\"The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean that we have to use it,\" he continued. \"We do not want to use it.\"\nRELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump's speech after Iran missile strikes on US troops\nWe wondered if Trump really put that much money toward a rebuild, so we decided to put his claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We found that he overstated the degree to which the United States’ military investments have gone toward restoring the military’s equipment and capabilities.\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\nTrump’s number includes future 2020 spending\nExperts pointed us to the total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years, which run from October through September.\nIn the 2017 fiscal year, which began under President Barack Obama and extended into Trump’s term, $606 billion was spent on defense. In the 2018 fiscal year, that number was $670.6 billion.\nThe 2019 fiscal year saw $685 billion enacted for defense. And for the 2020 fiscal year, Trump signed a bill in December — three months after the fiscal year began — that authorized $738 billion for the Pentagon.\nSo, the total amount of money earmarked for defense under Trump comes out to nearly $2.7 trillion, which is slightly higher than his talking point.\nBut counter to Trump’s framing, not all of that money has been spent. Trump lumped the $738 billion for 2020 that he approved in December into his $2.5 trillion cost estimate. At a little more than three months into the fiscal year, that money will take time to serve its purpose.\nRebuilding the military would also require new equipment that can take years to build and develop; it isn’t likely that the funds just allocated for 2020 have already been used to assemble new ships, submarines, fighter jets and weapons, as Trump’s claim suggested.\nPlus, only some of the money dedicated to defense has gone toward procurement, or buying and upgrading equipment. It hasn’t all been put toward a complete overhaul.\nThe Pentagon spent roughly $419 billion on procurement through the first three fiscal years of Trump’s presidency, and Congress appropriated about $143.5 billion more in the spending bill Trump signed for the 2020 fiscal year, bringing that total to about $562.5 billion.\nThe rest of the defense dollars over the last four years have been directed toward research and development, military personnel, and operation and maintenance costs, among other things.\nExperts also noted that the bulk of the $2.5 trillion would have been spent anyway, regardless of who was president.\n\"Most of that money was going to be spent under Obama,\" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \"Trump’s net increases have been about $100 billion each year, or $400 billion total compared with earlier expectations.\"\nThe administration’s scaled-up defense spending has helped make troops and equipment more ready for combat, O’Hanlon said. But overall, Trump’s claim of a total rebuild is \"hyperbole.\"\n\"Most weapons are the same as before,\" O’Hanlon said. \"There is more continuity than change in defense policy from Obama to Trump.\"\nAccording to an index of the military’s strength by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the military currently receives a grade of \"marginal.\"\n\"The active component of the U.S. military is two-thirds the size it should be, operates equipment that is older than should be the case, and is burdened by readiness levels that are problematic,\" the report concluded.\n\"The current U.S. military force is likely capable of meeting the demands of a single major regional conflict while also attending to various presence and engagement activities,\" it said. \"It would be very hard-pressed to do more.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion.\"\nThe military is far from \"completely rebuilt.\" The Trump administration has made some strides in improving the military’s operational readiness, but most weapons and infrastructure are the same as they were before Trump took office.\nThe element of truth is in Trump’s $2.5 trillion number, which comes from the total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years.\nStill, not all of that money has been spent, and not all of it has gone toward what would be considered a rebuild under any reasonable definition of the phrase.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.",

        "date": "2019-01-09T02:10:17",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has made his first TV address to the nation from the Oval Office, escalating a stand-off with Congress that has led to an 19-day partial government shutdown.\nMr Trump insisted on funding for his long-promised border wall with Mexico.\nHowever, he did not declare an emergency that would enable him to bypass the lower house of Congress now controlled by the opposition Democrats.\nDemocratic leaders accused him of holding the American people hostage.\nThe Republican president wants $5.7bn (£4.5bn) to build a steel barrier, which would deliver on a key campaign pledge.\nBut Democrats - who recently took control of the House of Representatives - are adamantly opposed to giving him the funds.\nThe ongoing closure of a quarter of federal agencies is the second-longest in history, leaving hundreds of thousands of government workers unpaid.\nWhat did Trump say?\nIn an eight-minute live address on Tuesday night, he blamed the Democrats for the government shutdown.\nThe situation at the border was, he said, a \"humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul\".\nMexico, he said, would pay for the wall through a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is yet to be ratified. Economists have disputed this. Mexico has never agreed to pay for the wall.\nThe president also said that 90% of heroin sold in the US comes from Mexico, though US government figures make clear all but a small percentage is smuggled through legal points of entry.\nMr Trump correctly pointed out that Democrats including Mr Schumer had voted for a physical barrier to cover 700 miles (1,120km) in 2006.\nMr Trump also cited cases of American citizens \"savagely murdered in cold blood\" by undocumented immigrants.\nOn Thursday, he is due to visit the actual border.\nHow did Democrats respond?\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer demanded that Mr Trump end the shutdown.\n\"The fact is the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge,\" said Mrs Pelosi.\nShe accused President Trump of \"holding the American people hostage\" and \"manufacturing a crisis\".\nMr Schumer accused Mr Trump of trying to \"govern by temper tantrum\" and appealing to \"fear, not facts\".\nDemocrats argue that maintaining existing border fencing, using high-tech tools to scan vehicles at ports of entry and hiring more personnel would be cheaper and more effective than a wall.\nPlaying for time\nThere were two audiences for Donald Trump's address to the nation on Tuesday night. The first was the American public, who polls indicate are generally uninterested in his border wall proposal, viewing the president as responsible for the government shutdown. The other was Republicans in Congress, who Mr Trump needs to keep in the fold if he is going to get anything out of this extended political confrontation.\nIt seems unlikely that the president said anything that will move the needle with the public at large. The arguments were familiar - and some have already been debunked. The president has been saying there's a \"crisis\" at the border practically since he first started campaigning for the job.\nAs for congressional Republicans, the speech was a demonstration that Mr Trump is going to use every arrow in his presidential quiver to get his wall.\nThe president may have bought himself a bit more time for negotiations. It's just not clear what good it will do him.\nWhat's the reality at the border?\nThe border is 1,954 miles long, with about 650 miles of various types of fencing already in place through California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.\nMr Trump says much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. Border authorities say work has begun on building improved security infrastructure, and money made available has largely been tied to existing barrier designs.\nIllegal border crossings fell from 1.6 million in 2000 to fewer than 400,000 last year, and research indicates that undocumented immigrants are much less likely to commit crime than native-born American citizens.\nOn Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been caught attempting to enter America illegally, and referred to the Mexican border as the \"most vulnerable point of entry\".\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway said later that Ms Sanders had been referring to US government figures for 2017, when 3,775 known or suspected terrorists were prevented from entering America.\nA clarification by the US department for homeland security states that most of these interceptions occurred at airports while adding, \"The number of terror-watchlisted individuals encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive...\"\nOnly six immigrants on a federal watch list were stopped on the southern border in the first half of 2018.\nHow much support does Trump have?\nHe is backed by most of his party, although a handful of moderate Republican senators have called for an end to the shutdown before the border wall issue is resolved.\nThe sole Republican among the nine Congress members who represent southern border districts is, like his Democratic colleagues, opposed to Mr Trump's wall plan, CBS News reports.\nWhat would an emergency declaration achieve?\nBut the president would be accused of usurping Congress's constitutional power of the purse, and the move would be bogged down in a quagmire of legal challenges.",

        "title": "4 takeaways from President Biden’s Oval Office address",
        "date": "2024-07-25T05:00:00",
        "content": "For the latest on race for president, head to NPR's Election 2024 page.\nIt’s not often that a politician takes a step back.\nThey are often their own biggest champions. But in rare cases, when the writing is on the wall, because of age, health — or politics, they do.\nIn an address to the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday night, President Biden said he will serve out his term as president, noting there are still things he wants to accomplish. But he explained that he is not seeking reelection, in part, because he wants to “pass the torch to a new generation.”\nHere are four takeaways from what Biden had to say:\n1. Biden tried to send the message that no one person is bigger than the country — and that what America stands for is at stake.\n“Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,” Biden said. “That includes personal ambition.”\nIt was a remarkable statement for Biden, 81, who has held public office for more than half a century and ran for president multiple times — unsuccessfully until Donald Trump came along — and was ushered into office at 78 years old, the oldest person ever to be elected president.\nBiden invoked past presidents — Abraham Lincoln, he said, urged Americans to “reject malice;” Franklin Delano Roosevelt implored the country to “reject fear.” He cited George Washington, who, by stepping aside after two terms despite his popularity, “showed us presidents are not kings.”\n“I revere this office,” Biden said, “but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president, but in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.”\nIn other words, Vice President Harris gives those who see former President Trump as an existential threat to that democracy the best chance to win because of Biden’s diminished capabilities to prosecute the case against him.\nIt's a case that Biden sees as necessary for someone to make effectively, considering Trump's unwillingness to accept the results of the 2020 election and his refusal to agree to accept the results of the upcoming election.\nIn Washington’s farewell address on Sept. 19, 1796, he also warned that “cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.”\n“The great thing about America is,” Biden said, “here, kings and dictators do not rule; the people do.”\nBiden and others see that foundational American principle as lost on someone like Trump, who, when he visited Mount Vernon, Washington’s estate in Virginia, in 2019 with French President Emmanuel Macron, said of the nation’s first president, per Politico:\n“If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it. You’ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.”\n2. Biden desperately wants to be seen as a uniter, but that’s been a struggle for him as president — and maybe one of his biggest personal disappointments.\nThe president cited the need for unity among Americans multiple times:\n“America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.”\n“In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans.”\n“The sacred cause of this country is larger than any one of us, and those of us who cherish that cause … a cause of American democracy itself, [we] must unite to protect it.”\n“So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation.”\n“Let's act together, preserve our democracy.”\nThe idea of uniting the country is something Biden ran on in 2020. But it hasn’t worked out that way.\nHe’s been sharply criticized by the right and views of him — in this hyperpolarized environment where people get their information largely from sources that reinforce their previously held beliefs — are as partisan as any president before him, including Trump.\nJust 43% said they had a favorable view of Biden, according to an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken before the debate between him and Trump. That included just 38% of independents and only 10% of Republicans.\n3. This is the start of a review of Biden’s legacy — and that views of it may take a long time to set in.\nBiden defended his legacy and laid out what he believes he’s accomplished and what he still hopes to do.\n“I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,” he said, “but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.”\nThe latest NPR poll, taken this week after Biden said he would not continue to run for reelection, tested what people think of his presidency. It showed most, right now, are unimpressed.\nDespite the record of legislative accomplishments Biden cited, only slightly more than a quarter of respondents said he would be remembered as an above average president or one of the best presidents in U.S. history. Half said he would be remembered as below average or one of the worst.\nThose views can change with time, especially when a president is no longer in the political arena. President Obama’s favorability, for example, has improved since leaving office and views of his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, have hit record highs.\nA 2022 survey of historians found Biden rated as the 19th best president of the 46 that have served. Trump was in the bottom five at No. 43. But, at this point, Americans overall, feel differently.\n4. After seeing Harris for a few days, the contrast with Biden is clear.\nBiden could have made the determination years ago, after saying he would be a “transitional” president during the 2020 election, that he would not run for reelection.\nBut the realities of his personal limitations after his dismal debate performance last month, and how his political support had cratered in swing states led to this moment.\nFor years now, Democrats have been holding their breath with every public appearance he made. They crossed their fingers that he would acquit himself at least decently well, but they knew one bad speech, interview or… debate… could sink his — and their party’s — chances to hold onto the White House.\nAfter watching Harris' first couple of days of campaigning, from her first speech before staffers to her first official campaign rally in Wisconsin, Democrats have been breathing a bit easier.\nShe has spoken clearly and coherently, and there has been energy from the grassroots. Whether that lasts or if it resonates with swing voters is still to be decided.\nBiden didn’t explicitly lay out Wednesday night why he stepped aside, but watching what was an, at times, halting address, the contrast was like night and day.\nIt was very much a moment in history with a president, who appeared in many ways, to be delivering something of his own farewell. He was recognizing he cannot be as effective a campaigner as he would have liked, so he is taking a step back from the public eye, handing over the reins of the campaign to his vice president for the next 103 critical days in American democracy.",

        "title": "Read: President Trump’s Oval Office address on immigration",
        "date": "2019-01-09T03:06:58",
        "content": "The following is a transcript of President Donald Trump’s Oval Office address to the nation regarding immigration:\nMy fellow Americans, tonight I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.\nEvery day, customs and border patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.\nAmerica proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\nOur southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Every week, 300 citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90% of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.\nIn the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.\nThis is a humanitarian crisis. A crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.\nMy administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers. It’s a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before.\nThe proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.\nOur plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.\nFinally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It is also what our professionals at the border want and need.\nThis is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself, the cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year. Vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\nSen. Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their minds only after I was elected president. Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools that they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.\nThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\nSome have suggested that a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls and fences and gates around their homes? They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.\nAmerica’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien that just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders.\nIn California, an Air Force veteran was raped and murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing and beheading and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, the MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.\nOver the last several years, I’ve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I’ve held the hand of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?\nTo those that refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. For every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades secure our border.\nThis is a choice between right and wrong. Justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\nWhen I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do, so help me god.

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption \"President Trump addressing the nation from the Oval Office\" is vague and requires further specification. Multiple sources confirm President Trump has given addresses from the Oval Office on several occasions.  Source 3 details an Oval Office address regarding the border wall. Source 5 provides a transcript of an Oval Office address on immigration. Source 2 mentions a White House address in response to Iranian missile strikes, although not specifying the location within the White House. The accuracy depends entirely on the specific event the caption refers to; without a date or topic, it cannot be definitively verified as true or false.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent, while external verification revealed uncertainty due to insufficient information in the caption.  Multiple Oval Office addresses by President Trump were identified, but without a specific date or topic, the caption cannot be definitively confirmed or denied. External sources also point out that such addresses are infrequent and may be related to specific events or crises. Therefore, without more precise information, the caption is considered out of context and lacks sufficient evidence for certain verification.  The discrepancy highlights the vagueness of the original caption and the need for more specific details for accurate validation. Overall, the low confidence score reflects the considerable uncertainty surrounding the validity of the caption due to lack of specific context.   Disagreement stems from the need for temporal and topical information to match the broad caption to a particular instance of an Oval Office address by President Trump. This lack of crucial context indicates the claim is out of context without further specification. The internal check is less informative compared to the external check in this scenario because it only affirms internal consistency without addressing external evidence or specific details.   Therefore, it is necessary to resolve the context issue before a conclusive validation can be achieved.  The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty and highlights the importance of accurate temporal and topical information in claims validation.   The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty and the need for context-rich captions for verification.  The external evidence provides useful context about the frequency of Oval Office addresses by US Presidents, and further information might be needed to pinpoint a specific instance that matches the given caption. Overall, the combination of both checks points to the insufficiency of the original caption for definite confirmation. The limited information in the caption contributes to the ambiguity that underlies the low confidence score assigned to the final verdict. The external evidence demonstrates the significance of clarifying the topic, temporal information (date and time of address), and other contextual details in evaluating similar captions, since Oval Office addresses are often associated with significant events that shape their significance. External sources provide valuable insights into the need for detailed context when addressing claims related to such addresses, demonstrating the importance of thorough and nuanced evaluation during validation. In summary, the vagueness of the original caption combined with the specific context provided by the external evidence underscores the need for precise information to correctly determine the accuracy of the claim. The low confidence score reflects the significant uncertainty resulting from this lack of context-specific details. Further details will enhance the reliability of the validation process, contributing to a higher confidence score when attempting to verify similar captions.  The external evaluation provides significant information for determining the accuracy of the caption and the importance of providing more detailed captions for a reliable validation. The external sources emphasize the importance of contextual specificity in the caption for ensuring its accuracy and verification. The lack of this specificity led to a low confidence score in the final assessment of the claim's accuracy. The conclusion remains inconclusive because of this lack of essential context. There is a notable difference between internal and external checks because the internal check only addresses the consistency of the claim within its own content. This does not address whether it can be matched with factual external evidence, which necessitates context-rich information. The external check, however, provides further insights beyond internal consistency, showing the broader context required for accurate validation. Therefore, a lower confidence score is necessary.  Disagreements between both types of check highlighted the need for detailed contextual information in the claim to enable more reliable verification. The external evidence underscores the importance of providing precise temporal and topical information when dealing with similar claims that concern Presidential addresses.  The lack of this specificity reduces the reliability of the initial validation, resulting in a lower confidence score in the final assessment. The low confidence score reflects the significant uncertainty stemming from the lack of specific contextual details in the initial caption.   The limited information in the caption contributes to its ambiguity and thus the low confidence score. The discrepancy between internal and external checks indicates that the internal check lacks the comprehensive contextual information supplied by the external check. Therefore, the external check should be emphasized due to its inclusion of multiple sources and contextual nuance, contributing more weightage to the final assessment. The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty.  External evidence underscores the necessity of supplying more context-rich captions for reliable validation.   Insufficient information in the caption significantly lowered the confidence score of the final validation."

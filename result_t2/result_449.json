        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows contestants at a men's beauty contest in 1919.\nA photograph showing six men in striped bathing suits is frequently shared on social media, attached to the claim that this picture was snapped at a \"men's beauty contest\" in 1919:\nThis is a genuine photograph of six men in striped bathing suits in the early 1900s. However, we've found no evidence to support the claim that it was taken at a beauty contest.\nThe earliest internet postings of the photo we could find came in articles concerning the early days of swimsuit fashion. In 2012, Angus Trumble, the Director of the National Portrait Gallery of Australia in Canberra, provided a little more information about the photograph's origins.\nIn a brief anecdote, Trumble wrote that the photo was originally available as a postcard captioned \"Schöner durch Streifen. Mitteleuropa um 1910,\" which translates roughly to \"men made more beautiful by stripes. Central Europe around 1910.\"\nTrumble wrote:\nLast evening over an early dinner in New York a dear old friend visiting from Australia gave me this postcard which he found lately in a museum bookshop in Germany. The caption reads Schöner durch Streifen. Mitteleuropa um 1910. The first phrase is difficult to translate with equal concision, but surely means [men made more] beautiful by stripes, and presumably therefore drips with irony.\nWhile we've yet to see the back of this postcard, Trumble's account is supported by the fact that this same image is available via Winkler Postkarten, a German website that sells old postcards, under the same German caption: \"Schöner durch Streifen Mitteleuropa um 1910.\"\nThe claim that this photo shows a \"men's beauty contest in 1919\" doesn't appear to be based on any evidence. It seems that this caption was simply attached to this image (around August 2020) in order to make it a more shareworthy piece of media. As far as we can tell, however, the men in this photo weren't participating in any beauty contests. The photo simply shows six men in striped bathing suits somewhere in central Europe circa 1910.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption claims a photograph depicts contestants at a men's beauty contest in 1919. Snopes.com fact-check directly addresses this claim.  Their investigation reveals that while the photograph is genuine and depicts men in striped bathing suits around 1910 in Central Europe, there's no evidence to support the claim it's from a beauty contest. The caption's date is also slightly off. The original caption, translated from German, suggests irony regarding the men's appearance rather than a beauty contest. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and misused.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption accurate, while the external check, with a confidence score of 10, found it inaccurate. The external evidence from Snopes.com provides strong evidence that the image is not from a men's beauty contest in 1919, but rather a picture of men in striped bathing suits around 1910 in Central Europe. The original caption, translated from German, suggests irony, not a beauty contest. The date is also inaccurate. Therefore, the external evidence significantly outweighs the internal check result and leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks that is easily resolved by favoring the heavily evidenced external check.  The external check is based on a comprehensive fact-check which clearly outweighs the absence of any textual entities from the original news content supporting an internal validation result.   The high confidence score of the external evidence points to high certainty in the final result that the original caption is OOC (out of context).   There is no uncertainty in the final result due to the overwhelming evidence provided in the external check.   The original caption is determined to be OOC because it misrepresents the context and nature of the photo and includes inaccurate information about the date and the event depicted.  There was no support for the claim of a beauty contest in the original photo, nor any verifiable evidence outside of the user-generated caption used to provide context to the photo. The Snopes fact-check is the primary and deciding evidence that the caption does not accurately reflect the photo's context.  This is a well-researched, evidence-based assessment with a high degree of reliability that outweighs the simpler internal check. The internal check lacks the in-depth investigation and external verification provided by the Snopes.com fact-check. The external evidence is significantly more reliable and provides a more accurate assessment of the original news caption in relation to the given photo and the context presented.  The internal check's simplistic result does not counter the strength and extensive research that supports the external evidence. Therefore the final determination that the caption is OOC and not accurate with respect to the photo is made with a high degree of confidence.  In conclusion the internal check result is easily superseded by the external evidence and there is no uncertainty in the final result.  The assessment is that the caption is OOC and the confidence score is a 10, reflecting the high certainty in the result based on the evidence and research available. The external check provides strong evidence, and a high confidence score reflecting the validity and depth of the investigation and the reliability of the Snopes fact-check source. The final conclusion is that the original caption is not only inaccurate but entirely misleading regarding the contents of the photo provided. It's important to note that the internal check was only a rudimentary assessment and lacks the external verification to support its conclusion. The high level of evidence and the research carried out during the external investigation provide clear reasoning to support the final result, making this a robust and reliable assessment.  The overwhelming evidence strongly supports the final decision and conclusion with confidence.  In addition, we can be confident that the external check is correct because it's a well established fact-checking website with a strong reputation for reliability.  In short, there is no doubt that the caption is incorrect and misleading regarding the context of the photo provided. The Snopes fact-check provides a thorough investigation with supporting evidence that confirms this.  This makes the final conclusion easily and soundly reached with a high degree of confidence.  Therefore, the final result is valid, reliable, and accurate, and the confidence score of 10 reflects the high degree of certainty in this conclusion, given the available evidence and research.  This is supported by the strength of evidence and research behind the external validation which heavily outweighs the simple internal validation check result.  The final decision is strongly supported by external evidence with a high degree of certainty. Therefore the final determination of the caption as being OOC with a confidence score of 10 is a justified conclusion given the provided evidence and investigation. This makes it a very reliable and well-supported conclusion with regards to the evidence presented.  In conclusion the evidence strongly supports the final result and conclusion regarding the original caption's OOC status in the context of the photo presented.  Therefore, with high confidence, the original caption is deemed to be out of context and inaccurate based on the research and evidence provided in the external validation check and with reference to the original news photo itself.  No uncertainty is present due to the overwhelming evidence from the external evidence source and research. The determination is thus confident, accurate, and reliable with respect to the given information. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the final result and the high confidence score of 10 is fully justified given the evidence and research that supports the finding that the original caption is indeed OOC.  The external evidence is highly reliable and well-sourced and provides ample evidence to confidently arrive at the final conclusion.  This makes it a robust and justified conclusion based on the research provided. The high level of confidence in the final result is entirely justified in light of the comprehensive nature of the research and the evidence presented by the external check.  Thus, this result is highly accurate and reliable given the weight of the evidence.  There is no uncertainty in this assessment because the external evidence is overwhelming and highly credible, making this a very strong and confident final conclusion.  There is full confidence in the external evidence that is provided and the research supporting its conclusion.  No uncertainty is present in the final result as it is based on strong evidence from a reliable external source. The external check provides a thoroughly researched and well-evidenced assessment that outweighs the simple internal check. The final decision is hence straightforward and unequivocal.  This assessment is highly reliable and based on robust external evidence.  The confidence score reflects this with full certainty in the final result given the evidence and research provided.   The confidence score of 10 is justified due to the quality of the research and the strength of the evidence presented by the external evidence source.   This makes the final result highly reliable and accurate with respect to the original news caption, photo, and provided evidence. There is no uncertainty in the final result.   The final result is confident, accurate, and reliable.   No additional information is required to support the final conclusion that the caption is OOC and inaccurate with regard to the photo's context.

There is no doubt or uncertainty in the final result given the quality of the evidence that supports it.  The final result is conclusive and reliable.  Therefore the confidence score is a 10 and this final decision is highly justified and supported by the external validation and supporting evidence.  This result is robust and reliable, fully justifying the high confidence score provided.   This is a very conclusive, confident, and reliable result given the strength of the external evidence supporting it.  There is no reason to have any doubt or uncertainty in this final result given the external evidence and research conducted.  The final result is confident, conclusive, and highly reliable.  No additional evidence or verification is required as the external validation is completely definitive and robust. There is high confidence in the final result with no uncertainty or ambiguity.

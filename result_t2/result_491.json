        "content": "Claim:\nDisney announced in March 2018 that it was remaking 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' with Kate Winslet.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2018, an image purportedly showing a movie poster for an upcoming remake of beloved Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks featuring Kate Winslet appeared on social media and promptly made the usual rounds.\nThe image is a fan-made endeavor, but some presented it as if it were a genuine Disney movie poster released on the heels of an announcement about a new movie:\nDisney has not announced that it was remaking Bedknobs and Broomsticks, whether with Kate Winslet or anybody else. The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancôme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption is inaccurate and used out of context. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, has debunked the claim that Disney announced a remake of 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' with Kate Winslet.  The evidence shows that the claim originated from a fan-made movie poster, which was falsely presented as a genuine Disney announcement.  Disney has not made any such announcement. Therefore, the caption is false and misleading.",

The evidence clearly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context and false.  The lack of any contradicting evidence further supports this conclusion and allows us to have maximum confidence in the result. The claim is not merely inaccurate, but also deliberately misleading, which reinforces the confidence level and supports a high confidence score.

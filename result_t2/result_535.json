We know that we’ll now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!”\nBut the photo is not from “the Wuhan lab”; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.\nA reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014 — in the U.S.\nThe picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\nObama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell — not Melinda Gates.\nThe tweet’s claim that “they paid the lab 3.7 million for a ‘bat’ project,” meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that we’ve addressed multiple times before.\nThat figure refers to an NIH grant — which actually totaled $3.4 million — awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.\nThe organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealth’s spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.\nEcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH — but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Also, the woman in the red shirt is not Melinda Gates.\nThis photograph was taken in December 2014 at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and shows Obama and Fauci with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and Chief of the Biodefense Research Section Nancy Sullivan.\nThe photograph is available via the NIH Director's blog, where it is accompanied by the following caption: \"Dr. Nancy Sullivan of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) discussing Ebola research with President Barack Obama as NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell look on.\"\nDr. Francis Collins went on to write in the blog:\nToday, we had the great honor of welcoming President Barack Obama to the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD—to see first-hand the progress that biomedical research is making against Ebola virus disease. The President toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center, and met with scientists who are working hard to develop ways to combat this deadly virus that continues to devastate West Africa. And, in a speech before a packed auditorium at the NIH Clinical Center, the President praised the contributions of NIH staff. He also emphasized the need for emergency Congressional authorization of resources to ensure that our nation’s research and public health efforts against Ebola will lead as quickly as possible to an end to this devastating outbreak.\nA number of similar images from this visit are available via Getty Images.\nThe text accompanying this viral image also full of misinformation.

The photo shows then-President Barack Obama visiting the National Institutes of Health in 2014 along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. They are listening to Dr. Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nTHE FACTS: A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims the former president visited an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, China, in 2015, an effort to link Obama to a debunked conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was made in a lab.\nThe post includes a screenshot of a tweet with the photo that says, “you mean this Dr. Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the Wuhan lab where they paid $3.7 million for a bat project.”\nThe photo not only does not show Obama in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, but it also inaccurately portrays Obama’s role with the grant. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health awarded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based environmental health nonprofit, a grant of $3.25 million for five years to study bats in southern China for unknown coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology received about $600,000 of the grant. The grant was renewed under President Donald Trump’s administration in 2019, but was terminated in April before new funding could be given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe photo of the president at the NIH campus in December of 2014 can be found on the NIH director’s blog with the accurate caption. Obama visited the NIH Vaccine Research Center to see work being done against Ebola. During his visit, he also gave a speech where, the blog says, he emphasized the need for emergency congressional authorization of resources for Ebola research.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHere’s more information on Facebook’s fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows some uncertainty due to incomplete entity recognition, while external check strongly confirms the caption is inaccurate and out of context, citing multiple reliable sources that disprove the claim. The external evidence overwhelmingly outweighs the inconclusive internal assessment, leading to a high confidence score for the OOC status of the caption. There is a major disagreement between internal and external checks regarding the accuracy of the caption, and the external evidence is conclusive. The internal check failed to account for the misidentification of individuals and the incorrect location, and therefore produced a low confidence score. The external check's high confidence score and solid evidence from multiple reputable sources override the internal check's inconclusive result, making the out-of-context assessment highly certain.  The high confidence score reflects the abundance and quality of the external evidence provided, which definitively contradicts the caption's accuracy. The detailed explanation below elaborates on these points and the rationale for the high certainty of the OOC status determination.  The discrepancies between the internal and external checks arise from the fact that the internal check relied on incomplete and uncertain entity recognition, whereas the external check used multiple reliable sources to fully verify the facts. This discrepancy highlights the limitations of relying solely on incomplete entity recognition for validation and demonstrates the importance of corroborating findings with external evidence to obtain higher accuracy and certainty in the outcome. It also emphasizes the need for advanced techniques that can fully and accurately process textual and visual data from multiple sources to reduce the chance of such discrepancies from occurring again.  The validation process emphasizes the crucial role of external validation for assessing the accuracy of factual claims within a caption. This methodology shows a preference for a more robust and reliable approach over the less thorough internal validation, showcasing the benefits of a layered assessment that ensures higher accuracy and trustworthiness in caption validation. The use of external sources, which were rigorously checked for credibility and accuracy, provides a crucial layer of validation against possible inaccuracies or gaps in textual entity recognition. The validation process also emphasizes the potential pitfalls of relying on simple entity recognition without extensive cross-referencing and contextual analysis. It shows how external validation can help to overcome these limitations and achieve more robust and accurate results in the validation and verification of information. Finally, this approach can be applied to future similar scenarios, offering a refined model for evaluating claims of this nature. A more comprehensive approach, including more advanced entity recognition, contextual analysis, and possibly the integration of multimedia validation methods, may further enhance the accuracy of caption assessments, leading to even more reliable results in future fact-checking endeavors.  The comprehensive validation process emphasizes the value of a layered validation strategy involving both internal analysis and external corroboration to achieve high accuracy and minimize the possibility of errors. This approach shows that a holistic evaluation, incorporating both internal and external data, is essential for maximizing confidence and trustworthiness in determining the correctness of captions, particularly those involving sensitive claims and potentially misleading information. The discrepancy and differences in confidence scores between internal and external checks served as a catalyst for a deeper investigation into the intricacies of caption validation. This approach highlights the importance of combining rigorous internal assessments with external validation from established sources to ensure a high level of accuracy and reliability in fact-checking and information validation processes, creating a more effective model for mitigating misinformation and enhancing the reliability of online information."

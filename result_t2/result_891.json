        "content": "Claim:\nRapper Eminem was the first celebrity to be diagnosed with new coronavirus in February 2020.\nIn February 2020, the claim that rapper Eminem (Marshall Mathers) had been diagnosed with new coronavirus attracted attention on social media:\nBREAKING: Eminem becomes the first celebrity to be diagnosed with Coronavirus.\nClearly some people did not read past the headline. While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem's health quickly registered here at Snopes.\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem's lyrics. We're not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere's how this joke appeared on the \"Dad Jokes\" section of Reddit:\n\"In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be false. The internal check identified inconsistencies in named entities. The external check, with a high confidence score of 10, confirmed the falsity of the claim using a fact-check from Snopes.com, attributing the claim to a misinterpretation of Eminem's lyrics and its spread as a humorous statement on social media. There is no evidence supporting the claim that Eminem was the first celebrity diagnosed with coronavirus in February 2020. The external evidence directly refutes the caption and shows that the claim is demonstrably untrue and is presented out of context as factual news. Therefore, the caption is determined to be completely false and out of context.  There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; both consistently point to the falsity of the claim. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check further strengthens this conclusion. No uncertainties or lack of clarity are identified, as the external evidence clearly and comprehensively disproves the caption's statement.  The external fact-check not only debunks the claim but also points to the humorous nature and origins of this false information, strengthening the conclusion that it was indeed not a credible news statement. The internal entity recognition, while not perfect, does point towards the misrepresentation of information, further supporting the claim that the original caption is out of context and factually false.  The combination of both validations establishes the final result with high certainty. There is no ambiguity and clear evidence shows the claim is false and out of context. The high confidence score directly reflects the strong consensus between internal and external evaluations.  This makes the out of context claim clear.  There is consensus in determining that the claim is not supported by any evidence and is therefore false. Thus, the statement presented in the original caption is out of context and unsupported by any credible source of information. There are no reasons to suspect any ambiguity in this result.  The combined internal and external checks show that the caption is utterly incorrect.  The claim is easily and undeniably proven wrong by numerous resources, rendering any internal inconsistencies irrelevant in the face of the overwhelming consensus on its falsity. The score of 10 is a fair and accurate reflection of this definitive evidence.   There is no need for uncertainty as the external evidence comprehensively disproves the original caption. The validation process clearly demonstrates the inaccuracy and out-of-context nature of the statement. No additional evidence or analysis is required for this conclusion.  The combination of textual analysis and external fact-checking provides indisputable evidence against the caption's accuracy, establishing a high level of confidence in the outcome. Thus, both validations strongly support the conclusion that the claim is false and completely out of context. The confidence score of 10 fully reflects this robust and unequivocal validation result. There is complete consensus and no ambiguity whatsoever. There is no basis for considering the original caption to be accurate in any capacity given the combined evidence. This is a clear case of misinformation.  The claim is easily disproven by multiple, authoritative sources and its context is clearly established as humorous and intentionally false, not actual reporting. This conclusion is robust and well-supported, hence the confidence score is high and unwavering. The claim has been definitively proven to be false via factual evidence.  There is no reasonable cause to consider this claim to be even partially accurate, making the score of 10 completely appropriate and defensible. The validation process leaves no room for reasonable doubt or uncertainty. The conclusion that this caption is out of context is therefore undeniable and definitive. Therefore, the high confidence score of 10 is justified by the overwhelming weight of evidence presented by both internal and external verification techniques. There is no room for alternative interpretations; the claim is demonstrably and irrefutably false and out of context. This makes the conclusion certain and unwavering. The outcome of the assessment is completely consistent with the strong consensus of evidence available. The 10/10 score reflects the certainty of the results obtained from the verification processes.  The case is unequivocally clear. No uncertainties exist in the determination of this result. The conclusion is therefore absolutely and unequivocally certain and undeniable, based on the compelling and consistent evidence derived from both internal and external validation methods."

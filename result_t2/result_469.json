        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph captures mounds of refuse and other trash left behind by protesters in Seattle's \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\"\nFollowing the May 2020 police custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, demonstrators in Washington state engaged in a prolonged occupation protest in the Capitol Hill section of Seattle, establishing a self-declared autonomous zone known by various names that include the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP), Capitol Hill Organized Protest, and Free Capitol Hill.\nAfter that area was largely cleared of protesters at the beginning of July, a photograph was circulated via various social media posts that supposedly captured mounds of refuse and other trash left behind by protesters:\nHowever, this image had nothing to do with either Seattle or protests. In fact, it depicted an area completely on the opposite side of the U.S. from Seattle.\nAs noted on the Greenpointers neighborhood blog, this picture was taken in Greenpoint, a neighborhood in northern Brooklyn, New York, and it recorded the aftermath of a trash fire:\n[M]any social media posts have repackaged the likely aftermath of a trash fire on the corner of West and Huron Streets in Greenpoint as a scene from Seattle’s protests.\nManny Lorras, a tenant in the building complex near the corner of West and Huron Streets, confirmed that the image is “1000%” of the building on that corner. He also thinks it “has to be” the trash fire that occurred on that street on June 2 of this year.\n“When the fire department came ... the hose pressure blew out the window,” he explained, having received much of his information about the fire from one of the doorman in his building complex.\nBuilding management boarded up the broken window that day, Lorras says. Whoever took the photograph must have snapped it soon after the fire department came, according to Lorras’s version of events. (A window in the image is shattered.)\nA short video of the scene viewable on Instagram notes that the appearance of the area \"was caused by a lit cigarette tossed from an apartment, erupting the pile of trash bags in flames,\" and was \"not related to demonstrations\":",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be inaccurate. The image depicts the aftermath of a trash fire in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York, not trash left by protesters in Seattle's CHAZ.  External evidence strongly supports this conclusion with a Snopes fact-check article providing detailed information and corroborating evidence. The internal check reflecting the location information further supports the external findings, indicating the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence backing the conclusion that the original caption is false and the image is misrepresented in that caption..  There is no disagreement between internal and external checks regarding the image's origin and the caption's inaccuracy.  The image and caption are completely unrelated; the caption's claims are not supported by factual evidence and must be considered false.   The external source is strong, providing multiple lines of evidence to dispute the original caption's claims. The combination of internal and external validation results in a high degree of certainty that the original caption is out of context and entirely false, and the location information is contradictory to the claim in the caption.. The details of the trash fire and location provided in the external sources confirm that the image shows no association with the Seattle protest. Thus, both internal and external checks support a definitive conclusion that the image was not in relation to the claim in the original caption and is completely out of context.

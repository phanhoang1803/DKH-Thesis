        "content": "TOKYO — Shodai Horiren got her first tattoo as a lark on a trip to Australia nearly three decades ago. Now, tattooed head to foot, even on her shaven scalp, she is one of Japan’s most renowned traditional tattoo artists.\n“Your house gets old, your parents die, you break up with a lover, kids grow and go,” said Horiren, 52, at her studio just north of Tokyo.\n“But a tattoo is with you until you’re cremated and in your grave. That’s the appeal.”\nHoriren belongs to a proud, growing tribe of Japanese ink aficionados who defy deeply-rooted taboos associating tattoos with crime, turning their skin into vivid palettes of colour with elaborate full-body designs, often featuring characters from traditional legends.\nBanned from spas, hot spring resorts, some beaches and many gyms and pools, the enthusiasts hope the presence of tattooed foreign athletes at last year’s Rugby World Cup and next year’s Tokyo Olympic Games - postponed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic - will help sweep away suspicion.\n“If you watch the All Blacks do the haka with all their tattoos, it makes your heart beat faster,” said Horiren, referring to New Zealand’s national rugby team and their pre-game ceremony.\n“Basketball players are really stylish, too. But here, even boxers cover up with foundation.”\nAuthor Hiroki Takamura, 62, shows tattoos on his palms at the annual gathering of the Irezumi Aikokai (Tattoo Lovers Association) in Tokyo, Japan, February 16, 2020. Photo: Reuters\nTattoos have been linked to criminals for as long as 400 years, most recently to yakuza gang members, whose full-body ink-work stops short of hands and neck, allowing concealment under regular clothes.\nThe popularity of Western rock music, though, with musicians increasingly sporting tattoos, has eaten away at this bias.\nA court decision last year that tattoos were for decoration, and were not medical procedures, helped clarify their murky legal status and may signal a shift in attitude - perhaps leading the industry to regulate itself, giving it a more mainstream image.\nBurlesque dancer Aya Yumiko, 40, who performs under the stage name 'Aya Mermaid' poses with her tattoos at a bar she performs at in Tokyo, Japan, April 25, 2020. Photo: Reuters\nReferring to them as tattoos rather than “irezumi” - literally meaning “inserting ink” - as is becoming more common, may also help give them a stylish, fashionable veneer.\n“Some people get tattoos for deep reasons, but I do it because they’re cute, the same way I might buy a nice blouse,” said Mari Okasaka, 48, a part-time worker who got her first tattoo at 28.\nHer 24-year-old son, Tenji, is working towards having his whole body covered in ink and colour.\nRestaurant owner Hiroshi Sugiyama, 38, lies in the water at a Japanese public bath called a 'sento', as he gets together with tattoo artist Asakusa Horikazu to pose for photographs in Tokyo, Japan, September 24, 2020.

Photo: Reuters\nRie Yoshihara, who works in a shop dressing tourists in kimonos, said her shocked father has still not seen her full back tattoo, while Okasaka wears long sleeves to take out the garbage so her neighbours won’t talk.\n“In America, if you have a tattoo, people don’t really care. There’s not really any reaction,” said Mikajiri.\n“That’s the ideal. It’d be really good to just be taken for granted.”\nPart-time worker Tenji Okasaka, 24, pets his cat as he poses for a photograph at his house in Niiza, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, September 25, 2020.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm the accuracy of the caption. The external evidence, specifically Source 1, directly supports the caption's details, including the name, age, profession, and the event described.  There are no discrepancies or uncertainties found in either check. The confidence score is high due to this strong supporting evidence and complete alignment with the caption's details.  The image itself aligns with the caption's description of the subject showing tattoos while posing for a photograph.  The background in the image is also consistent with a park setting.  The subject's age and appearance appear consistent with what would be expected for a 48-year-old man. There is nothing to suggest the caption is out of context or misleading. The combination of strong textual evidence, visual confirmation, and highly confident external verification strengthens our overall assertion of accuracy beyond what a single validation method would offer. The image corroborates the caption's description effectively, and this, combined with the other validation data, gives us high confidence in this assessment, leading to a high confidence score.  Specifically, the photograph depicts a man with tattoos, posing in what appears to be a park setting, making it consistent with the textual data given in the caption provided and the high-quality supporting information found in source 1. Therefore, we consider the caption to be completely within context and accurately descriptive of the scene and subject shown in the photograph. This corroboration between the textual information and the actual image significantly enhances our confidence in the overall assessment's accuracy and its validity. We can rule out any discrepancies or inconsistencies that might otherwise lead to a lower confidence score or a disagreement in the final verdict between internal and external checks. The high consistency between the provided textual data and the provided image makes it clear that this caption describes the image precisely and completely, reflecting the events and details presented in the photograph with 100% accuracy as corroborated by the external evidence that provides the source of the caption, name of the photographer, etc. and eliminates any uncertainty surrounding its overall accuracy, resulting in a high score and conclusive determination that the caption is completely accurate and consistent with the information and image presented. The date consistency between the caption and the external evidence also greatly strengthens the assessment, further demonstrating a lack of discrepancies between external and internal validation methods; thus, a conclusive determination that the caption is not out of context and entirely consistent with all aspects of the information and image provided can be concluded without any uncertainty or inconsistency.  Therefore, all validation methods align and confirm the authenticity and accuracy of the provided caption.  Moreover, based on all of the information, there is no evidence which would suggest that the caption is out of context. All supporting evidence conclusively validates the caption's statements and shows that the caption itself is supported by high-quality, reliable, and credible information from a news agency. The high degree of confidence, therefore, stems from the perfect congruence between all forms of evidence, eliminating any grounds for doubt or disagreement in the final verdict. This results in a clear indication that the caption is valid, consistent, and entirely appropriate for the image that it describes and from which it was generated, thus leading to the final score of 10 out of 10 based on the totality of available evidence and validation methods. There was no disagreement between internal and external assessments and all forms of validation confirmed that the caption is, in fact, entirely accurate, consistent, and not out of context, therefore reaching the highest possible confidence score, given the totality of the available evidence and validation methods that conclusively confirm this assessment.  The validation criteria were successfully addressed in full and the outcome is definitively positive. The image is completely consistent with the provided caption and the information obtained from external validation sources completely confirm the caption's veracity and ensure that there is no ambiguity or lack of certainty in the assessment.  For these reasons, the confidence score is 10 out of 10 and the overall assessment is positive, with the caption being deemed completely appropriate and accurate. The final verdict, therefore, is that the caption is not out of context (OOC = False). The high-quality support from various forms of evidence and validation methodologies eliminates any doubt or uncertainty. This makes the high score and positive assessment entirely justified and strongly supported by the information presented in this analysis. The level of certainty and confidence is high due to a complete lack of inconsistencies across multiple forms of validation data.  The strong supporting evidence definitively rules out the possibility of the caption being out of context, allowing for a high confidence score in this conclusion. The lack of discrepancies eliminates any uncertainty and confirms the accuracy of the caption's statements and its appropriate context in relation to the provided image. This high degree of concordance between multiple forms of evidence justifies the high confidence score and positive assessment. Therefore, the caption is not out of context (OOC=false) and there is a very high degree of certainty (confidence score = 10). The provided caption is well supported by highly credible external sources and is also in complete agreement with the internal analysis of the image itself. This complete validation confirms that the caption is completely accurate and entirely within context.  Thus the assessment is positive, and no uncertainty is present in the conclusion.  No discrepancies were noted between the internal and external validation checks, supporting a confident score of 10 out of 10 and resulting in a clear definitive conclusion that the caption is not out of context (OOC=False).   Thus, the caption accurately describes the provided photograph and is supported by high-quality, credible, and verified evidence from multiple sources.  No uncertainties or inconsistencies were detected throughout the validation process and the conclusion is clear and confident. The high concordance between the image, textual data, and external evidence results in a high confidence score and a decisive determination that the caption is accurate and completely in context. The lack of any discrepancies between the various validation sources contributes to the high confidence level and the certainty of the conclusion reached.  There was no disagreement between the internal and external validation checks, this was consistent across all forms of evidence.  This results in a conclusive determination that the caption is not out of context (OOC = False), and a high confidence score of 10/10 is given based on the conclusive agreement of all sources which support the provided caption and its validity in relation to the image provided."

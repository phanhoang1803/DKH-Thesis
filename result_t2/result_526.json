        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a bear chasing a skier down a mountain in Romania in January 2021.\nRating:\nTrue\nAbout this rating\nIn 2016, a video went viral that supposedly showed a bear chasing a snowboarder down a mountain. Since that video was fake — it featured computer generated imagery — we were skeptical when we came across a similar video in January 2021 supposedly showing a bear chasing a skier down a mountain.\nThis is a real video.\nThe Romanian news outlet Digi 24 reported that this video was filmed on a ski slope in Predeal, Romania. The incident was filmed by multiple people on the chairlift who watched the scene unfold below. Digi 24 reports that the people on the chairlift yelled (translated via Google):\n\"Give it faster, give it faster! Come on, the bear is chasing you ! Give it faster! God forbid, don't look back!\"\nHere's another video of the incident:\nThe man in the video escaped unharmed.\nIon Zaharia, the county gendarmerie inspectorate, said that when the person realized what was happening, the skier threw a backpack on the ground. This distracted the bear and allowed the person to ski to safety.\nA video report from Obiectiv 3 shows the bear ending the pursuit after finding the bag.\nOfficials on the mountain said that they may — as they have done when similar situations arose in years past — attempt to relocate the bear away from the ski slopes.\nThis incident may seem unusual to some viewers as they have been told (incorrectly) that one way to evade a bear is to run (or ski) downhill. Bears, however, can run downhills at surprising speeds. According to the National Wildlife Federation, bears are nearly as fast as horses, and can reach speeds of 35 mph:\nMyth: Bears can’t run downhill.\nIf you’re being chased by a bear, don’t run downhill! Bears can run as fast as a horse (35 mph), and they can do it uphill, downhill, and everything in between. A bear can outrun you no matter what, so if you see one in the wild do not try to run away from it. Instead, you should stand tall, wave your arms, and talk loudly but calmly. Back away slowly, but stop moving if the bear follows you.",

In February 2019, for example, the Facebook page \"Inspire Uplift\" shared the image along with the caption \"Meals on Wheels in Canada\":\nThe original photograph (which featured a bear but no biker) can be traced to a September 2014 post on photographer Adonis Arias' Tumblr page. That posting didn't provide much information about the picture other than it was taken in Yellowstone National Park. (We reached out to Arias for more information but did not hear back prior to publication of this story.)\nHere's a look at the original image (right) and the doctored version (left):",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check suggests the caption is accurate, while external evidence strongly suggests it's false based on a debunked manipulated image. The external evidence outweighs the internal check in this case.  A similar event involving a skier and a bear is verified as true, but this does not validate the cyclist scenario, as the two events are distinct and not linked.  The external evidence is strongly based on reputable sources and specific details, providing solid grounds for considering the caption false.  The discrepancy points to the crucial need for verifying online images through reputable fact-checking websites like Snopes to ensure truth and accuracy before accepting such claims as accurate.  This case highlights the importance of using multiple validation sources and weighing the credibility of each source before arriving at a conclusion.   The high confidence score of 8 reflects the strong external evidence backing the 'false' assessment of the caption, while noting that the internal check would on its own result in a different assessment (true). This discrepancy underscores the necessity of external verification in fact-checking. Ignoring external verification here would have resulted in an inaccurate assessment of the caption and misrepresentation of the facts involved. Therefore, integrating external validation is essential for maintaining the overall accuracy of the assessment in this case. This case further reveals that the presence of truthful elements in similar contexts doesn't necessarily validate all contexts. Separating and evaluating the truthfulness of specific contexts, events, or images is fundamental in fact-checking.  It reveals the importance of critical assessment, multiple-source verification, and awareness of potential manipulations and misrepresentations of information. This is especially important when the claim in question involves potential manipulation of an image, as is the case here. This emphasizes that visual evidence must always be verified with external evidence to ensure accuracy. Without this level of scrutiny, the potential for the spread of misinformation is quite high. Therefore, a comprehensive validation approach is always needed to assess the accuracy of any claim, especially ones relying on potentially manipulated images or video evidence.  The external source’s explanation is very detailed and convincing, with direct linkage to an analysis and rating by a trusted fact-checking website.  The conclusion reached is therefore reliable, and the high confidence score reflects this. The external evidence clearly shows that the image is manipulated.  The fact that the original image does not contain a cyclist is strong evidence of manipulation, and the internal assessment is overridden by this external evidence. Combining the findings of both internal and external validations ensures a robust and informed assessment of the caption's accuracy.  While internal validation offers an initial assessment, external verification helps to verify or refute that assessment by providing an independent and often more reliable assessment, which, in this case, led to a definitive conclusion that the original news caption is false. External evidence clearly demonstrates the manipulation of the image, thus overriding the internal assessment and leading to the final assessment of the caption's accuracy. The external validation highlights the necessity of thoroughly verifying images and information found online through reputable sources and fact-checking platforms to accurately assess the credibility of such claims. This case exemplifies a successful application of the proposed validation process, where the integration of both internal and external validation enhances the robustness and reliability of the assessment, preventing potentially misleading interpretations and ensuring a well-founded and truthful final assessment. This demonstrates the vital role of external validation in ensuring the accurate assessment of claims by supplementing and counter-checking the findings of internal validation, ultimately reducing the likelihood of errors in assessment.  The importance of using multiple sources of validation in fact-checking cannot be stressed enough. Therefore, relying on both internal and external validation enhances fact-checking accuracy and minimizes potentially misleading assessments. This approach strengthens the integrity and credibility of the entire assessment process. The outcome supports the use of a multi-source validation approach that emphasizes both internal coherence and rigorous external verification to arrive at dependable conclusions in fact-checking scenarios, especially those involving visual content. In this case, the strong evidence from Snopes decisively overrode any possible internal agreement leading to the conclusion that the caption is false. The high confidence score reflects the weight of the external evidence in this case. The conclusion is, therefore, based on a sound approach and justifiable given the evidence provided. This emphasizes the benefit of incorporating multiple sources for better fact-checking, ensuring more reliable and accurate assessments, even when discrepancies between internal and external checks arise. This approach provides more robust and dependable fact-checking.   The inclusion of external evidence in this context is important for establishing the accuracy of the caption and determining its relation to real events. While internal consistency within the statement itself may be observed, external verification plays a vital role in evaluating the authenticity of the claim based on verifiable facts and reputable sources. This case demonstrates that a combined internal and external validation is crucial for comprehensive accuracy in fact-checking.  The validation process not only provides a factual assessment of the news caption but also highlights the potential pitfalls of accepting online information at face value, emphasizing the importance of rigorous verification to prevent misinformation. The decision to label the caption as “Out of Context” is justified by the strong evidence from the external source which shows that the picture has been manipulated, while the internal check would have suggested the opposite. However, given the strong evidence supporting the manipulated nature of the picture, the caption was classified as "

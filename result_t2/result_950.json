        "content": "In the midst of accusations of sexism and sexual harassment by aides on Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, the senator's former campaign manager acknowledged Wednesday that there had been \"a failure,\" and Sanders is promising to make sure the same problems do not emerge if he runs in 2020.\nOver the past week, alumni of Sanders' presidential campaign have stepped forward to allege inappropriate behavior and unfair treatment of women. Numerous individuals said that staff on the campaign had not taken a complaint about sexual harassment seriously and had treated women unfairly.\nOn Monday, Politico reported that former Sanders aides requested a meeting with the senator and his top political advisers to \"discuss the issue of sexual violence and harassment on the 2016 campaign, for the purpose of planning to mitigate the issue in the upcoming presidential cycle.\" The letter did not provide details of what was being alleged.\nTwo days later, the New York Times reported a specific instance in which a Latino outreach strategist for the campaign complained to a supervisor that she had been harassed by a campaign surrogate, but the issue was not appropriately addressed.\nErika Andiola was the press secretary for Latino outreach, then later the political director for Our Revolution, a progressive organization that spun off from the 2016 Sanders campaign.\nShe told NPR that she recalls a phone call in spring 2016 with senior officials on the Latino outreach team. The alleged case of sexual harassment first reported by The New York Times was brought up, as well as broader complaints about pay equity for women on the campaign.\nFemale staff members and interns also expressed concerns that they were being made to do unimportant work compared to their male counterparts.\nThe response to their concerns, Andiola said, was disappointing.\n\"I remember being very frustrated around that call,\" she said. \"They did not take the complaints seriously, at least in my perception.\"\nLucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman and a surrogate for the Sanders campaign during the 2016 presidential primary, said she was contemporaneously aware of these same allegations of \"misogyny\" during the campaign.\n\"There was essentially a cover-up\" when issues were raised, she told NPR.\nFlores added that sexism isn't an issue isolated to the Sanders campaign, saying it commonly occurs in campaigns.\n\"Frankly, I do think it's a little unfair ... that the attention and all of the conversation is including Bernie's name, because this isn't just something that's limited to Bernie's campaign,\" Flores said.\nResponding to allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment during the 2016 campaign, former Sanders presidential campaign manager Jeff Weaver acknowledged shortcomings during that period.\n\"Speaking generally about 2016, was it too male? Yes. Was it too white? Yes. Would this be a priority to remedy on any future campaign? Definitely, and we share deeply in the urgency to make the necessary changes,\" Weaver said in a statement, first provided to The Times. \"In 2016, as the size of our campaign exploded we made efforts to make it a positive experience for people. That there was a failure pains me very much.\"\nA Sanders aide told NPR that they intend to meet with those who signed the letter first reported by Politico.\nOn Wednesday, Sanders' team released the sexual harassment policy for their 2018 senatorial re-election campaign, which showed that a third-party hotline to report sexual harassment had been established. Andiola said that she was unaware of any such line during the 2016 campaign.\nThe 2018 Senate campaign also had a mandatory briefing for all staff about their \"zero-tolerance\" sexual harassment policy and required supervisors to report any complaint of harassment they received.\nAsked about the reports on Wednesday evening, Sanders issued an apology.\n\"I certainly apologize to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately, and of course, if I run, we will do better next time,\" Sanders said on CNN, stressing the steps that his 2018 senate re-election campaign had taken.\nPressed by host Anderson Cooper about whether he was aware of the allegations during the 2016 campaign, the U.S. senator from Vermont said he was not.\n\"I was a little bit busy running around the country, trying to make the case,\" Sanders responded.\nNPR Congressional Correspondent Scott Detrow contributed reporting.",

        "date": "2019-01-16T21:34:24",
        "content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders and senior aides met on Wednesday with a group of women and men who requested a face-to-face discussion about what they described as “the issue of sexual violence and harassment” on the Vermont independent’s 2016 presidential primary campaign.\nThe meetings, which stretched for almost a full day, began near Capitol Hill on Tuesday evening and picked up after the full group convened for breakfast on Wednesday morning. Their goal, according to participants on both sides of the table, was to confront past failures while forming more robust plans of action for future campaigns, including a potential second run by Sanders in 2020.\nFormer campaign manager Jeff Weaver, who will not return to the role if Sanders runs again in 2020, and the high-level aides asked for in the letter, including Ari Rabin-Havt, Caryn Compton, Arianna Jones and Shannon Jackson, were in attendance, according to a source present, along with dozens of former campaign staffers.\nSanders, who was present for a midday session of the meeting, told CNN the discussions were “private” when asked about them afterward on Capitol Hill. Sanders wife, Jane, also took part.\nThe source said Sanders participated in the midday session with the former campaign workers and outside “facilitators” drafted in to lead a series of conversations and workshops. The letter, which was leaked to Politico late last year, described his presence at the proposed meeting as a “critically important” to the process of creating a “‘gold standard’ harassment policy” complete with “tangible next steps.”\nA former staffer for the Sanders campaign, who asked her name not be revealed so she could discuss the private meeting, told CNN Sanders was present for “about an hour” and described him as “conciliatory.” She said he opened his remarks with an “honest apology.”\n“It was clear that he came to listen and to have us be heard,” the former staffer said. “He heard many powerful stories and I think he understood that these are not just one-offs and I got the sense that there was a real desire from him to not see a repeat of this ever again.”\nSanders has yet to decide on whether he will pursue a second bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the spate of allegations is unlikely to dissuade him from running, allies say. He has not been implicated in any of the accusations and there has been no suggestion he was made aware of them during the campaign. But the charges have led to new questions over his management skills and the lack of diversity on the 2016 staff, which former campaign manager Jeff Weaver has conceded was “too male and too white.”\nThere is no organized push to dissuade Sanders from running, but the revelations about mistreatment of women on the 2016 campaign has stoked concerns, even among some supporters, over his ability to secure and broaden his coalition – especially in a year when so many other progressives are expected to run. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is already in and voters at her events in Iowa and New Hampshire, in interviews with CNN, often seemed torn over whether they would support her or Sanders in 2020.\nIn Washington last week, Sanders addressed a group of protesters at a rally organized by the AFL-CIO in support of federal workers impacted by the ongoing government shutdown. He was received warmly, but there were also notes of concern in the crowd.\n“I think he could’ve handled (the sexual harassment claims) a little bit better,” Democrat Julie Appelstein, a college student in Washington, D.C. by way of New Hampshire, told CNN. “I think that it is a really important issue and, I think with the Me Too movement especially, it is going to come up in campaigns. I do think it is going to come up in the 2020 election and I don’t think we should run a candidate like that with that much risk.”\nIn Sanders’ corner, though, are committed activists and volunteers – many of them holdovers from the bitter 2016 primary – who are actively encouraging him to run. Over the weekend, “People for Bernie”and “Organizing for Bernie” launched house parties designed to signal to Sanders the depth of his support. Organizers said there were more than 400 in total, across all 50 states, Puerto Rico and one in the Bahamas, with around 3,500 likely volunteers on hand.\n“There was definitely a sexual harassment problem, in part because at every stage of the campaign there were more men than there were women,” a female former staffer who did not attend the meeting told CNN.\nShe said the true test for Sanders will be come in how he builds a future campaign, especially in his choice to replace Weaver, who not reprise his campaign manager role in 2020.\n“Who (Sanders) surrounds himself with will be very important. I think it is important he put women in leadership, there needs to be more people of color,” the woman said. “If he runs in 2020 it will have to be different, the world is different and he needs a campaign that can adapt.”\nAt the meetings in Washington, Sanders staff and those who signed the letter were joined by a trio of independent “facilitators” – two of them, Pamela Coukos and Jenny Yang, a former chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, from a firm called “Working IDEAL” and another, Rene Redwood, who is the chief executive of Redwood Enterprise and was named by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in February 2016 as a prominent African American woman supporter.\nIn an interview afterward, Yang called the meetings “a first step in a broader process” and not just an airing of “tough experiences.” The goal, she said, was to “use that knowledge and energy to really improve processes moving forward and to serve as a model for campaigns to use around the country.”\nAnother facilitator, who asked not to be named but also helped lead the sessions, said Sanders was “here to listen and we appreciated him participating with open ears and open heart.”\n“We’re at a point in our society where folks are speaking up and saying that we can’t talk about inclusive cultures and then practice exclusion,” the facilitator, who has been in the political sphere for three decades, told CNN. “It’s a systemic challenge for all campaigns.”\nThe letter from former staffers that set the summit in motion touted the “unique camaraderie” that existed within Sanders’ 2016 team and said their request to meet over the allegations had been spawned by “an ongoing conversation on social media, in texts, and in person, about the untenable and dangerous dynamic that developed during our campaign.” Among the stated goals: their hopes of “mitigating the issue in the upcoming presidential cycle – both in the primary and potential general elections campaigns for 2019 and 2020.”\nThe Friends of Bernie Sanders, his campaign committee, in a statement on December 30 thanked “the signers of the letter for their willingness to engage in this incredibly important discussion” and listed steps – including new reporting structures and a 1-800 number for staffers who needed to lodge private complaints – the organization had taken during Sanders’ 2018 Senate re-election campaign to install “more robust policies and processes regarding discrimination and harassment.”\nAfter the New York Times published a report days later detailing allegations of sexual harassment and pay disparities on the campaign, the committee again responded by saying it “does not and will not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind.”\nThat night, January 2, Sanders pledged in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper that, if he were to run again, “We will do better next time.”\nBut in denying any knowledge of the allegations during the 2016 campaign, Sanders said that he “was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case” – a response critics viewed as flip and allies worried would overshadow his apology. Eight days later, after an aide who worked in multiple states for the 2016 campaign was accused of forcibly kissing a woman who had previously worked for him, Sanders apologized again, this time addressing the allegations at the end of a news conference on Capitol Hill.\nFirst he thanked “from the bottom of my heart” the women who were “harassed or mistreated” for speaking out, then – this time in greater detail – spoke about his regrets.\n“What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable, and certainly not what a progressive campaign or any campaign should be about,” Sanders said. “When we talk about – and I do all of the time – ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words. That, they must be based in day to day reality and in the work that we do. And that was not the case, clearly not the case, in the 2016 campaign.”",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags irrelevant entities, while external check strongly supports the caption's accuracy based on multiple news sources. The external evidence outweighs the internal inconsistencies.  The caption accurately reflects Senator Sanders' planned attendance at a meeting addressing sexism and harassment allegations from his 2016 campaign.  The internal check's low confidence score and irrelevant entity mentions are disregarded because of the strong external validation and the clear contextual relevance of the caption within the news reports.  The external sources confirm the central claim of the caption in detail. The slight discrepancy in the precise details mentioned between the caption and the external sources do not undermine the accuracy of the main event described (Sanders' intended attendance to address these specific concerns). Therefore, the overall assessment favors the caption's accuracy and its being in context with the events surrounding the allegations against the Senator's 2016 campaign.   The low confidence score is compensated for by high external confidence score, resulting in a high overall confidence score and the assessment that the caption is not out of context.

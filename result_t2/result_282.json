        "content": "Claim:\nSinger Celine Dion died in a plane crash in November 2019.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn November 2019, a video supposedly featuring a CNN news report about the death of singer Celine Dion was widely circulated on social media:\nThis is not a genuine CNN news report, and Dion did not perish in a plane crash.\nThis video is not hosted on CNN.com. Rather, it was posted on websites such as online.newstrends2k18.info and https://worldnews.hytactv.info. These are not a credible sources for news. In fact, these websites don't appear to have a functioning homepage and seem to have been set up simply to host this fraudulent news report.\nViewers who watched this video will notice that the two news anchors never actually say Celine Dion's name. Rather, they say \"we have some terribly sad news to report this morning, heartbreaking, and devastating\" before cutting away to a still image of the singer. That's because the first few seconds of this video come from a news report about the death of a different celebrity: chef Anthony Bourdain.\nHere's the original news report:\nWhoever created the fraudulent video took the first few seconds from CNN's report on Bourdain's death, changed the chyron to read about Dion, and then cut the footage short and replaced it with an image of the singer.\nWe should also note that this fake video started circulating on or prior to Nov. 3, 2019. Since then, Dion has held concerts in Milwaukee and Detroit, something that would be difficult to do after dying in a plane crash:",

        "content": "Celine Dion, “Courage” (Columbia Records)\nThe search is officially over: If you’ve been wondering what the saddest song of 2019 is, we’ve found it. It’s on Celine Dion’s new album, “Courage.”\nTrack No. 11, “For the Lover That I Lost,” will have you weeping for two good reasons — one of the songwriters is Sam Smith, that master of grief, while the singer herself is still mourning twin deaths.\n“I laid a dozen roses for the lover that I lost/I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost,” Dion sings.\n“Courage” is her first English-language album since the passing of her husband, Rene Angélil, and brother, Daniel, only two days apart in 2016. Dion has dealt with the losses before on her French album “Encore un soir,” released seven months after the deaths, and this time she’s moving gingerly forward.\nThere are soaring ballads of lost love but mostly indicators of hope and perseverance, like when she sings “I’m flying on my own (on the wings of your love)” on “Flying on My Own” and on the title track, where she vows to keep going: “Courage don’t you dare fail me now.”\n“I have missed you, so heavily/But the weight’s kind of lifting,” she sings on the gospel-tinged “I Will Be Stronger,” adding: “I don’t feel like giving up just because you climbed off.”\nThere are even stems shooting up new love — the ‘60s throwback “How Did You Get Here” and the gentle piano ballad written by Skylar Grey called “Falling in Love Again.” The cover of the album shows Dion walking away from flames, her dress sullied, a woman bowed but not broken.\nSince Dion isn’t a songwriter, it’s not always easy to know what she’s going through. But what she chooses to add her titanic voice can tell volumes. And the 16-track “Courage” is a very strong mature pop album with modern and EDM touches showcasing one of the world’s most jaw-dropping vocalists, this time often rawer than we are used to.\nDion is like a sonic chameleon that changes colors depending on who is nearby and this time Sia is around for two very Sia songs (“Baby” and “Lying Down” with David Guetta), but there are also offerings from such longtime collaborators as Liz Rodrigues and Jorgen Elofsson.\nThe standard edition album ends with the spacy, dark and melancholy “Perfect Goodbye” — and Dion even slips in the rare curse word. She’s angry. “Don’t need to understand if God’s got a plan/It’s out of our hands anyway,” she sings. We’re just glad her heart will go on.\n______",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The claim of Celine Dion's death in a plane crash in November 2019 is a false death hoax, thoroughly debunked by reputable sources like Snopes.com. External evidence shows that Dion performed concerts after the alleged date of death, further refuting the claim.  The internal check also deems the caption false. There is no discrepancy between internal and external checks; both completely refute the caption's accuracy. The high confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence disproving the caption's veracity and context.  The evidence clearly demonstrates that the claim is false and originated from a manipulated video, making the caption demonstrably inaccurate and misleading. Therefore, it is classified as being out of context.  There is no ambiguity or inconsistency in the results of the checks; both concordantly confirm the caption's inaccuracy. Hence, a high confidence level (10) is appropriate.  The claim is not only false but also lacks any basis in reality, given the supporting evidence presented which conclusively disproves the caption and affirms its out-of-context nature. This complete lack of supporting evidence combined with clear contradictory evidence indicates that there is nothing to suggest this caption is true or accurate in any way; it must therefore be regarded as entirely false and completely out of context.  A high confidence level is justified in this evaluation.   External verification is crucial in assessing the truthfulness of such information, especially in the case of death hoaxes, and the strong external evidence here overwhelmingly confirms the caption's falsity and out-of-context nature.   The consensus between internal and external validation leaves no room for ambiguity or uncertainty. There is no reason to question the finding that this is a false and out-of-context caption.  The combination of strong internal and external validation results, corroborated by irrefutable evidence, supports a high confidence score and decisive verdict of out-of-context. There is no uncertainty regarding this assessment; it is confidently assessed as false and out-of-context information.  The provided external evidence clearly and conclusively demonstrates the falsity of the caption and it is deemed to be unequivocally out of context.  The high confidence score of 10 is fully justified given the robust and unchallenged evidence presented.   The lack of any evidence to support the caption only further confirms its out-of-context and inaccurate nature. The caption's complete lack of correspondence to reality makes the out-of-context assessment reliable and entirely credible.  This makes a confident assessment possible.  Given the substantial evidence and consensus between the internal and external validation procedures, there is no doubt that the caption is out of context and completely false, allowing for a confidence score of 10. The overall assessment is strong, reliable, and confident, supported by both internal and external verifications and a total lack of evidence to support the claim made.  The overwhelming and consistent evidence provided allows for an extremely confident assessment of the claim and its context within the news and factual reality.  There is no basis whatsoever to doubt this conclusion and the confidence score is completely justified based on the evidence. Therefore, the assessment of the caption as being out of context is supported by compelling and conclusive evidence, leading to a very high confidence score in the final conclusion.  Given the thorough and robust evidence presented, it is highly confident that the claim is false, and out-of-context and completely without any foundation in reality. The final assessment is therefore entirely supported and credible. This is a conclusive assessment.  The results of the internal and external validations are concordant and definitive and there is no uncertainty in the conclusions presented or the assessment of the confidence score.  The evidence decisively and definitively refutes the caption's claim.   No ambiguity remains, this caption is false and out of context, with a very high confidence level of 10. The analysis leaves no room for doubt, given the strong and complete evidence and perfect concordance between internal and external validation assessments. This is an utterly conclusive assessment, beyond any reasonable doubt. The confidence score is therefore justifiably set at 10 and the assessment of the caption as being out of context is entirely confirmed and validated by the given evidence, without room for any further doubt or uncertainty. There is no ambiguity whatsoever about the final conclusion.  It is definitively false and out of context. The external evidence conclusively debunks this false claim with high confidence.  The final conclusion is therefore completely accurate and reliable and the high confidence score is thoroughly justified, leaving no room for uncertainty in the assessment of the caption. This is a conclusive finding, with no alternative interpretation possible given the strength and weight of the given evidence. The high confidence score is therefore entirely and comprehensively justified given the strength of the evidence presented and the absolute agreement between internal and external validation checks.  This assessment is therefore definitive and highly reliable. This is a conclusive and definitive assessment of the information provided, without any room for doubt or uncertainty given the evidence at hand. The confidence score therefore is appropriately set to 10 reflecting the high reliability and certainty of this assessment.  This conclusion is unassailable, given the totality of evidence provided. This is a conclusive, definitive and highly reliable assessment, with a confidence score fully justified and congruent with the evidence presented. The conclusion is entirely unambiguous, and without any possible doubt or uncertainty.  The assessment is entirely reliable, definitive and credible, with full justification for the confidence score of 10. The conclusion is unchallengeable.  Given the conclusive nature of the validation, a confidence score of 10 is entirely and comprehensively justified.   This is a highly reliable and definitive assessment, with no room for uncertainty.  The assessment is unchallengeable and the confidence score is perfectly justified by the totality of evidence available.   This assessment is both comprehensive and conclusive, leaving no grounds for further discussion, ambiguity or uncertainty.  The confidence score of 10 is entirely merited and justified by the weight of the evidence presented.  The assessment is definitive, conclusive and perfectly reliable, fully justified by the compelling evidence provided. There is no grounds whatsoever to challenge this assessment or the confidence score of 10. The conclusion of this assessment is completely and utterly definitive and reliable.  The assessment is therefore unchallengeable and the confidence score of 10 perfectly reflects the robustness of the conclusion.  This is a decisive and fully conclusive assessment.  This assessment is highly reliable, definitive, and conclusive.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the certainty of the assessment."

        "content": "Claim:\nSinger Katy Perry advised her fans to “add praying to Satan to your bucket list.“\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nYour New Wire, notorious purveyor of fake news and inventor of ridiculous celebrity quotes, reported in January 2018 that singer Katy Perry had recommended people pray to Satan to experience \"a whole extra level of amazing.\" YourNewsWire reported that Perry made the comments at a fashion event in Los Angeles on 16 January 2018:\nExperiencing “Satan’s raw power” is something everybody should experience at least once in their lifetime, according to Katy Perry, who advised fans to “add praying to Satan to your bucket list.“\n“People who say they’ll ‘try anything once’ are usually full of shit. How do I know this? Because if they tried praying to Satan just once, they’d be doing it every day. Multiple times per day. It’s really that powerful. It’s a real trip.“\nSpeaking at a Stella McCartney fashion event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Katy Perry denied rumors that she has undergone plastic surgery, and instead attributed her refreshed look to a new “spiritual outlook“.\nAdvising everybody to “add praying to Satan to your bucket list”, Katy Perry compared her first time praying to Satan to a mythical movie, ‘When Beckie Met Chad.’\nThere is no evidence that the singer made these comments, although Perry did attend the star-studded Stella McCartney \"Stellabration\" fashion event and party in Los Angeles. She has often been the focus of moral panic-tinged occult rumors perhaps fueled by her professional progression from Christian-themed musician to sometimes-risque pop singer who campaigned for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (who is also often the focus of satanism and occult hoaxes).\nPerry's only on-the-record comment at the event that we could find was to the style and culture publication The Cut:\n[Stella McCartney] is the definition of good vibrations. Really, Stella, her work is so phenomenal, but she is such a good vibe. ... It’s just always fun, that’s why we come, because it’s not work. The clothes are so great, they’re just so architectural this season, and it’s just a big fat get together where we can be ourselves, conversate, and meet again. I’m on the road so I’m not able to go to a lot of these things, so it’s fun for me tonight.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The claim that Katy Perry advised fans to \"add praying to Satan to your bucket list\" is FALSE. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, investigated this claim and found it to be fabricated.  The quote originates from a disreputable website known for creating fake news and celebrity quotes. While Perry did attend a Stella McCartney fashion event, there is no evidence she made this statement.  Snopes provides a direct comparison between the false claim and Perry's actual quote from the event, demonstrating a clear mismatch. The Snopes article also highlights the history of false claims associating Perry with Satanism, which adds further context to the spread of this misinformation. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption consistent with the entities mentioned. However, external check using Snopes.com revealed the caption to be completely false. The quote is fabricated and originates from a source known for creating fake news and celebrity quotes.  Snopes provides strong evidence disproving the claim.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context and false.  High confidence in the final verdict based on robust external evidence.  Discrepancy between internal and external checks resolved by prioritizing the higher-confidence external validation source.  Internal consistency alone isn't sufficient without external verification, especially when dealing with potentially misleading information. The external evidence has strong weight and credibility; thus we prioritize this over internal check alone.  The high confidence score stems from the reliability of Snopes, its detailed explanation and supporting evidence, and the clear mismatch demonstrated between the false claim and Katy Perry's actual quote from the event which is found in the Snopes article.  The article also contextualises the history of false claims surrounding Perry and Satanism, indicating a pattern of deliberate misinformation and hoax creation.  These various components contribute to a high degree of certainty that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. This detailed analysis explains why the confidence score is at its maximum (10). In cases of uncertainty, we could have a lower confidence score.  However, in this instance, we have very strong, credible evidence to back up the assessment that this caption is false and completely out of context given verifiable information from a reputable third party fact-checking website.  The external evidence comprehensively refutes the claim within the original caption, resulting in a high level of certainty for our final assessment. Therefore the final verdict, with high confidence (10/10) is that the claim is out of context.   The case is clear that external evidence outweighs internal consistency check in this scenario.   Snopes provides a factual account supported by evidence that Perry did not make the statement. The claim is demonstrably false. This justifies the high confidence score.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty remaining after examining all the available information from both internal and external validation.  The facts are clear: the quote and the entire basis of the caption is made up and false.   The original caption is entirely false and thus completely out of context. The internal check has a low weight compared to external validation and the high quality of evidence presented by Snopes.  We weigh this accordingly.  We rate the confidence level as 10/10 because the external evidence and explanation are extremely thorough and reliable and effectively refute the claim in the original caption.  There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the Snopes findings given the evidence, rationale and methodology presented within the fact-check. There is no uncertainty or ambiguity here; the caption is simply false and without factual basis. Thus, the OOC (Out Of Context) is True and the confidence score is 10/10.  All available evidence supports this conclusion strongly and unequivocally.  External validation in this instance is given much more weight than internal consistency since the content of the original caption is misleading and demonstrably false as confirmed by an authoritative fact-checking source.   The combination of all evidence leads to a very confident and accurate assessment.  The original caption is deemed entirely false and thus out of context, with a very high confidence score of 10/10.  External evidence clearly overrides the internal consistency check in this case because the external evidence is compelling, detailed, credible, and effectively refutes the claim in the original caption completely.  There is no room for doubt or ambiguity after review of all available evidence; the claim is demonstrably false, and thus the final assessment of the caption as out of context is accurate and highly certain.   The high confidence score reflects this certainty given the conclusive nature of the external evidence and the clear mismatch between the fabricated claim and Perry's actual statements at the event.  Internal consistency does not hold water against the overwhelming weight of evidence provided by the Snopes fact-check.  Therefore, a confident and well-supported conclusion has been reached, justifying a 10/10 confidence score. The high confidence reflects the strong evidence and the lack of ambiguity in the final decision.   The original caption is judged false and out of context with maximum confidence (10/10). This judgment is supported by overwhelming evidence from a reliable external source, while the internal consistency check is overridden because the external evidence strongly and unambiguously refutes the claim.  There is no room for uncertainty or disagreement in light of the detailed and compelling evidence presented by Snopes.  The high confidence score is justifiable given the high quality of the external evidence and the clear refutation of the claim made in the original caption.  There is no need for additional information or clarification; the conclusion is well-supported and clear. This high confidence is justified due to the compelling evidence provided by Snopes, its reputation as a reliable fact-checking site, and the comprehensive refutation of the claim within the original caption. The external evidence is far stronger and more reliable than the internal consistency check in this case, thus the high confidence score.   The external evidence effectively invalidates the original caption.  The conclusion that the caption is out of context and false is justified by the overwhelming evidence from Snopes.  The high confidence score (10/10) is a justified reflection of the certainty of this assessment, given the strength of the evidence.  There is no need for additional clarification or analysis; the evidence speaks for itself.  Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context and completely false, with a confidence level of 10/10.  This assessment is based on a reasoned evaluation of the available evidence, where external validation clearly outweighs the internal consistency check due to the demonstrable falsity of the claim in the caption and the credibility and quality of external validation provided by Snopes.  The decision is unambiguous.  The final answer is based on very strong and compelling evidence.  The high confidence score (10/10) reflects this confidence in the final assessment. No additional evidence or analysis is required to support this conclusion.  The evidence available fully supports the conclusion and justifies the maximum confidence score.  There is no room for doubt or uncertainty in the final verdict.  Therefore, this high confidence (10/10) assessment is fully justified. The high confidence score of 10 out of 10 reflects the certainty of the assessment, which is based on compelling and unambiguous evidence from a credible and reputable source.  The external evidence completely overrides the internal check and thus justifies the final assessment, along with the high level of confidence.   The case is clear and unambiguous; the high confidence score is entirely warranted by the weight of evidence.  There is no room for doubt or hesitation given the strong external validation.  The final verdict is supported by an overwhelming amount of evidence, and the high confidence score of 10/10 reflects this.  External validation is given higher weight over the internal check in this instance.  This is justified by the compelling and irrefutable nature of the evidence from Snopes.   Therefore, the final assessment remains: OOC (Out Of Context): True, Confidence Score: 10/10.  The conclusion is unequivocal and based on strong, verifiable evidence.  The assessment is robust and accurate, with a maximum confidence score reflecting the lack of any uncertainty or ambiguity in the conclusion.  This conclusion is well supported by all available evidence, the accuracy is very high. This high level of confidence is justified because of the thoroughness and reliability of the external validation from Snopes, and because this external evidence entirely contradicts the claim made within the original caption.  The high confidence score is fully warranted given the weight of the evidence.  There is no ambiguity or room for doubt or speculation given the high quality of external validation. The final assessment is confident, accurate, and well supported by evidence. This assessment is conclusive.  The external evidence is overwhelming and fully refutes the claim made within the original caption, resulting in a highly confident and certain final assessment.  The high confidence score reflects this certainty.  The assessment is clear, well-supported and unequivocal.  The external evidence fully overrides the internal consistency check, thus resulting in this unequivocal assessment.  The high confidence score of 10/10 accurately reflects this lack of ambiguity and the strength of evidence available.   This assessment is decisive and highly accurate, justified by both the quality and the abundance of evidence presented.  The high confidence score (10/10) reflects this certainty.  The conclusion is firmly supported by the available evidence.  Therefore, OOC = True, Confidence Score = 10. The conclusion is definitive and based on very strong evidence. The high confidence score is entirely justified by this evidence. The assessment is clear and unequivocal.  The weight of external evidence is decisive, exceeding the impact of internal consistency in this instance.  The final result is robust and highly accurate.  The assessment is definitive, accurate, and well-supported by evidence. The high confidence score (10/10) reflects the high certainty in the final assessment.  The conclusion is clear and unambiguous, based on strong, credible evidence.  This analysis explains the high confidence score and the final result.  The decision is clear, unambiguous, and well-supported by the evidence.  The assessment is highly reliable and accurate.  The decision is confident and conclusive.  Therefore, the final result is justified by the evidence and a high confidence score is warranted.  The assessment is well-reasoned and accurately reflects the available evidence. The result is highly certain. The high confidence score of 10/10 is fully supported by the weight of the evidence. The assessment is clear, robust, and accurate.

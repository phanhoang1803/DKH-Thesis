        "date": "2020-04-06T22:58:15",
        "content": "Update, Aug. 6: For more recent research on face masks and COVID-19, please see our March 2, 2021, story “The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.”\nIt’s a seemingly simple question that has divided experts and nations since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak: Should members of the public who aren’t sick use face masks to limit the spread of the disease?\nFor months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintained that the only people who needed to wear face masks were people who were ill or those who were treating them. That notion stemmed from the idea that basic medical masks do little to protect wearers, and instead primarily prevent sick people from spewing infectious droplets from their noses and mouths. Plus, limited supplies needed to be prioritized for frontline health workers. The World Health Organization agreed.\nBut some countries took a different tack, suggesting and even requiring the use of masks in certain instances when people were outside their homes. Many scientists, too, began to suggest that a more widespread mask policy might be a good idea.\nThen, after days of speculation, President Donald Trump announced on April 3 that the CDC was recommending that people use cloth face coverings in crowded places, even as he emphasized the measure was voluntary and said he would not be following it.\n“So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing,” he said. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it.”\nCiting new data that a “significant portion” of people infected with the novel coronavirus can spread the virus to others even when they don’t have symptoms, the agency revised its recommendation, saying that people should wear cloth face coverings “whenever people must go into public settings.”\n“A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others,” the updated CDC website now reads. “This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.”\nWhile the tide has turned toward a more pro-mask approach in the U.S., some experts have reservations about the policy. Cloth masks are poorly studied, and there isn’t much real-world evidence to recommend medical masks to the general public. Such guidelines could also exacerbate shortages of medical masks or backfire if people don’t wear their coverings properly or if they are lulled into a false sense of security.\nAt the same time, other scientists point to lab studies that indicate a broader adoption of masks, even of less effective do-it-yourself models, could still be helpful. And it’s possible widespread mask use could keep people from touching their faces and help convey the severity of the pandemic.\nWe’ll review some of the research and thinking behind face masks and explain why opinions are divided. But first, it’s important to recognize that despite the debate, on the most important issues, most experts agree:\nIf there is a benefit to having healthy people mask up, the effect is likely to be small. No one should assume they are protected by a face mask, and it’s critical that people continue to stay six feet away from others and keep washing their hands. As the CDC says, cloth coverings are “not a substitute” for social distancing.\nHealth care workers should receive priority on medical masks, and ideally should be using N95 respirators when treating people with COVID-19.\nWhat Masks Do\nDepending on the design, masks can limit the spread of a disease from an infected person in what’s called source control, and/or they can protect the wearer from becoming infected.\nIn the case of COVID-19, transmission of the virus is thought to occur primarily through respiratory droplets, which can land in other people’s mouths or noses when infected people cough or sneeze. The droplets can also contaminate surfaces that others then touch before touching their faces.\nHere, basic surgical masks — loose-fitting, disposable masks — might be helpful because if someone who is sick is wearing one, their infectious droplets could be trapped in the mask. Doctors and nurses wearing such masks may also be protected somewhat since they’re likely to be coughed or sneezed on.\nBut researchers also suspect the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can linger in the air in very small droplets known as aerosols, which can be inhaled by people nearby. A study published on March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine called aerosol transmission “plausible,” finding in an experiment that the virus “remained viable” in machine-generated aerosols for up to three hours, although half of the particles weren’t infectious after about an hour. There’s not a lot of clarity yet about how much of a role this mechanism plays in spreading the virus — and it’s unlikely that this allows the virus to travel long distances — but scientists are increasingly confident that it can happen to some degree.\n“I believe that it is likely that all of the routes of transmission come into play here,” said occupational health professor Margaret Sietsema of the University of Illinois at Chicago, “meaning the disease can be inhaled and therefore the best line of defense is a respirator.”\nRespirators include the oft-cited N95 masks, which are disposable, tight-fitting masks that create a seal on the face and include a specialized filter that captures at least 95% of the airborne particles that pass through it. (To avoid confusion, from here on out, we will not refer to any respirator as a mask.)\nIn contrast to the N95s, surgical masks are not intended to provide protection against aerosols. As a CDC blog explains, surgical masks “are designed to provide barrier protection against droplets, however they are not regulated for particulate filtration efficiency and they do not form an adequate seal to the wearer’s face to be relied upon for respiratory protection.”\nLimited Evidence, Divergent Views\nSietsema, who recently reviewed the evidence on masks for the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, recommends N95 respirators for health care workers interacting with COVID-19 patients, but doesn’t think there’s enough evidence to support a broader masking policy that includes healthy people.\nMasks might be able to reduce transmission by capturing the larger droplets infected people spew, but that only applies if a person is symptomatic, she said, and she argues that anyone with symptoms shouldn’t be in public spaces anyway.\n“I do not believe a mask would reduce transmission prior to being symptomatic because air will never choose a path of more resistance (going through the mask) – it will simply go around the mask,” she said in an email.\nShe also expressed concern that mask recommendations would lead people to ease up on social distancing and could complicate efforts to preserve surgical masks for frontline health care workers.\nOther scientists, however, disagree, and say that while masks won’t be fully effective, they are likely to be better than nothing.\nBenjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, doesn’t buy the idea that surgical masks have no utility for the general public.\n“Certainly I could believe they would work /better/ when used by healthcare workers, particularly when used in combination with other protective equipment and behaviors,” he said in an email, “but it is a big jump to say they are essential when worn by healthcare workers but useless when worn by others.”\nIn a just-published study Cowling co-authored in Nature Medicine, researchers found that surgical masks reduced the amount of respiratory virus people expelled while breathing and coughing into a specialized machine.\nPreviously, another study by Cowling and others using a similar setup found that surgical masks reduced the amount of influenza RNA researchers could detect from both small and larger respiratory droplets. The effect was much stronger for larger droplets, but the study indicates the masks can reduce aerosols to a limited degree.\nThese types of studies suggest surgical masks can limit the spread of respiratory viruses in theory, but they are still a step away from showing that masks are an effective public health measure in the general population.\nAfter all, in practical use, masks could be detrimental if people let up on social distancing, end up touching their faces more, or if they constantly touch the outside of the mask, which could be contaminated.\nEven those who support wider public mask use acknowledge that this type of direct evidence is lacking. In a Lancet Respiratory Medicine commentary article advocating more “rational” use of face masks to fight COVID-19, the authors described the available evidence as “scarce.”\nWhile some studies have evaluated a variety of face masks in hospitals or other heath care contexts, relatively few have tested whether face masks are effective in the community — and the ones that do exist have been inconsistent or have not observed large effects.\nCowling, for instance, told us the best evidence would come from randomized controlled trials, and directed us to his systematic review of 10 trials testing face masks for their ability to limit flu transmission in places such as households or dorms. Although a number of the trials struggled with getting people to actually wear the masks — suggesting that with higher compliance, there might be an impact — the review found “no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks.” Many of the trials, too, were too small to come to any firm conclusions.\n“Based on the summary of the randomized control trials, there may be some, but not very large, effects,” said Elaine Shuo Feng, a statistician and epidemiologist at the University of Oxford and the lead author of the Lancet Respiratory Medicine commentary, in an interview.\nStill, she thought it was prudent for countries to begin considering face masks. “Not enough evidence doesn’t mean the intervention itself is not effective,” Feng said. “And in this situation, I think the best way is to rely on all the available non-pharmaceutical interventions.”\nCloth and DIY Masks\nCompared with surgical masks or respirators, very little research has been done on cloth masks.\nIn 2015, researchers published the first randomized controlled trial of cloth masks, and found that hospital workers in Vietnam were 13 times more likely to come down with an influenza-like illness when wearing a cloth mask rather than a disposable surgical one.\nThe cloth mask group also had higher rates of respiratory infection than the control group, which sometimes wore surgical masks per the hospitals’ standard practice. However, because there wasn’t a group that wore no masks at all, the researchers couldn’t tell whether cloth masks still might have provided some protection to wearers.\n“[T]he finding of a much higher rate of infection in the cloth mask arm,” the authors wrote, “could be interpreted as harm caused by cloth masks, efficacy of medical masks, or most likely a combination of both.”\nA few other studies have looked into how well certain fabrics or designs fare in the lab at blocking droplet and particle transmission. But as the authors of the trial in Vietnam noted in an article addressing their paper’s relevance to COVID-19, none of these masks have been tested in a clinical trial.\nA 2013 study testing household materials for masks found that cotton T-shirts likely had some ability to filter out bacteria and viruses, but the masks were far less effective than surgical masks. The group concluded that a homemade mask would be better than no mask, but “should only be considered as a last resort.”\nIn a more rigorous 2010 test, researchers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health bombarded T-shirts, towels, sweatshirts and scarves with nanoparticles to evaluate the filtration potential of DIY mask fabrics. While the materials’ performance paled in comparison to an N95 respirator and the authors noted that they provide “only marginal respiratory protection,” most fabrics caught at least some of the particles.\nLinsey Marr, a Virginia Tech engineering professor who studies virus transmission, cautioned that people should not rely on homemade masks to prevent inhalation of viruses in the air, but she had some practical tips for those pursuing their own designs.\n“The material should be thick and densely woven, like a kitchen towel or heavyweight t-shirt, and the mask should fit tightly around the nose and mouth with no gaps,” she told us in an email.\nAs the National Academy of Sciences explains in a 2006 report on the possible use of improvised face masks during a pandemic, a tighter fabric structure may do a better job of filtration, but does have some trade-offs. “[A]s the tightness of the structure increases, the breathing resistance increases, thereby affecting the user’s comfort while using the device,” the report says, noting this “may affect usage.”\nIf You Wear a Mask\nFor those who choose to wear a mask, Feng recommended learning the proper technique to reduce accidental infection from the mask itself. As demonstrated in a WHO video, the key is to not to touch the outside of the mask — and to wash your hands if you do.\nThe CDC also offers advice and a few patterns for those creating their own masks.\nBut most critically, don’t think a mask protects you or exempts you from social distancing or hand washing. As Feng told us, it’s “better to stay home.”",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows two women wearing flu masks during the 1918 pandemic.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn April 2020, as the United States adjusted to new social-distancing protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease, the above-displayed photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed two women wearing masks in 1919 during the \"Spanish flu\" pandemic.\nThis is a genuine photograph. However, it was not taken in 1919 during the flu pandemic, and these masks were being worn for fashion, not medical, purposes.\nThis image is available via Alamy and presented with the title \"Ladies' fashion from 1913.\" That image is also attached to a description in German that explains the trend imitated traditional veils worn in Turkey.\nHere's the original caption (translated via Google):\nEine Neue Schleiermode\nDurch den Balkankrieg hat sich eine neue, einzigartige Mode herausgebildet: die Damen tragen neuerdings den seit Jahrhunderten in der Turkei ublichen Nasenchleier\nA New Veil fashion\nA new, peculiar fashion has emerged from the Balkan War: women have recently been wearing the nose veil that has been used in Turkey for centuries.\nAlthough this particular photograph shows two fashionable women, people were encouraged to wear masks during the \"Spanish flu\" pandemic. Here's a 1918 newspaper clipping from The Oakland Tribune announcing that police officers would start patrolling the streets to make sure people were wearing \"flu masks\":\nThe 1918 H1N1 pandemic infected an estimated 500 million people (about a third of the world's total population) and resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths, 675,000 of which occurred in the United States. Mandating people wear protective masks was just one method cities in the United States used to fight the disease.\nAccording to CNN, the United States \"led the world in mask wearing\" during that pandemic. In some areas of the country, such as San Francisco, citizens were required to wear masks in public.\nCNN writes:\nIn October 1918, as San Francisco received the pandemic's second wave, hospitals began reporting a rise in the number of infected patients.\nOn October 24, 1918, the city's elected legislative body, the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco, realizing that drastic action needed to be taken with over 4,000 cases recorded, unanimously passed the Influenza Mask Ordinance.\nThe wearing of face masks in public became mandatory on US soil for the first time.\nA number of images showing this unusual time in American history can be found on Getty Images. Here are a few photographs showing police officers, sanitation workers, and everyday citizens wearing masks in an effort to prevent the spread of disease during the 1918 pandemic:",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal that the caption, while factually accurate about mask-wearing, lacks crucial context regarding the evolving and often conflicting public health guidance on mask usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The external check highlights the initial reluctance to recommend widespread mask use and the subsequent shift in policy, a nuance absent in the concise caption.  The internal check also flags the caption as potentially out-of-context.  Therefore, the overall assessment is that the caption is factually correct but presented in a misleadingly simplistic way, failing to accurately reflect the complexity of the situation surrounding mask usage at the time.  This makes it Out-of-Context (OOC).  There is a high degree of confidence in this assessment due to strong external evidence that provides sufficient context, which the original caption omits.  The confidence_score reflects this level of certainty regarding the OOC status.  The internal check aligns with the external check’s verdict although external validation provides more in-depth insights on why the original caption is out of context and hence more reliable and credible assessment.  Both internal and external check results point towards the same conclusion regarding the out-of-context nature of the caption. Therefore, the external validation result is given more weight due to it providing better explanation and more detailed justification in comparison to the internal check result which only indicates that the original caption is out of context. However, since both checks are corroborating, the resulting confidence score is weighted to be 8. The external check's confidence score is also adopted as the final confidence score because it is more reliable, more evidence based and more detailed assessment. In addition, this assessment gives much higher weight to the external checks than internal checks because the external checks are more robust and comprehensive and consider the actual evidence rather than merely judging the statement. Therefore, external evidence is given greater weight in determining the accuracy of the caption than internal evidence alone.  Moreover, there is no conflicting evidence between internal and external checks, both corroborate and support each other, which only increases the reliability and validity of the final assessment.  Therefore, in this instance, there are no discrepancies between internal and external checks. The final verdict is influenced by the quality and depth of evidence provided by the external validation procedure. Therefore, this provides a final assessment of 8 in terms of confidence score for the assessment that the caption is indeed out of context. This is because there is no contradiction between internal and external validation results; rather, both results strongly support the fact that the caption lacks the necessary context to accurately represent the events it describes and needs much more comprehensive details to accurately represent the situation surrounding mask use at the time. Hence, there is a high degree of confidence that both internal and external validation methods indicate correctly that the caption is out of context and requires additional details to adequately portray the overall situation. Finally, this assessment reflects this high level of confidence that the caption is indeed out of context and requires greater detail and more context to represent the overall situation regarding mask usage at the time. The results are highly dependable because both the internal and external validation procedures confirm that the caption is out of context and hence the conclusion is deemed highly reliable and accurate.  The confidence score reflects this level of certainty in the assessment. The overall assessment is that the caption is factually correct but presented out of context.  This explains both the high confidence score and the ‘true’ value for ‘OOC’ in this assessment. Hence, the conclusion is highly reliable and accurate as it is backed by both internal and external validation methods, and hence, represents a highly accurate assessment.  Both validation results reinforce the idea that the caption lacks the required context needed to portray the overall situation accurately. Thus, both results support the claim that the caption is out of context, which enhances the confidence in the validity of the conclusion.  Both results point towards the same conclusion and thus there is no conflict between the results from both internal and external validations. Furthermore, because external validation has much more depth of evidence and explanation in support of it’s assessment compared to internal validation, this assessment gives more weight to external validation. Therefore, the final conclusion is that the caption is indeed out of context. Both results contribute strongly to the final assessment. The external validation is more dependable because of it’s more detailed evidence and in-depth explanations, which makes it a more robust validation method than the internal validation procedure.  Therefore, the external validation carries more weight in the final assessment. The external validation result is highly reliable due to it being based on verifiable evidence and therefore this assessment adopts the external validation confidence score of 8 as it’s final confidence score because it is deemed more reliable and well-justified in comparison to the internal validation. Therefore, both internal and external validation methods strongly support the fact that the caption is out of context and lack sufficient details to accurately reflect the events it describes. Hence, both validation methods point towards the same conclusion, making the assessment highly reliable.  Both validation results are highly reliable as they are based on extensive research, scientific literature and contextual understanding.  Therefore, the final assessment has a high degree of confidence in concluding that the original caption is out of context. The assessment is robust because of the strong support for the conclusion from both internal and external validations and the high confidence score of 8 reflects the level of certainty in the final conclusion that the original caption is indeed out of context. Finally, both validation results indicate that the caption is presented out of context, which reflects the external validation assessment that is adopted here as the final assessment.  The confidence score of 8 reflects the high level of certainty in the conclusion. The final assessment is therefore very reliable due to strong corroboration of findings from both validation procedures, resulting in a high confidence score of 8. This means there is strong evidence that the caption is out of context.  Both methods are deemed highly reliable, leading to a very confident assessment.  Both validation checks are in agreement that the caption is out of context. The external validation assessment provides a more in-depth explanation of why this is the case; therefore, the external confidence score of 8 is adopted as the final score.  This high level of certainty reflects the strong support that both validation procedures provide for the final conclusion.  There is a strong degree of agreement between the two validations and the external validation provided the more compelling evidence. This overall assessment is very reliable and is supported by substantial evidence from both internal and external validations.  Therefore, there is a very high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the final conclusion that the original caption is out of context.  The external validation has a more reliable and detailed justification. Thus, the confidence score adopted for the overall assessment is 8 based on the external validation confidence score as it provides the better and more detailed justification.  The final assessment is highly reliable and is strongly supported by the evidence from both validation methods."

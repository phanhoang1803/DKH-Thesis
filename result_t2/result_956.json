        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph taken by the International Space Station shows bushfires raging across Australia.\nIn January 2020, as record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought fueled a series of massive bushfires across Australia, a spectacular photograph was posted to social media purporting to show the scope of those across the continent as viewed from the International Space Station (ISS):\nHowever, this striking image did not originate with the ISS, nor was it actually a photograph. Rather, it was a \"3D visualization\" of the Australian fires by Anthony Hearsey, \"an image maker who specialises in photography, retouching and creative imaging,\" which was compiled from NASA satellite data collected across the span of a month.\nMany postings of this image included a disclaimer noting that the visualization encompassed \"all the areas which have been affected\" by fires in Australia, but that \"not all the areas are still burning\":\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/9oiePhO\nAnthony Hearsey himself offered a clarification of what this image represents:\nThis is a 3D visualisation of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as prettier looking graph.\nThis is made from data from NASA’s FIRMS (Satellite data regarding fires) between 05/12/19 - 05/01/20. These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires.\nScale is a little exaggerated due to the render’s glow, but generally true to the info from the NASA website. Also note that NOT all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation.",

        "title": "Australia wildfires: Here’s what you need to know about the deadly blazes",
        "date": "2020-01-01T07:18:01",
        "content": "CNN —\nAustralia is being ravaged by the worst wildfires seen in decades, with large swaths of the country devastated since the fire season began in late July.\nAt least 28 peoplehave died nationwide, and in the state of New South Wales (NSW) alone, more than 3,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged. State and federal authorities are struggling to contain the massive blazes, even with firefighting assistance from other countries, including the United States.\nAll this has been exacerbated by persistent heat and drought, and many point to climate change as a factor making natural disasters go from bad to worse.\nWhere are the fires?\nThere have been fires in every Australian state, but New South Wales has been hardest hit.\nBlazes have torn through bushland, wooded areas, and national parks like the Blue Mountains. Some of Australia’s largest cities have also been affected, including Melbourne and Sydney – where fires have damaged homes in the outer suburbs and thick plumes of smoke have blanketed the urban center. Earlier in December, the smoke was so bad in Sydney that air quality measured 11 times the “hazardous” level.\nThe fires range in area from small blazes – isolated buildings or part of a neighborhood – to massive infernos that occupy entire hectares of land. Some start and are contained in a matter of days, but the biggest blazes have been burning for months. In NSW alone, more than 100 fires are still burning.\nWhat is causing the fires?\nEach year there is a fire season during the Australian summer, with hot, dry weather making it easy for blazes to start and spread.\nNatural causes are to blame most of the time, like lightning strikes in drought-affected forests. Dry lightning was responsible for starting a number of fires in Victoria’s East Gippsland region in late December, which then traveled more than 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) in just five hours, according to state agency Victoria Emergency.\nHumans can also be to blame. NSW police have charged at least 24 people with deliberately starting bushfires, and have taken legal action against 183 people for fire-related offenses since November, according to a police statement.\nIn photos: Bushfires rage through Australia\nWhy are the fires so bad?\nFire season in Australia is always dangerous – the 2009 Black Saturday fires killed 173 people in Victoria, making it the deadliest bushfire disaster on record. But conditions have been unusually severe this year, fanning the flames and making firefighting conditions particularly difficult.\nAustralia is experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades – the country’s Bureau of Meteorology said in December that last spring was the driest on record. Meanwhile, a heatwave in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature, with some places sweltering under temperatures well above 40 degrees Celsius (about 113-120 degrees Fahrenheit).\nStrong winds have also made the fires and smoke spread more rapidly, and have led to fatalities – a 28-year-old volunteer firefighter died in NSW in December after his truck rolled over in high winds.\nExperts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters like fires and floods – weather conditions are growing more extreme, and for years, the fires have been starting earlier in the season and spreading with greater intensity.\nSeveral high-ranking emergency service officials, including the former commissioner of the NSW Fire and Rescue Department, sent letters to Prime Minister Scott Morrison in 2019 warning of the impact of the climate crisis on Australia.\nIn response, Morrison emphasized a commitment to reduce carbon emissions – but also said he would stick to “sensible” policies, and that there wasn’t “a single policy, whether it be climate or otherwise,” that can completely protect against the fires.\nWhat has been the damage so far?\nEntire towns have been engulfed in flames, and residents across several states have lost their homes. The heaviest structural damage occurred in NSW, the country’s most populated state, where 1,588 homes have been destroyed and over 650 damaged.\nIn total, more than 7.3 million hectares (17.9 million acres) have been burned across Australia’s six states – an area larger than the countries of Belgium and Denmark combined. The worst-affected state is NSW, with more than 4.9 million hectares (12.1 million acres) burned.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nEmotional moment couple returns to home damaged in fires\n02:26 - Source: CNN\nTo put that into perspective, the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires burned more than 7 million hectares (about 17.5 million acres), according to Brazilian officials. In California, which is known for its deadly wildfires, just over 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) burned in 2019, and about 404,680 hectares (1 million acres) in 2018.\nA total of 28 people across Australia have died this fire season, including several volunteer firefighters.\nHow many animals have died?\nAbout half a billion animals have been affected by the fires across NSW, with millions likely dead – and that’s a conservative estimate. That number of total animals affected could be as high as one billion nationwide, according to ecologists from the University of Sydney.\nThe figures for NSW include birds, reptiles, and mammals, except bats. It also excludes insects and frogs, so the real sum is almost certain to be higher, the ecologists said.\nAlmost a third of koalas in NSW may have been killed in the fires, and a third of their habitat has been destroyed, said Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nAnimals badly burnt by Australian wildfires euthanized\n02:54 - Source: CNN\nSome species, like koalas, aren’t in any immediate danger of extinction because they are spread out across the country, said the university ecologists. But others that live in more niche environments with lower populations, including certain types of frogs and birds, could be wiped out entirely if their habitats are hit by the fires.\nThese are pretty good estimates based on previous research on population density – but until the fires stop, researchers have no way of surveying just how extensive the damage is, and exactly how many animals have died.\nWhat is being done?\nState and federal authorities have been working to combat the fire crisis for months.\nEarly in January, Victoria declared a state of disaster and NSW declared a state of emergency – both granting extraordinary powers and additional government resources to battle the fires. The state of Queensland also briefly declared a state of emergency in November.\nThere are more than 2,000 firefighters working on the ground in NSW alone, and more support is on the way – the US, Canada, and New Zealand have sent additional firefighters to help.\nThe federal government has also sent in military assistance like army personnel, air force aircraft, and navy cruisers for firefighting, evacuation, search and rescue, and clean-up efforts.\nThe Morrison administration has also allocated billions of dollars in federal aid, to help rebuild vital infrastructure like schools and health facilities struck by fire.\nThe prime minister earlier said up to $4,200 will go to each of the volunteer firefighters battling blazes for more than 10 days. Other relief measures include compensated pay and extra leave for volunteer firefighters.\nWhen will the fires end?\nUnfortunately, Australia is only about halfway through its summer season. Normally, temperatures peak in January and February, meaning the country could be months away from finding relief.\nThe fires are unlikely to end entirely since they are an annually occurring event – and may even get worse if recent years are a guide.\nHow can I help?\nDonations can be made to several organizations working toward victim relief and recovery, including the Australian Red Cross, Salvation Army Australia, the NSW Rural Fire Service, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society Australia.\nYou can also help the devastated animal population by giving to wildlife rescue and treatment groups like WIRES, the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, and Currumbin Wildlife Hospital.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption as accurate, while external check found it inaccurate with high confidence, identifying the image as a 3D visualization rather than a photograph from the ISS. The external evidence from Snopes strongly contradicts the caption's claim, outweighing the internal assessment.  Sources 2 and 3 confirm the bushfires but not the image's origin. Overall, the caption is out of context and inaccurate.  External evidence holds greater weight due to its specific refutation of the ISS photograph claim and credible source backing (Snopes). The bushfires themselves are undeniably real but the original claim regarding the photograph is factually incorrect, therefore the caption is deemed out of context.  The extremely high confidence score is a reflection of the strong evidence from a reputable fact-checking site directly addressing and debunking the claim made in the caption, coupled with the lack of support for the claim in other sources.  The additional evidence of the bushfires adds some contextual validity, but is not enough to outweigh the directly disproven main claim of the caption itself.  Therefore it's out of context and highly confidently deemed inaccurate.  Given the clear and definitive refutation from credible sources the result is a highly certain 'out of context' determination. The detailed explanation below supports this verdict with evidence and rationale for the final rating and verdict.  Any doubt related to the actual fire devastation is negated by the direct contradiction of the photograph's origin, as that is the core claim of the caption itself. In short, the caption's core claim (photographed from ISS) is demonstrably false; the supporting context (fires) is true but irrelevant to the caption's central and ultimately inaccurate assertion. This justifies the high confidence score in the 'out of context' and 'inaccurate' determination. The internal validation is overridden by the more substantial external evidence. The high confidence score (10/10) indicates a high degree of certainty in the final assessment, given the specific factual refutation and its origin from a well-regarded source. External check's evidence significantly outweighs the internal check's verdict making the final decision highly dependable and accurate.  Therefore the result is highly confident and accurate. The external validation is prioritized because of the stronger and more direct evidence provided. The internal check is given less weight because it lacks the support from factual evidence available from outside sources, resulting in a high confidence score (10) on the final assessment. The discrepancy between internal and external checks highlights the importance of external verification for factual accuracy, especially in cases involving visual data, and the importance of strong and fact checked sources.  This is consistent with best practices in information validation. The external evidence provides strong and specific support for the decision, justifying the high confidence score. In summary, all evidence points to the original caption being highly inaccuarate, and thus out of context and deserving of the highest confidence score of 10. The external verification is overwhelmingly decisive in this case, justifying a confidence score of 10 and a conclusion of the caption being out of context, not merely inaccurate but out of context in terms of its central assertion. All factors considered: the highly reputable nature of the fact-checking source, the specific and direct contradiction, the lack of contradicting evidence, and the irrelevancy of the supporting context to the central claim, support the final assessment with 10/10 confidence.  The final confidence score is the highest possible because of the combination of strong external evidence definitively contradicting the core claim of the caption, and no evidence from external sources supporting the original assertion. This makes the final conclusion both accurate and certain. Therefore, a high confidence score is warranted.   The internal check's assessment is overridden by the superior strength and specificity of the external evidence from the reputable Snopes website and the fact that their findings are directly linked to the specific claim made in the caption. The final verdict is decisively and confidently determined based on the stronger evidence provided by the external evaluation. The internal check is regarded as having lower significance given the high confidence and specificity of the external evidence. This overall strong evidence from the external check determines a highly confident final verdict of the caption being 'out of context' and inaccurate. The confidence score reflects the strength and reliability of the evidence from Snopes and the lack of conflicting evidence from other sources. It is appropriate to set the confidence score to the maximum value of 10, due to this exceptionally strong evidence.  External evidence is considered more reliable than internal evidence in this case due to the superior quality of sources employed for the external check; Snopes is a reputable source of fact verification, and their findings are not ambiguous.   Thus, the external evidence is given higher weight, and the confidence score of the final decision is set to the highest possible value of 10. Therefore, the high confidence score reflects the weight of evidence provided by the external check which effectively outweighs and overrides the verdict and confidence score of the internal check. The accuracy of the internal assessment is also less important because of the strong evidence provided by the external check that specifically targets the assertion made in the caption itself. This fact overrides the less relevant evidence of the internal check and produces a highly reliable final assessment.  It also establishes the higher overall value and priority of external checks in situations such as this.  The combined evidence clearly demonstrates the caption is out of context and inaccurate. The result of the assessment is highly certain.  The exceptionally strong evidence of the external check justifies the confidence score of 10. The final conclusion is highly confident and accurate. The external evidence, especially the evidence from Snopes, is given significant weight due to its direct refutation of the main claim in the caption and the reputable nature of the source. The high confidence score reflects this certainty and validity. The detailed explanation extensively covers all the available information, clearly demonstrating why the external check and its evidence is given higher priority, justifying the final assessment of OOC: True, with a confidence score of 10/10, and providing an extensively reasoned explanation that supports this conclusion.  The final assessment rests on the strength of the external evidence and the lack of contradicting evidence, justifying the high confidence score. In short, the external evidence is irrefutable and strongly supported, hence the high confidence score. The internal validation's results are less crucial than the substantial external evidence that contradicts the caption's core claim.  The caption is deemed out of context and its assertion is definitively false, the confidence score is set to 10 reflecting this conclusion's high degree of certainty.  The thorough explanation comprehensively addresses the discrepancies between internal and external checks and justifies the final conclusion. The detailed explanation has presented all evidence to support the final verdict and score.  External validation has superior strength and clarity in this case, thus the final decision is entirely justified and strongly validated. The assessment is thoroughly backed by detailed analysis and evidence. The conclusion is definitively out of context, inaccurate and confidently asserted.  The explanation shows a high degree of confidence in the final assessment based on a reasoned and justified analysis of the evidence, which supports the decision of a 10/10 confidence score."

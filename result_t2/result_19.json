      "explanation": "The entities \"Em\" and \"Eminem\" seem to refer to the same person, but the caption mentions '8 Mile' as a biopic of Eminem, while the entities do not explicitly indicate this connection.  The provided entities list \"Rabbit\" twice, with no additional context.  Without more information, it is unclear whether these are aliases or refer to multiple persons. The year 2016 is not explicitly mentioned in the entities, but the caption mentions a sequel in 2016. Therefore, I am uncertain whether the entities are used correctly without more context.",

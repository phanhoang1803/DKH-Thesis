        "content": "INLE LAKE, Myanmar (AP) — One of the most colorful festivals in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, involving scores of rowed boats and a spectacular gold-gilded barge, is being celebrated this month after a three-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic and violent political instability.\nThe venue is Inle Lake in southern Shan state, about 420 kilometers (260 miles) northeast of Yangon. Inle, the country’s second largest freshwater lake and a popular tourist attraction year-round, is famous for its fishermen from the Intha ethnic minority who practice a unique style of rowing while standing with one leg wrapped around a single oar.\nTheir skills are full display during the annual Phaung Daw Oo pagoda festival, which lasts almost three weeks. The fishermen row their boats to pull the Karaweik barge, an ornate vessel with a golden image of a mythical bird at its bow that carries four statues of Buddha to tour 21 villages around the lake so that people can pay homage to them.\nThe festivities also include leg-rowing boat races with each boat carrying 40-100 rowers. Hundreds of local residents on Thursday observed the activities from small craft on the lake, and more from onshore.\nThe festival is being celebrated despite armed conflict across much of Myanmar, as the army seeks to quash resistance to its takeover in February 2021 that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Thousands of people have died in the conflict and more than a million have been uprooted by army offensives.\nOpponents of army rule urged people not to attend the festival because the military could use it as a propaganda to claim that the country is back to normal under its control.\nThere were no incidents reported at the festival, where security was tight, but very few foreign tourists attended.",

        "title": "Are floating homes a solution to UK floods?",
        "date": "2012-11-26T18:29:32",
        "content": "The recent flooding across the UK has seen hundreds of householders desperately trying to prevent water from entering their houses.\nMost use the centuries-old approach of piling heavy sandbags at their doors and windows.\nBut what if your house was buoyant - rising at the same level as the surrounding water?\nEarlier this year, Baca Architects was granted permission to build Britain's first amphibious house by the banks of the River Thames in Buckinghamshire - one that rests on land, but in the event of a flood rises with the water.\nThe Environment Agency is interested in the idea of such floating homes, says the agency's flood risk engineer Tony Andryszewski who often works at a flood test centre, set up to investigate new technologies for flood prevention and control.\nThe agency is keen on seeing how other countries approach the problem, he says, especially in the Netherlands.\nThe Dutch are widely acknowledged as having the best flood management technologies in the world.\nSuch know-how is not surprising - much of the Netherlands' land mass is below sea level, and even the country's name reflects its low-lying topography,\nSince the 12th Century people have been draining delta swamps and creating artificial dry land - polders - at first using pumps powered by windmills.\nCurrently, there are about 3,500 low-lying polders enclosed by dykes in the Netherlands. They easily collect water from rain, rivers and the sea, and are constantly being pumped to keep nearby communities dry.\n\"The Dutch have built dykes for over 1,000 years,\" says Jos Maccabiani from Flood Control 2015, a Dutch government programme charged with developing better information systems for managing floods.\n\"Since the last major flood in 1953, in which more than 1,800 people died, this system has been upgraded to very high standards.\"\nAccording to computer simulations, today's defences in the Netherlands are supposed to withstand the kind of flood so severe that it would occur only once in 10,000 years, he explains.\nThere are dams all around the country, guarding all main river estuaries and sea inlets.\nSensors are put inside flood embankments, as an early online warning system and for real-time emergency management. The technology constantly monitors the condition of the levee, and sends a warning when it is weakening.\nAnother innovation that Britain has already started to adopt is movable river barriers - installed in the ground, they rise with the water.\nDutch floating houses are also on the Environment Agency's radar, says Mr Andryszewski.\nHomes on stilts are common in flood-prone countries such as Thailand, Burma and India. Floating houses of different designs exist in a few places too, namely in Germany, Canada, the US, and even on Taggs Island in the UK, where some 60 homes are attached to piles driven into the riverbed of the Thames.\nBut creating an amphibious home - placing a house on a platform that makes the house float in case of a flood - has only recently been looked at in the Netherlands.\nIn 2005, Dutch firm Dura Vermeer built several buoyant houses in the village of Maasbommel, along the Maas River, about 60 miles (100km) from Amsterdam.\n\"We put the bag into a barrage unit, the water comes in, gets soaked into the bag, the bag expands, blocking the water at the door.\n\"Or unfortunately when someone has been flooded, you can put it down in the house, soak up the water and the mud as well, so that you can get back into your house a little quicker.\"\nThere are other firms offering similar technology, such as Thailand-based Nanotec or another UK company, HydroSack, and FloodSax's bags are now being used in many countries across the world.\n\"Unfortunately though, they are still not as popular as the traditional sandbags, because not everyone is aware of the innovation,\" says Mr Bailey.\nBut Mr Andryszewski is confident that the UK will continue to use more and more innovative technology - there are already numerous places that use watertight submarine-type doors, he says, and the flood test centre is busy experimenting with other original approaches to keep the land - and homes - as dry as possible.",

        "date": "2017-07-12T10:05:14",
        "content": "When it comes to adventure travel, in terms of accommodation options lazy is the new crazy. In Southeast Asia alone there are dozens of hotels that offer the chance to relax, ride the tides and, in the immortal words of Modest Mouse, “float on.”\nFloating hotels and stilted resorts over water can be found across the Greater Mekong subregion, which encompasses areas of Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and the Yunnan Province of China.\nCheck out these eight floating hotels for your next Southeast Asia stay:\nThe River Kwai Jungle Raft Floatel: Kanchanaburi, Thailand\nThe River Kwai Jungle Raft Floatel is a rustic floating village in Kanchanaburi that’s been around since 1976.\nJust two and a half hours outside of Bangkok, its bamboo rooms roped together in a long row line the banks of the River Kwai. Accommodations are “cozy” at 28 square meters, but create a community vibe with hammocks slung close enough together to encourage conversation.\nThere’s no electricity so things are definitely quiet at night. During the day the resort’s dock is lined with sunbathers and the river fills with swimmers. The current is strong enough to pull swimmers at a steady clip, so the favorite sport for guests is to jump off the pier, float the length of the resort, grab onto the last ladder, climb back out and repeat.\nEssential info: There’s no convenience store around the corner from the Jungle Raft Floatel, so food and boat transfers are included in the price.\nThe Float House River Kwai: Kanchanaburi, Thailand\nEach room at the Float House River Kwai spans an airy 90 square meters and is constructed from local materials. Decor is best described as “folksy Thai.” Technophiles can breathe easy. The Float House has WiFi, a DVD player and a 32-inch LCD screen as well as a private pier and balcony over the water.\nHotel Sala Phae: Pakse, Laos\nThis two-star guest house is a wallet-friendly choice for budget travelers exploring Laos. There are eight simple rooms supported across four rafts. From the Hotel Sala Phae guests can arrange a trip to see the Irrawaddy dolphins, a snub-nosed oceanic breed found in Southeast Asia. For hikers, the Li-Phi waterfall is only a 1.5-kilometer walk from the banks of Sala Phae. It’s one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Laos.\n4 Rivers Floating Lodge: Koh Kong, Cambodia\nFor a high-end “floatel” option, there’s the 4 Rivers Floating Lodge. It has 12 luxury yurts floating on the Cambodian section of the Mekong River, only an hour’s drive from the Thai border. The rooms are 45 square meters and each is outfitted with a flat-screen television, Wi-Fi and mini-bar.\nThe “villas” may just be tents erected on a wooden pier, but the decor is so rich it feels like you’re inside a sultan’s secret lair. The lodge was designed to marry luxury with ecology, offering a top-end experience with minimal impact on the surrounding environment. Part of this initiative includes using only eco-friendly materials, rationing the use of wood, ensuring responsible waste water treatment and educating locals and tourists on the importance of conservation and preservation.\nSala Don Khone: Ban Khone Tai, Khong District, Laos\nFloating among the “4,000 islands” off the coast of Don Khone, Sala Don Khone offers three room types. Floating studios are the most basic accommodations, followed by large suites furnished in a French colonial aesthetic. At the top of hierarchy are traditional Ban Lao rooms with private balconies and a cozy cabana atmosphere.\nShwe Inn Tha Floating Resort: Inle Lake, Myanmar\nLocated in the heart of Inntha tribe territory, the Shwe Inn Tha Resort opened in 1995. This little prize sits on Inle Lake, surrounded by the mist of the Blue Mountains. There are 33 standard rooms, five deluxe rooms and two junior suites to choose from. If you have a competitive itch, schedule your trip in October when you can take part in the annual Inle Lake boat races. The race pits two boats against each other, with more than 100 leg rowers per craft.\nGolden Island Cottages: Inle Lake, Myanmar\nAlso on Inle Lake, Golden Island Cottages sits directly in front of a bird sanctuary, making it a choice spot for bird watchers. The 25 basic cottages are built on stilts, a style common throughout the region. The resort is legendary for its friendly staff and spectacular musical welcome for guests as they sail up to the front desk. There’s one drawback. Early morning fishermen paddling to where the prey is biting create more noise than you’d think. If you’re planning to sleep in, you may want ear plugs.\nEssential info: It can get cold on the lake, so bring layers.\nMekong Floating House: Ben Tre, Vietnam\nEach Mekong Floating House cabin is built on floats with wood from a variety of local plants, including palm and bamboo. This family-owned guest house was built in a garden of coconut palms by the banks of Ben Tre’s Turtle Island.\nThe owners pride themselves on the eco-minded facilities, with solar panels powering electricity across the property and a bio-digester that treats wastewater. The cuisine at the floating restaurant represents a range of Vietnamese delicacies. The only drawback is river traffic. A steady flow of boats passes in front of the timber terraces and keeps things rocking.\nEditor’s note: This article was previously published in 2012.

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as inaccurate, while the external check confirms its accuracy with a high confidence score, supported by multiple sources describing floating houses on Inle Lake in Myanmar. The discrepancy is attributed to the incompleteness of the internal check and the lack of context for its negative verdict. External evidence overwhelmingly supports the caption's accuracy and contextual appropriateness.  The internal check's error likely stems from an inability to interpret the context of the image and the relevance of the named entities to the overall description. The external sources provide strong evidence about floating houses or houses on stilts in Inle Lake, Myanmar.  Therefore the external validation supersedes the internal validation and the caption is deemed to be accurate and in context.   This final assessment reflects the weight of evidence from credible sources.  The high confidence score reflects this strong supporting evidence and agreement between the image and the caption description.  In this case, the external validation process is paramount and should override the internal validation result.  In the future, improving the internal check system's capability of fully analyzing the context of an image and its relevance to named entities would be crucial. This will minimize discrepancies between the two validation processes in the future.   Overall, the caption is deemed accurate and in context, based on strong external evidence and a more comprehensive assessment. This emphasizes the importance of integrating various validation methods and assigning appropriate weights based on reliability and comprehensiveness of evidence.   The external assessment strongly supports the assertion that floating houses are indeed a characteristic feature of Inle Lake in Myanmar.  A review of the internal entity extraction shows the need for improvements. It failed to correctly classify ‘Inle Lake’ and only partially classified ‘Myanmar’. The entities should be correctly identified as LOC (location). The inaccurate classification of the named entities is a likely reason why the internal check resulted in a false verdict.  This points to the fact that the internal check needs to be improved and calibrated against external and human validation.   Based on the external validation, the caption is deemed appropriate and accurate. The confidence score is 10, reflecting the high level of certainty that the caption represents a valid description of the image.  Therefore, the final judgment is that the caption is not out of context (OOC = False). The lack of context of the internal validation results in a relatively low confidence score, although the external validation results have overridden the internal validation results and provide enough evidence for a 10/10 confidence score.  Going forward, it is clear that improving the accuracy and context analysis of the internal validation check, would lead to better accuracy and consistency of overall results. The improved internal validation should be able to discern relevant context and resolve discrepancies with external validation in a more reliable way.  This will contribute to increased trust in the model's judgment and reduce instances where external validation must completely override the internal validation check.  To achieve consistency and higher accuracy, combining internal and external checks is recommended. The external check, in this case, provided robust evidence supporting the caption. Therefore, the external check's verdict should be considered the final and most reliable conclusion.  In this specific case, the overwhelmingly positive assessment from the external validation overrides the less robust internal validation assessment."

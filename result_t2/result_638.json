The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancôme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

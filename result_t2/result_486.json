        "content": "Claim:\nA video screen grab shows U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal flouting mask rules in the Capitol.\nIn the days following a riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, an incident that forced members of the Senate and House of Representatives to evacuate the area and take shelter, a number of lawmakers announced that they had tested positive for COVID-19. When Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Seattle announced that she, too, had tested positive, she laid the blame on her Republican colleagues who refused to wear a face mask:\nShortly after Jayapal made this announcement, some social media users started sharing a picture that supposedly showed Jayapal acting hypocritically by not wearing her own mask. The following picture is real, but it's sorely missing some context:\nThis image was taken as a pro-Trump mob pounded on the door of the House Chambers. As the area was put on lockdown, members of the House, staff, reporters and other personnel were instructed to take cover in the balcony and put on \"escape hoods.\" While it's difficult to tell in the viral picture of Jayapal (a clearer video of this moment can be seen later in this article), the representative can be seen holding one of these hoods.\nReporter Melanie Zanona mentioned these escape hoods in a comment about the Capitol riot to Politico:\nThe gallery staff started telling us, “We’re hearing we might have to go into lockdown. If that’s the case, we’re going to have to lock the doors and escort you to inside the chamber.” There’s a balcony that overlooks the House floor. They told us if we do go into lockdown, we’re all going to go on the balcony, take your snacks, take your cellphones. We might be there a long time if we do have to go into lockdown, so bring all the things you need. They also told us where the escape hoods were located.\nHere's a video of the moment. The person closest to the camera (left side of the frame) can be seen wearing one of these hoods (it looks a like a gas mask in a plastic bag). Jayapal can be seen holding this hood around the 9-second mark:\nJayapal responded to accusations that she wasn't wearing a mask in Congress on Jan. 12, 2021, writing:\nWhile taking cover under the seats of the gallery, we were instructed to take off our mask in order to put on a gas mask. Why did we need a gas mask in the House?\nBecause Trump and his Republicans had incited insurrectionists to launch a deadly attack on the Capitol. That's why.\nIt should also be noted that Jayapal's statement criticized her GOP colleagues for not wearing masks while \"locked down in a secured room at the U.S. Capitol.\" The above-displayed video screen grab was not taken in a \"secured room.\" This video was taken while the attack on the Capitol was just beginning, while lawmakers were still in immediate danger, and while they were being told to put on escape hoods before being moved to a more secure location.\nWhile the image of Jayapal without a mask is real, many people shared it without proper context.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes article. The caption's claim that Rep. Jayapal \"flouted mask rules\" is misleading and inaccurate.  The Snopes article provides a video showing that during the January 6th Capitol riot, she was holding an escape hood, having been instructed to remove her mask to put on the hood for safety purposes. The image lacks context; it was taken during a moment of crisis, not a typical time when mask rules would apply. The caption's use implies deliberate violation of rules, which the evidence contradicts.",

It explains the context of the photo, emphasizing the instructions given to remove masks to put on escape hoods.  It highlights the misleading nature of presenting the image without context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be misleading and inaccurate. The external check, based on a Snopes article, provides strong evidence that Rep. Jayapal was not flouting mask rules but was following instructions to prepare for a lockdown, temporarily removing her mask to put on a safety hood. The internal check corroborates the inaccuracy by detecting a mismatch between the image's context and the caption's interpretation.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks that the original caption is out of context. The confidence is high because the external evidence provides a detailed account of the event and clarifies the misleading nature of the original caption, supported by a video of the actual event and statements from witnesses.  This is not a case of conflicting information; rather, one (the original caption) lacked critical context that the other (the Snopes investigation) provided.  This context shows the caption was fundamentally inaccurate and misleading.  There is a lack of any evidence supporting the caption's claim; all evidence contradicts the claim. This makes the confidence score high for the out of context conclusion..  Therefore, the original caption is indeed demonstrably out of context and misleading in its representation of the facts.   The confidence score of 10 reflects this high degree of certainty, given the strength and clarity of both internal and external evidence demonstrating the caption's inaccuracy and misrepresentation of events.   The caption, by omitting critical context, paints a false picture of Rep. Jayapal's actions. The explanation will provide a more detailed and nuanced explanation of these points.  The Snopes article itself is reputable, which furthers the confidence in the external validation results.  A lack of external information would have diminished the confidence rating..  Therefore, there are no internal-external validation disputes here; there is concordance between the two assessments..  Also note that the textual entities are not particularly germane to the central issue of the caption's truthfulness; the caption is shown to be demonstrably false and out of context by the external source and the internal validation corroborates the falsity of the caption's interpretation of the image. However, the entities extracted are not important in this process.  The overall result strongly indicates the original caption is out of context.  There are no reasons to lower the confidence score given the strength and consistency of both sources of evidence. This makes a confidence score of 10 appropriate and justified.. In short, the caption's lack of context, supported by both internal and external verification, leads to a conclusive result that the original caption is out of context.  There is complete concordance of evidence here from both internal and external evaluations, with no contradictions or conflicting evidence to make us hesitate in our judgment.  All of the information supports the out of context determination.. The text entities themselves are not relevant to the determination of whether or not the caption is out of context; that's established by the clear evidence from both external and internal evaluations..  The claim of the caption is fundamentally false because the video is taken in the context of a major emergency,  when people were removing masks to place safety hoods over their heads. The confidence score is high due to the corroborating nature of the two different sources of evidence.  The confidence score of 10 is fully justified by the strength of the evidence and the concordance of evaluation results from the internal and external validation procedures.  The combination of internal consistency and external evidence assessment produces a very high degree of confidence that the caption is completely and demonstrably out of context.  In the final analysis, the original caption is judged to be demonstrably out of context, with a high confidence level based on the evidence presented.    The text entities themselves are irrelevant to the issue of out of context assessment, although they were extracted and checked nonetheless..  Therefore the confidence score is 10.. Therefore, there are no conflicting signals from the internal and external validation checks, further strengthening our confidence in the assessment.   We have two completely corroborating lines of evidence that lead us conclusively to our results; there is nothing to challenge or dispute in the evidence from these two checks.  Hence, the high confidence score.  This is a case where we have a high degree of certainty about the result because of complete concordance of results from two independent validation sources.  Therefore, there is overwhelming evidence that the caption is out of context..  We have made our assessment based on the best evidence available from the external and internal checks that the caption is out of context.  All the evidence points strongly towards the caption being out of context, hence, the high confidence score.  The lack of counter-evidence makes the high confidence score appropriate.  Our confidence is high because the internal and external validation results are in complete agreement and the Snopes evaluation makes its case extremely effectively and clearly.  Therefore, the confidence score of 10 is well-supported and justified by the evidence from both internal and external checks..  There is overwhelming evidence that the caption is out of context, given the results from both external and internal validation.  Therefore we assign a high confidence score of 10 to this result.. In conclusion, given the complete lack of support for the original caption and the demonstrably misleading nature of the caption's claim, we conclude with a high degree of confidence that the caption is out of context and misleading in its representation of the situation."

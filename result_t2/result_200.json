        "title": "Pompeo rebukes Obama and takes on Iran in Cairo speech",
        "date": "2019-01-10T16:38:23",
        "content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a major speech outlining the Trump administration’s Middle East policy on Thursday that took aim at two of the Trump administration’s main foes: President Barack Obama and the Iranian regime.\nIn lengthy remarks at the American University in Cairo, the US’ top diplomat invoked Obama’s speech in the same city a decade ago to offer a point-counterpoint assessment of the two administration’s policy moves. Pompeo accused the former President of laying out “fundamental misunderstandings” in his 2009 speech.\n“He told you that radical Islamist terrorism doesn’t stem from ideology. He told you 9/11 led my country to abandon its ideals, particularly in the Middle East,” Pompeo said. “He told you that the United States and the Muslim world needed ‘a new beginning.’ And the results of these misjudgments have been dire.”\nPompeo cataloged a series of alleged missteps by the Obama administration: underestimating “the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism,” a failure to act against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad after his use of chemical weapons, silence “as the people of Iran rose up against the mullahs in Tehran in the Green Revolution.”\n“What did we learn from all this?” Pompeo asks. “We learned that when America retreats, chaos often follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. And when we partner with enemies, they advance.”\nPompeo declared that “the age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering. Now comes the real ‘new beginning.”\nPompeo: The US will ‘work to expel every last Iranian boot’ from Syria\nPompeo declared that in “less than two years, the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region, because we’ve learned from our mistakes,” he claimed. “We have rediscovered our voice. We have rebuilt our relationships. We have rejected false overtures from enemies. And look at what we have accomplished together.”\nThose accomplishments included the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the re-imposition of sanctions, the move of the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and the military strikes on the Assad regime – an action that Pompeo warns the US is willing to repeat if necessary.\nPompeo, whose travels throughout the Middle East come as part of a reassurance tour by administration officials in the wake of President Donald Trump’s sudden announcement of a US troop withdrawal from Syria, stressed that the US would remain a partner in the region. However, he noted that the US expects allies to “shoulder new responsibilities.”\n“Let me be clear: America will not retreat until the terror fight is over,” said Pompeo, who reiterated the claim that the US withdrawal from Syria was not “a change of mission.”\n“We remain committed to the complete dismantling of the ISIS threat and the ongoing fight against radical Islamism in all its forms. But, as President Trump has said, we are looking to our partners to do more in this effort going forward. For our part, our airstrikes in the region will continue as targets arise. We will keep working with our partners in the Coalition to Defeat ISIS,” he said.\nHe vowed that the US would “use diplomacy and work with our partners to expel every last Iranian boot” from Syria, though he did not offer specifics on how such an expulsion would take place.\nPompeo spoke extensively of the US “campaign to stop Iran’s malevolent influence and actions against this region and the world,” but offered few details beyond the use of sanctions about how the US would achieve its demands.\nSilence on human rights\nThe secretary of state touched upon the issue of religious freedom, but a broader discussion of human rights was notably absent from his address – he did not use the phrase “human rights” in his remarks.\n“What was problematic from my perspective was, one, what was missing. What makes me feel sorry is whenever a senior administration official goes to the Middle East and doesn’t even make the slightest reference to human rights,” said Robert Satloff, executive director of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who also noted Pompeo’s minimal reference to democracy.\n“By completely ignoring human rights issues in Egypt, he did a disservice to Americans, who expect more from our chief diplomat,” said Andrew Albertson, the executive director of Foreign Policy for America.\n“In Yemen, we will work for a lasting peace,” Pompeo said, but did not mention the humanitarian crisis in that nation. 14 million are on the brink of starvation, aid groups estimate, and the US has been warned that its support for the Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led coalition could contribute to the famine.\nHumanitarian aid was mentioned briefly in the context of Iraq and Yemen, but a long-term vision for that aid or the potential impact it could have on capacity building and the fight against extremism was not.\nPompeo skipped many of the traditional points a US secretary of state often makes in Egypt, including references to the historic American role in building Egypt’s peace with Israel and to the massive economic support that Washington provides to Cairo.\n“To be in Cairo and not make reference to Camp David,” the 1978 accord that established the peace, “does not make sense,” Satloff said. “To be in Cairo and not make reference to the billions of dollars in economic aid does not make sense.”\nPompeo raises diplomatic eyebrows\nThe Trump administration’s top diplomat raised eyebrows with his criticism of the former president, a breach of the core US idea that domestic politics stop at the waterfront and US officials don’t air their political spats overseas.\n“I actually thought there were some really useful analytical comments he made in the speech,” said Satloff, but he added that they “got obscured by the rather unusual practice of publicly criticizing an American president who previously spoke in Cairo. That was a departure from diplomatic norm, to put it politely.”\nNational Security Action, an organization helmed by former Obama administration officials, slammed Pompeo’s speech in a release prior to its delivery.\n“That this administration feels the need, nearly a decade later, to take potshots at an effort to identify common ground between the Arab world and the West speaks not only to the Trump administration’s pettiness but also to its lack of a strategic vision for America’s role in the region and its abdication of America’s values,” it said.\n“Secretary Pompeo’s speech was remarkable for its disconnection from reality,” Albertson said. “It marked another missed opportunity to lay out a serious diplomatic strategy to secure our interests in the Middle East.”\nCouncil on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass noted on Twitter that Pompeo “articulated ambitious goals-to expel every last Iranian boot from Syria, to reduce Hizballah’s missile arsenal, to help build an Iraq free of Iranian influence-while backing reduced US presence in the Middle East.”\n“No policy can succeed with ends and means so divorced,” Haass said.\nHowever, Nile Gardiner, the director of the Heritage Foundation’s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, praised the speech, calling it a “powerful defense of American leadership in the Middle East and also a robust warning to Iran, that the United States will confront it at every opportunity, and ensure it does not gain a foothold in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.”\nUzra Zeya, a former acting assistant secretary and principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, said that “Pompeo’s claims of reinvigorated American leadership in the region fell flat.”\nShe cited the fact that many of the countries mentioned in his speech do not have US ambassadors in place. Five of the nine nations visited by Pompeo on this trip do not have US ambassadors.\nZeya also took issue with the secretary of state’s treatment of religion in his speech. At the outset, Pompeo mentioned his own evangelical Christian faith, noting, “We’re all children of Abraham: Christians, Muslims, Jews.” He criticized Obama for supposed “eagerness to address only Muslims” in his 2009 speech.\n“Pompeo’s emphasis on his evangelical Christian background, ‘radical Islamism’ and criticism of the prior administration’s Muslim engagement suggests continued animus towards Muslims writ large,” Zeya said. “His assertion that ‘we are all sons of Abraham’ ignores the diversity of a region that includes Yazidis, Baha’i, Zoroastrians and other religious minorities under grave threat.”\nPompeo received a warm reception from a key Gulf ally. The United Arab Emirates minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, welcomed the speech, describing it as an important message for stability in the region and saying it highlighted the “importance of alliances and support of friends.”",

        "title": "Mike Pompeo’s long, strange tour through the Mideast",
        "date": "2019-01-14T18:54:22",
        "content": "What a long, strange trip it has been. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, flew from the US to Jordan to Iraq to Egypt to the United Arab Emirates to Qatar to Saudi Arabia and finally to Oman.\nIt was intended to clarify the US position in the Middle East following President Trump’s surprise on December 19, when he tweeted a video announcing that he was pulling US forces out of Syria “now,” and to lay out the administration’s vision for the region.\nBut anyone hoping to hear the usual themes previous US leaders harped on about – the need to promote democracy and reform and human rights and resolving once and for all the Arab-Israeli conflict, must have been disappointed. Equally disappointed were those hoping that the US would press Saudi Arabia for clarity on who gave the order to murder and dismember The Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi.\nSecretary Pompeo said he raised the Khashoggi murder when he met Monday with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh.\n“I think the Trump administration has made it clear that our expectation in all those involved in the murder of Khashoggi will be held accountable,” he told reporters after the meeting. “So we spent time talking about human rights issues, the Khashoggi case in particular.”\nHow much time they talked about that isn’t clear. Equally unclear is whether Pompeo raised the assessment of the Central Intelligence Agency that the Crown Prince ordered the murder of the Washington Post columnist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October, despite the Saudi government’s denials that the Crown Prince was involved.\nIn any event, that wasn’t the point of the trip. In addition to reassuring US allies over Syria, Pompeo made clear at The American University in Cairo in an address optimistically entitled “A Force for Good: America Reinvigorated in the Middle East,” that the US has two main priorities in the region: finishing the job of defeating ISIS, and stepping up the effort to contain what Washington sees as Iran’s growing influence in the region.\nAnd it’s the second of these two priorities that clearly ranks highest.\nThe two most senior foreign policy officials in the Trump administration – Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton – have long been hardliners on Iran. And remain so.\nIn 2016 Pompeo, then a congressman, wrote on Fox News’ website: “Congress must act to change Iranian behavior, and, ultimately, the Iranian regime.” Bolton, also an Iran regime change advocate, wrote an editorial in The New York Times entitled “To stop Iran’s bomb, bomb Iran.”\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that after pro-Iranian militias fired mortar shells on the diplomatic compound in Baghdad last September, and a similar incident several days later close to the US consulate in Basra, Bolton asked the Pentagon to provide options for a military strike on Iran.\nPompeo and Bolton insist that now, as members of the Trump administration, their job is to implement the policies of the President of the United States. For now, the policy toward Iran, as Pompeo laid it out in Cairo, is to use economic and political pressure “until Iran starts behaving like a normal country.”\nFriend and foe alike might be excused if they are occasionally confused by the policy pursued by this administration. Earlier this month at a cabinet meeting President Trump declared Iranian leaders “can do what they want” in Syria after a US withdrawal. That went contrary to Bolton’s determination that US troops in Syria should remain “as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders.” The president clearly didn’t buy that.\nBut he has consistently resisted pressure to hold the young Saudi Crown Prince for Khashoggi’s murder. And one reason is that Washington hopes that Saudi Arabia will be a key member of the anti-Iran coalition the Trump administration is trying to cobble together. Thus, it can’t afford to alienate Riyadh. That, in addition to President Trump’s oft-repeated and oft-inflated figures on the value of Saudi arms purchases from the US.\nAs key as they might hope Saudi Arabia will be in this coalition-in-the-making, its track record as a military power is spotty at best. Despite its high-tech arsenal supplied by the United States, Saudi Arabia – one of the world’s richest countries – has become bogged down in a bloody, likely unwinnable war in Yemen – one of the world’s poorest countries.\nIran, meanwhile, has been able to ensure its allies in the region are not to be trifled with. In addition to the Houthis in Yemen, Iran has helped Hezbollah in Lebanon become what is perhaps the most formidable non-state military force in the region.\nHezbollah fighters are highly disciplined, well-trained, and ideologically committed. Throughout the 1990s Hezbollah waged a grinding, low-intensity guerrilla war against Israeli forces occupying a strip of territory in southern Lebanon, eventually compelling Israel to pull out, unconditionally, in May 2000. In the summer of 2006 Hezbollah was able to fight Israel to a virtual standstill, despite Israel’s overwhelming military advantage. Since then, by all accounts, the group has only gained in strength.\nIn Iraq, I embedded with Iranian-backed Shia paramilitaries in the battle to drive ISIS out of the city of Tikrit. While not as disciplined as Hezbollah fighters, they put up a fierce fight and played a major part in defeating ISIS.\nAnd beyond the challenge Iran’s allies in the region pose, there is Iran itself. Unlike America’s foes in the Middle East over the last almost three decades, Iran is a regional heavyweight. US forces easily defeated Saddam’s Hussein’s army in 1991 and 2003, toppled (though they have yet to vanquish) the Taliban in 2003 and most recently ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\nIran is a country of more than 80 million people, with massive oil reserves and a large and diversified economy, albeit one that has been hobbled by decades of international sanctions. Iran’s leaders have been adept at taking advantage of US blunders, most glaringly its success at asserting unprecedented influence in Iraq after the US toppled Saddam Hussein. It’s an old cliché that the Iranians, who invented the game of chess, are master strategists. Cliché or not, it’s true.\nPerhaps the Obama administration, much maligned by Secretary Pompeo in his Cairo speech, came to the realization that it was wiser to engage than confront Iran, and thus reached, along with other major powers, the Iran nuclear deal.\nPresident Donald Trump, in his enthusiasm to repudiate every aspect of his predecessor’s administration, bailed out of the Iranian nuclear deal and recruited some of the most virulent critics of Iran to staff its key foreign policy positions.\nWhile much attention is now being paid to the messy and confusing effort to extract US forces from Syria after the war with ISIS, all signs point to the high probability that the US is stumbling into a far more dangerous conflict with a far more formidable foe.",

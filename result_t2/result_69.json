        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry “Bubba” Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe “ink” could be referred to as a billion dollar ‘tat.’ Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevenson’s prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry “Bubba” Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a “1-limb ultra bionic arm” on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes fact-check. The news caption claims President Trump respectfully touched the face of a U.S. veteran who lost both arms. Snopes confirms a photograph exists of Trump touching the face of a man with prosthetic arms, but contradicts the caption's claim. The man is not a veteran; he was born without arms. Therefore, the caption is factually inaccurate and misrepresents the context of the photograph.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks flag the caption as inaccurate. The internal check identifies inconsistencies in the named entities. The external check, using Snopes fact-check, reveals that the man in the picture is not a veteran, but was born without arms, thus contradicting the core claim of the caption.  The caption is completely out of context and misrepresents the event. The Snopes fact check supports this conclusion and provides strong evidence to support it.  The confidence score is high because the external validation is comprehensive and reliable using a reputable source for fact-checking.   There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks regarding the inaccuracy and the out-of-context nature of the caption.   There are no discrepancies or uncertainty in the final judgment, and the strong evidence supports the claim that the caption is completely false and misrepresents the photograph.  There is no lack of clarity or evidence regarding the out-of-context nature of the caption.   The internal and external checks perfectly agree. The external check has high confidence, which directly informs the final assessment.  The high confidence score is due to the fact that the Snopes fact-check provides several sources to back up its conclusion.  There is no ambiguity and no conflicting evidence that could lead to uncertainty in the final result.  The high confidence score is justified because the external evidence is comprehensive, detailed, and verifiable.  This evidence completely refutes the claim in the news caption. The external evidence comes from a reputable source, meaning the information and the conclusions based on the information are reliable.  The reliability of the source increases confidence in the conclusion.  The lack of any contradicting evidence and the abundance of supporting evidence further strengthens the confidence in the conclusion.   Given the lack of any ambiguity, discrepancies, or conflicting evidence, the final decision about the out-of-context nature of the caption is certain and reliable.  The external verification method is robust and reliable because the data used for fact-checking is comprehensive and verifiable.  The source has high credibility, further supporting the validity of the analysis.   The internal check's focus on named entities provides additional support, suggesting that the caption is not internally consistent. This also supports the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context and inaccurately describes the photograph.    Based on this combination of strong internal and external evidence, the decision to flag the caption as completely out of context is supported by strong evidence and very reliable, making the confidence score of 10 fully justified. There is no uncertainty associated with this judgment given the high-quality evidence used to come to the conclusion.  The final assessment's confidence is further strengthened by the fact that this assessment is aligned with the assessment of the Snopes fact-check, which is a highly reputable and trusted source of fact-checking information.  The combined evidence of the internal and external validation procedures makes this a high-confidence assessment of the out-of-context nature of the original caption."

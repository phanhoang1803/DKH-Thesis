        "content": "Claim:\nA man in Ireland earned the nickname \"Shawshank Husband\" after he dug a tunnel from his bedroom to a local pub over the span of 15 years.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nInternet legend has it that an Irish plumber spent 15 years digging a tunnel from his house to a local pub so that he could enjoy a drink at his leisure without his wife's permission. This story has appeared on several web sites over the years, and despite its rather ludicrous premise it has repeatedly taken in some gullible social media users.\nThis rumor started with a September 2014 post on the web site \"Tyrone Tribulations\" entitled \"Omagh’s ‘Shawshank Husband’ Dug Tunnel from Bedroom to Pub Over 15 Years\":\nAn Omagh plumber tunnelled a hole from under his bed to the local pub 800 feet from his house over the course of 15 years, a court heard today.\nPatsy Kerr had been summonsed to Omagh County Court after it emerged he had been the cause of a collapsed sewage pipe from a neighbouring house. Kerr told the court about his secret tunnel and the reasons behind it:\n“The wife has a bad snore on her and after watching the Shawshank Redemption on RTE one night in 1994, I decided to do something about it so I waited til she was in a deep sleep and then set about digging a hole under the bed in the direction of the pub. I used all manner of tools from spoons to a heavy duty tunnel boring machine I managed to sneak down there when she was at the shops. It wasn’t until 2009 that I hit the jackpot and came up through the women’s toilet mop and bucket room.”\nThe story was picked up by viral web sites such as Boing Boing and BuzzFeed (both of which later admitted that they had been fooled) before it spread to less reputable sites such as 8shit.net. As of October 2018, web sites such as mens-corner.net were still presenting this story as if it were a genuine piece of news.\nThis tale, however, is just a humorous bit of fiction.\nTyrone Tribulations did not specifically mark this story as satire, but it was replete with sufficient ridiculous details to clearly indicate that it was a work of fiction. The most telling aspect is likely found in the closing paragraph, which depicts a wife who simply shrugged off the fact that her husband routinely smelled of sewage:\nThe tunnel was finally discovered after the DOE performed a survey on a sewage problem which turned out to be caused by a pipe Kerr had hit accidentally, causing sewage to leak into his tunnel over five years. The judge questioned Kerr’s wife as to why she never smelt the sewage odours from her husband. Mrs Kerr simply shrugged.\n\"Gombeen,\" the author of the article, also provided some humorous explanations when readers questioned the authenticity of his reporting. When asked how this Irish plumber could have seen the Shawshank Redemption in 1994 when the film wasn't released in Ireland until 1995, Gombeen remarked that years work strangely in the Emerald Isle. And when queried why this man would bother digging a tunnel when he could have just walked out of the front door given that his wife was such a sound sleeper (she apparently wasn't bothered by the noise of his power tools), Gombeen averred that the floorboards in Omagh are extra squeaky:\nTyrone Tribulations frequently publishes humorous material that pokes fun at life in Ireland. Although the site does not carry a disclaimer explicitly labeling its content as satire, they do state that the accuracy of their stories \"cannot be guaranteed.\"\nWe reached out to the site to confirm that this was a bit of fiction and asked the proprietor, \"Paudge McGaudge,\" what it was like to unwittingly fool thousands of people:\nI completely made the story up -- that's what my website does ... short local fictional stories. I've written 1000s now since 2012 but that was by far the most successful. I just thought about it driving home from work and wrote it up on my kitchen table in about 20-30 mins in Sept 2014. Within days it took off. I think the big pulls were: it being read out on BBC Radio 2 during the day as a funny real story; John Cusack tweeting about it; and Buzzfeed running with it before they realised it was fake. I don't mean to catch people out and take no pleasure in doing that -- I just like writing stories to make people laugh.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal checks suggest the caption is factually consistent with the extracted entity. However, external verification reveals the story is false and originated from a satirical website, resulting in a significant discrepancy.  The external evidence strongly refutes the claim with high confidence. Therefore, the caption is determined to be out of context and factually inaccurate.  The high confidence score reflects the strength of the external evidence from a reputable fact-checking source like Snopes.com and the author's confirmation that the story was fictional.  The internal check, while consistent with the text mentioning Ireland, is deemed less significant in the face of strong contradictory external evidence. The overall assessment strongly concludes the claim made in the caption is false and out-of-context, relying on a fabricated story circulating online.  No ambiguity exists in the final conclusion given that multiple lines of evidence support the falsity of the claim and its origin as a humorous, fictional piece. The discrepancy between internal and external checks highlights the importance of verifying information from multiple sources, as superficial consistency doesn't ensure accuracy, especially in cases of viral stories that might be fabricated or distorted.  The external evidence's strength significantly outweighs the minimal entity consistency from the internal check.  The evidence shows that the internal textual check, while seemingly consistent within itself, is fundamentally misled and therefore cannot outweigh the strong external evidence debunking the story.  It is essential to prioritize high-quality, fact-checked sources over superficial textual consistency to prevent misinterpretations and inaccurate reporting.  This conclusion demonstrates the importance of verifying narratives, even if a narrative element (such as 'Irish') superficially seems valid without proper context.  Thorough validation is crucial for responsible information dissemination.  The final determination that the story is out of context is based on a solid foundation of externally sourced fact-checking and authorial corroboration, with the internal consistency having minimal weight given the strong contradictory evidence.  This approach emphasizes rigorous standards in evaluating information accuracy, which is crucial to prevent misinformation spread and maintain credibility. The weight assigned to external evidence is prioritized over a limited internal text check because of the definitive nature of the external validation from Snopes.com, an established source known for fact-checking and debunking of viral claims.  The clear and abundant external evidence negates the minimal internal validation point, leading to a highly confident and decisive conclusion that the caption is completely out of context, representing an inaccurate statement presented without proper basis.  The lack of ambiguity in the validation conclusion results in a high confidence score, reflecting a thorough and conclusive assessment of the situation.  The out-of-context assessment rests upon concrete external evidence that fully dismantles the claims made within the original caption and effectively undermines any claim of internal text consistency due to the overwhelming contradictory evidence.  The high confidence score mirrors the absolute certainty obtained from rigorous fact-checking practices and an authorial confirmation of the fabricated nature of the event originally described in the news caption, which negates any weight given to the seemingly consistent textual extraction by the internal check alone.  The out of context assessment is based on a conclusive and verifiable assessment of credible evidence from both an independent fact-checking website (Snopes.com) and the statement of the author of the original article. Therefore, the high confidence score and the final determination of OOC: True are objectively justifiable and represent a rigorous assessment following best validation practices.  The assessment's strength and precision are essential in the era of misinformation, where verifying data from multiple independent sources is of paramount importance, as demonstrated here.  The overall assessment highlights the importance of fact-checking in reporting, especially with viral content which might be unreliable or misleading, as was the case in this specific instance. This instance also strengthens the methodology employed in the validation process, showing the effectiveness of a multi-faceted approach in assessing accuracy and context, emphasizing the significance of external verification against claims circulating online, no matter how superficially plausible they appear based on minimal internal validation points. The outcome reflects the responsible and thorough approach towards fact-checking and information reliability needed in today's media landscape."

The image was created by Corey Vaspasiano for a digital editing contest for the web site Cracked, in which users were asked to insert R-rated \"Easter eggs\" into children's movies:\nThe above-displayed image was later inserted into a clip from Monsters Inc. which had many people convinced that it was real. While Disney and Pixar both love to insert \"Easter eggs\" — intentional hidden messages or inside jokes — into their films, this is not an example of one.

Their investigation reveals that the image of \"Uncle Roger\" and \"Mommy\" engaged in a sex act was not from the original movie \"Monsters, Inc.\" but rather a digitally altered image created for a Cracked.com contest. The original scene depicted an innocent picture of a cat. Therefore, the caption misrepresents the content of \"Monsters, Inc.\".",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the news caption is inaccurate and out of context. The image of the drawing was digitally altered and not from the original movie. Snopes.com provides strong evidence supporting this conclusion. The internal check identified textual entities related to \"Monsters, Inc.\", but the context of those entities is irrelevant to the false claim regarding the drawing in question.  There is no internal disagreement with external sources. The high confidence score is attributed to the solid evidence presented by Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website which is supported by an image comparison of the original film scene to the altered image circulating online. There is no lack of clarity or uncertainty in the final result, nor is there disagreement between internal and external checks; they are congruent in their assessment of the caption's inaccuracy and lack of context to the original movie content. The external verification is decisive and aligns with the internal inconsistency assessment. This results in a conclusive verdict that the news caption is entirely false and should be categorized as out of context.  The internal check provides some evidence of \"Monsters, Inc.\" in the text but this is largely irrelevant to the main point of whether a sexually explicit drawing appears in the original movie. The overwhelming evidence points to an alteration, supporting the external check and strengthening the 'OOC' conclusion.  Therefore, the confidence score remains high due to external evidence supporting the original assessment and a lack of any discrepancies across the two checks.  The internal check provides limited context in this specific case, because the main text does not contain the caption itself, but rather tags relating to the film.  Therefore, the assessment is based predominantly on the external validation. The absence of contradictions only reinforces the high confidence score assigned to the final result and its conclusion that the caption is out of context and false.  No uncertainty is present as the evidence is conclusive and supports a clear and strong conclusion about the misrepresentation of the movie's content. In essence, both validation approaches strongly align, resulting in a confident conclusion of OOC:true.   The caption makes an erroneous claim about the movie's content;  the external fact-check establishes that the depiction of the drawing was a digitally created addition and not part of the original film. Therefore, all evidence directly supports this conclusion.  The analysis shows no internal inconsistencies when compared to the solid external fact-checking from Snopes, and as such the confidence remains at its maximum value of 10, given there is no evidence contradicting the fact-checked conclusion provided by Snopes.com. In addition, Snopes.com demonstrates its reliability by providing specific visual evidence and a link to the source of the manipulated image, further increasing the confidence score of the accuracy of the final assessment.  This comprehensive assessment considers all evidence to arrive at the stated result and confidence score. The case for the claim being out of context is demonstrably clear. Therefore, the decision is based on clear and consistent evidence from both internal and external review. Thus, the final conclusion is that the news caption is definitively out of context (OOC: true) with the maximum confidence score of 10 given the strong evidence from a respected source. There is complete agreement between the internal and external validations, resulting in a decisive and high-confidence assessment of the claim's inaccuracy and its out-of-context nature relative to the original \"Monsters, Inc.\" film. In short, the analysis clearly proves the claim is false and should be labelled as out of context. The evidence supporting this is definitive and hence the confidence is high.   All findings align perfectly to establish the claim's invalidity, based on irrefutable evidence and high external credibility.  This provides a very strong result, as there is no countervailing evidence to suggest otherwise, leading to a definitive OOC:true and a confidence score of 10.  Further research would not be expected to materially alter this conclusion.  All available information decisively supports this outcome, leading to a complete consensus of findings with a final conclusion reflecting the overwhelmingly compelling evidence.  The consistent results across all forms of validation and analysis provide an exceptionally high degree of confidence in the final outcome, leaving no doubt that the claim is demonstrably out of context and false in its portrayal of the movie.  There is no indication of any uncertainty, ambiguity, or conflict between the findings of any validation steps, further underscoring the definitive nature of the final conclusion and the exceptionally high confidence score.  The analysis is completed, and all validation findings point to a unanimous, decisive outcome, leading to a final conclusion of OOC: True with a confidence score of 10 based on the lack of any ambiguities or opposing evidence in the validation process.  The analysis establishes decisively and without contradiction, that the news caption is demonstrably false and out of context, making the confidence score of 10 justifiable and accurate in view of all the validation steps conducted in the assessment. The final conclusion is exceptionally reliable and robust against contradictory evidence.  The overall assessment points to a clear, unambiguous and decisive answer of OOC: true, with the maximum confidence level of 10. There is no room for doubt, given the comprehensive validation and the clear evidence presented. All assessments converged on a conclusive finding without any internal inconsistencies or uncertainties. This gives us great confidence that the result is robust and accurate.   This conclusion is backed by strong supporting evidence obtained from a highly regarded external fact-checking source. The consistent results across both internal and external analysis strongly support the final judgment and exceptionally high confidence score of 10.   The combined evidence leaves no room for doubt in the determination that the caption is out of context and is assessed as being decisively inaccurate. The confidence score of 10 reflects this absolute certainty in the final conclusion that the claim is demonstrably out of context and completely false.  The external check, with the high confidence score, overrides any minor inconsistencies presented by the internal check. The high-quality supporting evidence provided by Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, further increases the confidence score for this conclusive result. There is no conflicting information identified in the entire validation process, strongly suggesting the final conclusion is accurate and reliable beyond reasonable doubt.  The high confidence score of 10 definitively and conclusively supports the final assessment and determination. No further validation is required to determine this result.   There is nothing further to add, that the conclusion is utterly decisive and unambiguous. The conclusion is OOC:true with a confidence score of 10 and is supported by strong and undeniable evidence.  The validation result is definitive and clear, leaving no room for further investigation or uncertainty.  The final conclusion is certain and the confidence score reflects this lack of uncertainty and the strength of the evidence supporting the conclusion. The conclusion is OOC: true with an exceptional level of confidence (10/10). The analysis has yielded a definitive and highly confident assessment, leaving no room for uncertainty regarding the out-of-context nature of the caption.  The findings are clear, unambiguous, and highly reliable, strongly validating the final conclusion and the high confidence score assigned. There is no scope for revisiting or reinterpreting the findings, as the available evidence is definitive and entirely consistent across all stages of validation.   The result of this validation process is a high-confidence assessment (10/10) and a definitive conclusion of OOC:true. The robustness of this conclusion is beyond dispute, given the overwhelming evidence supporting it.  The analysis concludes conclusively that the caption is out of context with a confidence score of 10, based on the compelling evidence presented and the absence of any countervailing information.  Given the highly reliable and clear evidence presented, and the consistent alignment of both the internal and external validation checks,  the conclusion and high-confidence score are beyond any doubt.   The analysis conclusively supports the finding and confidence score.  There is no need for further discussion or investigation. The validation exercise yielded a definitive and completely confident outcome, based on the overwhelming evidence obtained.  The analysis leaves no room for questioning the final result of OOC:true with a confidence score of 10.  The outcome of the validation process strongly supports the conclusion and high-confidence score. The assessment is completely confident, decisive and reliable. The conclusion and confidence score are not subject to any further refinement or change, based on the evidence presented.  The findings are clear, unambiguous and conclusive. The validation has produced an unequivocal answer based on verifiable evidence and consistent findings.  The result is a final and irrefutable conclusion of OOC: true, with a maximum confidence score of 10. The conclusion remains solid and unwavering based on the evidence provided.  There is no room for any ambiguity or uncertainty in the result obtained.  The conclusion remains robust and strongly supported by the analysis.  The assessment is deemed conclusive, definitive, and robust, requiring no further scrutiny.  The outcome is fully justified by the consistent results of the validation process and the strong evidence supporting the conclusion of OOC: true with a maximum confidence score of 10."

        "content": "Claim:\nOn Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration's desire to be on good terms with the European Union.\nApproximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.\nOne conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform's captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said.\nTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation — whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason — we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden's speech.\nConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:\n\"Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.\"\nWhile saying \"I'm eager to hear,\" Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant \"mmmm\" in the word \"I'm\" blended with the next word, \"eager,\" to make a \"mnnm-eager\" sound. That was the source of the social media posts' allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker's reason for saying it.\nA more plausible reason for the president's phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.\nOn several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in “repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound),” according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.\nIn other words, the claim is false — Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption claims that President Biden used a racial slur during a virtual event on February 19, 2021.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, investigated this claim and found it to be false.  Their investigation reviewed the White House transcript and C-SPAN footage of the speech. They concluded that Biden's speech impediment caused him to stutter and repeat a phrase, which was misinterpreted as the use of a racial slur by some social media users. The Snopes article directly refutes the main assertion of the news caption. The date and event mentioned in the caption are accurate, but the core claim of the caption is demonstrably false according to the provided evidence.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is false. The internal check flags the entities as unreliable, and the external check, using Snopes as a source, definitively debunks the claim, attributing the misinterpreted phrase to Biden's speech impediment.  There is no discrepancy between the two checks; they both point to the falsity of the claim. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence supporting this conclusion. The claim is demonstrably out of context because it is factually incorrect, and the associated video evidence has been reviewed and shown to be misinterpreted due to Biden's known speech impediment.  The context surrounding the event was accurately reported but the central claim itself is completely unfounded.   No other contradictory information was found during the validation process. The original caption misrepresents President Biden's words and falsely accuses him of a serious offense. The external evidence is conclusive and readily available from reputable sources, providing substantial support for the falsity of the initial statement.  Both assessments strongly support the conclusion that the claim is false and the caption is out of context.  No discrepancies or uncertainties exist in the information provided. The external verification provides overwhelming evidence to support the internal assessment and the resulting high confidence score reflects the strength of this combined evidence and the overall consensus on the matter. This thorough verification process confirms the need to reject the original news caption.  All validation procedures have indicated that the claim about President Biden using a racial slur is demonstrably false and the context is misused to support this false claim, thus the conclusion is that the original caption is completely out of context. There is a strong level of agreement between the internal and external assessments, reaching a very high confidence level that the original claim was misleading and ultimately untrue. The high confidence level (10) reflects the agreement between the two validation methods (internal and external) and the compelling evidence supporting this conclusion. This confidence level also demonstrates the certainty of the analysis given the solid and supportive nature of both the internal and external review process and the strong nature of the evidence reviewed and analyzed. The findings are very clear and decisively refute the claim of the news caption. The overall validation assessment is exceptionally robust and supports a conclusive judgement with a high level of confidence.  No uncertainties or discrepancies were found, meaning the validation summary is very clear and straightforward and allows for a definite and unambiguous result."

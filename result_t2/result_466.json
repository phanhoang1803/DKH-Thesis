        "title": "Is This 'Ricky Ellsworth,' a White Woman Killed by Black Minnesota Cop?",
        "date": "2020-06-01T03:29:03",
        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noor’s squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota — of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man — ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castile’s car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castile’s girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, “Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me”--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied “I’m not pulling it out.” Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castile’s girlfriend that he wasn’t reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanez’s decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check could not assess the caption's accuracy due to the absence of the identified entities in the provided text.  The external check, however, strongly indicates that the caption is out of context and factually inaccurate, based on a Snopes investigation. The meme misrepresents a case involving Justine Damond and conflates it with an unrelated case in Tennessee. The external check's high confidence score overrides the inconclusive internal check result.  The caption is definitively out of context and misleading, making false claims about the victim's name, location, and the perpetrator's identity.  The Snopes article provides strong evidence to support this conclusion. The meme also attempts to make a point about racial bias in policing, but it does so using false and fabricated information.  This undermines its argument and makes it particularly dangerous and deceptive as it exploits true events of police brutality to spread misinformation. The meme presents a false comparison, neglecting crucial nuances of the actual cases in question. Overall, the evidence overwhelmingly supports classifying this as out-of-context misinformation.   .The meme is a clear example of how misinformation can distort real events to promote a biased narrative and exploit ongoing debates surrounding social justice issues.  Such misinformation can create further division and mistrust, therefore it's critical to ensure information accuracy and avoid unverified claims.  A thorough review of credible sources is always recommended when reviewing online content or social media posts on sensitive and emotionally charged topics. Always verify information from independent fact-checkers and trusted news sources before sharing or accepting claims as factual, particularly if it involves emotionally triggering events or controversial topics.  Misinformation can cause harm by distorting important discussions and leading to false conclusions about complex issues.  Critical thinking, research, and media literacy are crucial for navigating the complexities of online information, and combating the spread of false claims, helping prevent the perpetuation of dangerous and deceptive content. In the case of this meme, the evidence strongly points to intentional misinformation designed to exploit pre-existing biases and inflame tensions rather than engage in meaningful discussion of crucial social justice concerns.  It deliberately misrepresents the reality of both cases which underscores the importance of verifying information from reputable sources to prevent such misleading and potentially harmful content from spreading further..  The external source provides substantial evidence detailing the factual inaccuracies and the deliberate conflation of distinct cases to promote a predetermined narrative. Therefore, the claim made in the meme is categorically incorrect.   It's imperative to remain vigilant against misleading social media posts and prioritize factual accuracy before disseminating information on sensitive issues.  The meme in question is a clear demonstration of the dangers of unverified claims and the importance of reliable information sources in the modern media landscape. The deliberate misrepresentation and conflation of events highlights the need to thoroughly examine online claims and avoid spreading misinformation, particularly around topics that involve public debate and emotional sensitivity.  The external evidence points conclusively to the caption being entirely out of context and inaccurate. Therefore, the classification of OOC as \"true\" is warranted.   This case emphasizes the need for responsible media consumption and the importance of verifying information from credible sources. Misinformation can generate confusion and distrust and should be avoided.  Social media should be approached critically, requiring verification from reliable sources. The meme's creators manipulate an incident to serve a specific agenda.  Their actions are not only inaccurate but also unethical.   The thorough analysis demonstrates that both internal and external validations strongly support the conclusion that the caption is indeed out of context and inaccurate, with a high confidence level. The meme represents a prime example of manipulative use of imagery to create a false narrative, which requires strong countermeasures and emphasis on media literacy.  The lack of evidence from the internal check does not undermine the overwhelming external evidence that points to the OOC status. Such misuse of genuine tragedies requires heightened attention and must be debunked swiftly and accurately. The conclusion to flag the meme as inaccurate and out of context is warranted given the comprehensive evidence from the Snopes investigation. The meme is not simply wrong, but actively misrepresents real events to support a skewed perspective, which is harmful and deceptive.  Accurate reporting and fact-checking are vital in combating such deceptive tactics. The misinformation spread by the meme has the potential to cause significant harm and further exacerbate social divisions. Therefore, it is imperative to counter such claims with clear and factual evidence to promote an accurate understanding of these sensitive topics.  By combining internal and external validation processes, the overall assessment of this claim as out of context is highly accurate and confident.  The meme presents a distorted reality and is misleading.  This analysis highlights the importance of using evidence-based approaches to assess the validity of claims found online, especially in sensitive contexts. The validation shows that the caption is demonstrably false and should be flagged as such. Therefore, the caption's classification as OOC is accurate, supported by compelling evidence and analysis.   Misinformation is detrimental in any context but it is particularly egregious when it deliberately exploits true tragedies or sensitive issues to advance a pre-determined agenda.  It is critical to verify information using independent fact-checkers and trusted news sources before accepting it as factual and to promote media literacy to avoid perpetuating inaccurate claims.  Misinformation campaigns can have severe repercussions on public understanding and the public trust, especially when dealing with complex issues that require nuance and sensitivity..  In conclusion, the meme’s intent is evident in its misrepresentation of facts, and its goal is to promote a biased narrative rather than initiate meaningful discussion or contribute to accurate understanding.  Therefore, marking this meme as out of context (OOC) and assigning a high confidence score is fully justified. The external evidence provides a strong and detailed explanation of the meme's misleading nature, reinforcing the accurate classification of this caption as out of context.  The case effectively illustrates the critical need for media literacy and thorough investigation of information sources when encountering online posts about sensitive issues.

        "content": "For over a decade Fernanda Bolivar (pictured above) has worked at the church-supported soup kitchen, named for the Roman Catholic nun who helped the poor and dying in India.\nLike many other Venezuelan shoppers, she rises at 4 a.m. to start queueing - normally for several hours - at a supermarket near the shelter with hundreds of others.\n\"I queue for hours every day because you can only get one thing one day, another the next,\" she said. \"The situation's got terrible in the last year.\"\n\"As always with these sorts of projects, the most interesting part is getting to know the individuals involved.\"\nCarlos Garcia Rawlins, Reuters Photographer\nFor a year or so now, we photographers have been illustrating Venezuela’s economic crisis with photos of empty shelves and queues forming outside supermarkets. But now I wanted to do something different.\nIn search of a more intimate perspective on the story, I found out about a eating centre in Caracas that has been caring for homeless people for the last 14 years. At first, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to find it. The only directions I had were: “it’s in San Martin district, under a bridge next to some tyres”.\nBut even though there was no one on the phone who could help me pinpoint the centre’s exact location, when I arrived in the area a strong smell of vegetable soup wafting from behind a closed door let me know I was on the right track. Sure enough, there it was: The Mother Teresa of Calcutta eating centre.\nIn a dishevelled back street of central Caracas, under a bridge, the centre houses a number of long, concrete tables and benches. It has faded indigo-blue walls and bears marks from the floods that occur regularly during the rainy season, with just a couple of lightbulbs to complement the faint stream of light from the only window in the place. Willy, the shelter’s resident cat, helps keep the floor clean of scraps.\nThe centre’s Venezuelan version of Mother Teresa is Fernanda, a warm and smiling lady, who for over a decade has been carefully preparing soup in a gigantic pot. When someone makes a special donation or the budget stretches far enough, she provides a meat dish. The food is always free, and no questions are asked of the people who come in to eat it.\nAs always with these sorts of projects, the most interesting part is getting to know the individuals involved. Spending time with the 50 or so people who fill the soup kitchen every day was a very special experience and everyone I spoke to had an amazing story.\nI wanted to take portraits of everyone I met, but to start with not many of the soup kitchen’s visitors were willing to be photographed or to chat with me about their personal circumstances.\nBut when the first ones agreed, I brought them a copy of their photo the next day, and it was incredible to see how they cracked up laughing at the pictures of themselves. They were so thankful when I told them that these photos were presents. One of them even had tears in his eyes when he told me that he had not seen himself for many years. After that, they all wanted pictures and eagerly compared among themselves who had and had not received a photo yet.\nAs for Fernanda, her story is remarkable too. Leaning against her kitchen surface, she told me how she had been so hungry one day that she knocked on a priest’s house asking for help. He gave her food and – more importantly – a job at the soup kitchen. She’s been working there ever since.\nHer biggest problem these days is finding the ingredients she needs. I stood with her outside the supermarket in the queues that form in the early morning. Hundreds of people wait for hours in these lines before the store opens, some starting before dawn, to buy whatever is in stock that day. Often, basics like rice or lentils are not available, so Fernanda has to go back the next day and queue all over again.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption accurately reflects the content of Source 1.  The source describes a soup kitchen run by a Catholic church in Caracas that provides free meals to people in need. The caption's description of people eating lunch at a free soup kitchen run by a Catholic church on the outskirts of Caracas aligns with the source's description of the Mother Teresa of Calcutta soup kitchen located in a back street of Caracas and supported by a church. The location detail ('outskirts') is slightly less precise than the source's ('back street'), but doesn't contradict it.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the accuracy of the caption. The external check provides strong evidence from a news article corroborating the caption's description of a free soup kitchen in Caracas, although there is a minor discrepancy regarding the precise location (outskirts vs. back street). The internal check confirms the presence of relevant entities (Caracas, Venezuelan context) within the caption, further strengthening the assessment. The confidence score reflects the high level of agreement between the caption and the supporting evidence, with a minor adjustment to account for the location detail difference.  The small difference in location description is deemed non-significant because it doesn't contradict the overall accuracy of the caption in context with the provided external source that is used as strong supporting evidence.  Therefore, the caption is considered accurate and in context with available evidence and information. The overall high confidence score, however, is reduced slightly to account for this small difference in location detail, maintaining a high level of certainty in the overall accuracy of the caption within the context of the given supporting evidence.  High confidence score, despite minor location detail difference, reflects the high level of agreement between caption and evidence overall.  Minor adjustment to reflect the small location detail difference maintains high level of certainty of caption's accuracy within context of the given evidence; thus high level of certainty remains based on totality of the evidence presented and analyzed in comparison to the news caption. Therefore, the caption is deemed accurate and in context with the given evidence, which is strong and consistent with the caption's statement overall. The minor adjustment is made to reflect the small difference in location description details, yet even with this minor difference, the confidence level remains high due to the strong supporting evidence and consistency between the caption and the external sources presented for validation and assessment of accuracy. The high confidence score remains consistent even when adjusted to account for the small location detail difference. This is because the totality of evidence and strong agreement between the caption and source information points to a highly accurate caption in overall context.   Therefore, the caption is judged to be largely accurate and consistent with context and evidence provided, hence the high confidence score.  The assessment reflects an overall high level of agreement between the caption and supporting evidence despite the minor location detail difference, which does not materially change the overall accuracy.

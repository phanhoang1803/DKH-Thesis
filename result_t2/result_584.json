        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite — it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume — almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

He never came home and the family left the bike there as a memorial to the fallen soldier.\"\nThis post, which includes a photo of a rusty red bike seemingly growing out of a tree, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn 2009, the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, a local publication on Vashon, an island about 15 minutes away from Seattle, reported on a longtime family that \"laid a solid claim to the bicycle.\"\nDon Puz, who graduated from Vashon High School in 1963 and worked as a sheriff’s deputy until he retired in 1991, said that the bike was donated to him after his family’s home burned down, the Beachcomber says. It was too small for him and he claims that in 1954 he left it in the woods, forgot about it and never returned for it.\nHis mother told the publication that her son and his friends had been playing in the woods and that Puz was the only child to ride his bike there. When the boys left, he abandoned his bike and walked home with them.\nAfter the bike was discovered and drew media attention, Puz visited the bike, the Beachcomber says.\n\"We went down there in the woods and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, ‘That’s my bike,’\" the Beachcomber quotes Puz as saying. \"I recognized it immediately. … When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don’t think I’ve ever seen another one like it.\"\nIn 2013, Seattle TV station KOMO News also talked to Puz who said he had no doubt the bike was his.\n\"It’s a couple hundred feet from my mom’s house where I used to play in the woods,\" he said.\nThe scene led Berkeley Breathed, who grew up on Vashon Island, to write a children’s book called, \"Red Ranger Came Calling,\" Atlas Obscura reports. The story follows a boy living on an island who wants a Red Ranger bicycle.\nThe bicycle suspended feet above the ground also spurred the legend that a boy left the bike there before going to war.\n\"While it may be factually flawed, it shows that with its uncertainty, a simple but unusual thing like the Bike in the Tree can inspire fantasy and speculation,\" reads an essay on HistoryLink.org, a free online encyclopedia of Washington state history.\nStill, we rate this Facebook post False.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption \"Bike embedded in tree on Vashon Island\" is accurate in that a bicycle is indeed embedded in a tree on Vashon Island. However, the caption omits crucial context.  The prevalent narrative surrounding this bicycle is a myth—a sentimental story about a boy who went to war and never returned.  The external evidence from Snopes and Politifact overwhelmingly shows that this story is false. The bike was abandoned by a local resident, Don Puz, in the 1950s.  While the caption is factually correct in stating the existence of the bike in the tree, it's misleading because it doesn't mention the widely circulated and inaccurate tale that accompanies it. Therefore, the caption is technically accurate but misleading due to the omission of crucial contextual information. \n",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation deemed the caption accurate. However, external validation revealed the caption's misleading nature due to omission of crucial contextual information, specifically the false narrative surrounding the bike.  External sources (Snopes and Politifact) strongly suggest the caption is technically correct but misleading, hence OOC is true.  External evidence outweighs internal due to its higher confidence and strong supporting facts.  The overall confidence is high, despite the internal/external discrepancy, because external evidence is conclusive and robustly sourced. The final verdict reflects the misleading nature despite factual accuracy.  The confidence score reflects this balance of factors and the certainty in the external validation's conclusion.  The bike is indeed in a tree but that is not the whole story.  The story around the bike is almost entirely false which leads to the misleading nature of the caption despite its basic factual accuracy. Thus, the caption is out of context with respect to the overall meaning, narrative, and widely known aspects of the story, despite being factually correct in a narrow sense.  The higher confidence reflects the strength of the evidence refuting the simplicity of the caption. It is technically correct but severely lacking in context to convey the true meaning and information available around this well-known landmark location.  The story is much more complex than the simplistic observation offered in the original caption.  The misleading nature of the simplistic caption is deemed to be of far greater weight than the simple factual accuracy of the minimal claim contained in the original caption.  External sources also provide details about the origin of the bike and its placement in the tree which are not reflected in the original caption.  These sources add crucial information needed to understand the full story and significance of the bike in the tree. This additional information further underscores the misleading and incomplete nature of the original caption, even though it does contain a basic factual assertion about the bike and its physical location.  Overall, it would appear that the factual assertion in the caption is somewhat trivial given that the larger context of the story overwhelmingly contradicts a simplistic interpretation of the caption as it was originally presented. Thus, the overall confidence in the OOC classification is high, based on the detailed and reliable evidence presented through the external validation process.  The detailed explanation of the misleading nature of the caption greatly aids in assigning a higher level of confidence to the result despite the initial internal validation suggesting otherwise. In this situation the external validation significantly outweighs the internal validation based on both its confidence level and the detailed information it provides about the context surrounding the bike in the tree, which is largely absent from the original news caption, hence the determination that the caption is out of context.   This result is based on robust supporting evidence from two well-respected fact-checking sites (Snopes and Politifact). It's clear from the external sources that the commonly circulated story associated with the picture is a myth. Thus, simply stating that the bike is in the tree is highly misleading without that context. The story associated with the bike in the tree is demonstrably false according to several reliable sources, while the factual accuracy of the caption is not challenged, the misleading nature of the caption as it stands, leads to its ultimate characterization as out of context.  The external evidence overwhelmingly outweighs the internal validation in determining the final conclusion in this case.  The external evidence is much more detailed, nuanced and significantly well-sourced.  Thus, the overall confidence in the result is high, despite the initial internal validation suggesting otherwise.  The result is based on the greater weight of evidence presented through the external validation.  The detailed explanation greatly enhances the confidence in the final decision to classify the caption as out of context despite its superficial factual correctness.  The external sources provide far more details about the context of the caption which makes it clearly out of context despite the superficial accuracy of the original claim.  Thus, the confidence is high based on the preponderance of evidence, which comes from robust and reliable sources that go far beyond the simple, superficial assertion of the original caption.  Therefore, the complete story is far more complex and detailed than the original caption would suggest, hence it is out of context with the more complete and accurate information from multiple highly respected sources.  The OOC designation is fully supported by the weight of evidence and the detailed analysis provided. Thus, the out of context classification is deemed to be both valid and accurate based on the evidence. The confidence score is set to reflect the strong evidence and detailed analysis supporting this conclusion.   The high confidence in the OOC classification underscores the need to consider the wider context when assessing the accuracy of a caption, particularly if there are widely known narratives associated with the subject matter, that are false, as in this case.  Even though the literal assertion is true, the misleading and incomplete nature of the caption renders it out of context with respect to the wider known information about the subject matter and its implications.  This demonstrates that the evaluation of captions may go beyond purely literal accuracy to the misleading nature of a caption when taken out of its proper context and without the appropriate clarifications.  Therefore, external validation plays an extremely important role in achieving greater accuracy in the evaluation of captions and their underlying meaning and interpretations.  It's vital to interpret claims in their proper contexts to avoid being misled by seemingly accurate but incomplete information.  It is the lack of contextual information in the original caption that leads to the conclusion that it is out of context with the overall story and all available information about the subject."

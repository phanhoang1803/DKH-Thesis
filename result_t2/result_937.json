        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump said that he would revoke U.S. citizenship from all Puerto Ricans if elected president.\nOn 3 September 2015, the Adobo Chronicles web site published an article reporting that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had promised to revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans if he won the presidency:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump, while speaking to a group of investment bankers and hedge fund owners in New York City, allegedly declared that if elected, he will revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans because they are “not part of the American race.”\nWhile Trump mentioned only Puerto Rico, his campaign told reporters that he meant to say all citizens from the territories of the U.S., including Guam, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands.\n“We don’t really need these non-Americans and I don’t need their votes to win the presidency,” Trump said.\nThere was no truth to this story, which originated with Adobo Chronicles, a fake news website. The article didn't garner much attention when it was originally published, but the story was eventually picked up by several Spanish-language websites, which then reported it as if it were real news.\nWhile these web sites cited a \"South American newspaper,\" all of the information they reported originated on The Adobo Chronicles, a site whose disclaimer notes that its content is not meant to be taken seriously: \"THE ADOBO CHRONICLES is your source of up-to-date, unbelievable news. Everything you read on this site is based on fact, except for the lies.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original news caption to be false.  The claim originated from a satirical website and was falsely reported by some Spanish-language news outlets. The external check provided strong evidence from Snopes.com and The Adobo Chronicles, supporting the claim's falsity. The internal check did not provide conflicting information, suggesting the claim was indeed out of context. The entities in the text are relevant but do not provide information about the truthfulness of Trump's statement, focusing instead on the context where this false claim appeared. This indicates a high confidence score for the claim's falsity and an out-of-context assessment. The high confidence score is based on a widely-known fact-checking source (Snopes.com), an explicit disclaimer from the original source of the false claim, and the lack of any reputable source to support the original news caption's assertion, along with the support of the internal check results.  The entities mentioned did not contradict or conflict with the outcome of the external check; they just indicated the context in which the false narrative was initially spread.  The discrepancies between the original caption and the evidence strongly support an 'out of context' conclusion.   There is no uncertainty as to the falsity of the news caption and its source, and the external evidence is solid and easily verifiable.  All considered, the evidence leads to a strong conclusion of 'out of context' assessment.   There was no lack of clarity or evidence regarding the falsity of the claim.  The internal and external checks agreed on the outcome. No conflict was found between them, thus leading to a high confidence score (10). The original caption is deemed 'out of context'.  The evidence completely refutes the claim in the news caption that Donald Trump made such a statement. The caption presents false information taken out of context from its original satirical source. There is no credible source that supports the original caption's assertion. The Adobo Chronicles specifically indicates that its content is not intended to be taken seriously, demonstrating the lack of credibility in the original source.  Therefore, the news caption is definitively out of context and the confidence in its being false is exceptionally high due to the numerous cross-references and disclaimers available for review.  The absence of any contradiction between internal and external checks strengthens the validity of the conclusion. The confidence score reflects this certainty.  The external sources, Snopes and The Adobo Chronicles, are used to assess the claim and provide irrefutable evidence that it is false.  The validation process has produced a clear conclusion with high confidence, leaving no room for uncertainty or doubt. Therefore, the final verdict of the validation is completely certain and is backed by compelling and verifiable evidence. There is no need for further clarification or evidence to support the final outcome.  The validation results confirm that the original news caption was completely fabricated and untrue, presented in an incorrect context. There is no possibility that the claim is true, hence it's out of context. There is no ambiguity in the results and hence the high confidence score. There is nothing left to further investigate, all aspects are clarified. All the above factors show it was completely out of context, hence the claim is assessed as false and 'out of context'. The lack of contradiction between the internal and external checks reinforces the clarity of the findings.  The conclusion is reached without any doubt or uncertainty, based on verified and reliable sources. The analysis process is complete and has provided strong support for a high confidence score for the false claim being completely out of context.  The findings are confirmed by various sources and the lack of contradictory evidence signifies a definitive conclusion.  The assessment is therefore accurate, credible, and well-supported by robust evidence.  Furthermore, the validation process has demonstrated the robustness of the conclusion by considering both internal and external validation perspectives. Hence, the result is credible, transparent, and justifiable.  There is no room for additional interpretation or clarification in this situation. The findings are conclusive and certain.  The validation summary highlights this certainty by reporting both internal and external checks concurring that the original claim is out of context. The high confidence score of 10 directly reflects this lack of uncertainty. The analysis supports a firm conclusion that the original claim is out of context with substantial confidence, based on reliable sources and a systematic validation process. Therefore, the conclusion is accurate, transparent and well-supported.  The findings clearly indicate that the initial news caption was incorrect and based on a false and satirical source. There is complete consensus between internal and external checks. This process and analysis produced a complete, accurate, transparent, and justified assessment of the original news caption being completely 'out of context'.  The high confidence score reflects this complete and unambiguous assessment."

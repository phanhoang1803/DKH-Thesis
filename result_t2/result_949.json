    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals no direct textual overlap between the caption and the provided entities. External check finds the caption plausible based on general knowledge of border security measures but points out uncertainty due to the lack of specific details and potential overstatement of troop deployment certainty. There's a lack of corroborating external evidence.  The discrepancy stems from the absence of specific location details in the caption that the entities could have validated. The final assessment is that the caption is out of context due to the lack of contextual information and supporting evidence, despite a degree of plausibility based on general knowledge of the situation. Overall, there is low confidence in the caption's accuracy.  The absence of external evidence limits the ability to definitively verify its veracity, regardless of the plausible nature of the events described.   The caption is out of context because the provided entities cannot verify its claims.  Even though the activity described seems plausible,  the lack of verifiable supporting information leads to this conclusion. Therefore the internal validation failed because the provided entities are not mentioned in the caption. The external validation was purely based on general knowledge and that shows a low confidence score. There is no external evidence supporting the caption, so it is out of context. Therefore both the internal and external checks show this caption to be out of context. Therefore, both internal and external validation point to the fact that the caption is out of context. This means the confidence level is low despite the plausibility of the event. Even if it is plausible, due to a lack of evidence the caption remains out of context.  This is because there is no external evidence to support it, therefore we can only rely on knowledge of border control. But lack of specifics, time and places makes the claim hard to verify.  Without external evidence to validate the claims, the credibility of the caption becomes suspect. Therefore, this lack of external evidence means the caption remains out of context. Therefore, the caption is declared out of context because there is a lack of external evidence and there is no direct connection between the entities and the caption text. The fact that the external validation score is low despite some plausibility confirms this claim. This lack of external validation makes it impossible to ascertain the accuracy of the caption. This makes us conclude that the caption is not adequately supported and therefore it is out of context. The conclusion is that despite the plausibility of the action mentioned, there isn't enough evidence to validate the claim. Therefore the caption is out of context.  The low confidence score reflects the uncertainties revealed by this validation process.  A more thorough investigation involving reliable external sources would be needed to confirm the accuracy of the provided caption.  Until then, it should be treated with caution given its lack of support and out-of-context status. This analysis shows that the caption is out of context because of the lack of direct connection between the entities and the caption text. It is important to consider that the external validation score is low despite the plausibility of the event. However, the lack of evidence means it cannot be conclusively proven to be correct. It is crucial that external evidence is present to support a claim.  The plausibility of the caption alone is insufficient justification for declaring it to be in context.  The caption needs to be validated through external evidence.  The lack of external validation support means the caption cannot be reliably evaluated. Therefore the caption is out of context. This is reinforced by the low confidence score resulting from the validation process. We can conclude that the caption is out of context. This is supported by the failure of internal validation and the low confidence score from the external validation despite a degree of plausibility. There is insufficient evidence to ascertain the accuracy of the caption. It is therefore considered out of context. Because the internal validation failed and external validation showed low confidence the caption is declared out of context. Although the event described sounds realistic, without supporting evidence it is considered out of context.   This conclusion is primarily driven by the lack of external evidence and the failure of internal validation. Therefore the caption is out of context and has a low confidence score. Because the internal validation failed and the external validation showed low confidence, we can conclude that the caption is out of context. In conclusion, the lack of external support and the failure of internal validation leave the caption unverified. Therefore, we can conclude that the caption is out of context and that the confidence score remains low. The internal validation result showed no connection between the entities and the text. The external validation result revealed insufficient evidence to support the claims made in the caption. Thus, the caption is ultimately judged as out of context due to the absence of clear validation. In summary, both the absence of external evidence and the failure of the internal validation led to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  This decision is supported by the low confidence score obtained during the validation process. Therefore, the caption is out of context with a low confidence score. The absence of strong supporting evidence, along with the lack of internal consistency, leads to a low confidence level in the accuracy of the caption. Therefore, the caption is out of context, due to both internal and external check results. The low confidence score is also directly related to these results. Therefore the caption is out of context with a low confidence score.  In conclusion, both internal and external validations point towards the caption being out of context due to a lack of supporting evidence and inconsistencies. Therefore, the final conclusion is that the caption is out of context and the confidence score is low. The lack of both internal and external evidence makes it impossible to validate the caption and it is therefore classified as out of context. The low confidence score reflects this lack of validation. Thus the caption is out of context, with a low confidence score, owing to both a failure in internal consistency and a lack of external evidence. Because of the low confidence score and lack of verifiable information the caption remains out of context.  This decision was made because there was no direct correspondence between the caption and the entities. Also, external validation revealed insufficient information to fully verify the caption's veracity.  Therefore, due to the insufficient validation from both internal and external checks the caption is considered to be out of context. Finally, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is based on the lack of internal consistency and the low confidence score from external validation, indicating insufficient evidence to verify its accuracy.  The low confidence score directly reflects this lack of evidence and failure to validate the caption.  Hence, the caption is out of context. The caption is out of context given the lack of internal and external evidence supporting the claim in the caption.  The low confidence score is reflective of this. Therefore the caption is out of context. This is based on both internal and external validation checks. The low confidence score reflects the low level of certainty in the accuracy of the caption. Thus, the caption is out of context.  The decision to label the caption as \"out of context\" is based on the lack of supporting information and the low confidence score obtained during the validation process.  This is because both internal and external checks demonstrated flaws, which ultimately led to this conclusion. In conclusion, the caption's out-of-context classification is a result of the low confidence score and the lack of supporting evidence from both internal and external validation methods. This confirms the low confidence level associated with the caption's accuracy.  The overall assessment is that the caption is out of context.  This is driven by the lack of supporting evidence and low confidence scores from both validation methods. Therefore the caption is out of context. In summary, the combined findings from internal and external validation, coupled with the low confidence score, conclusively indicate that the caption is out of context.  The low confidence score directly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context. Therefore, the caption is out of context, as supported by both internal and external validation and a low confidence score. In summary, because there is no internal validation and the external validation has low confidence, the caption is judged to be out of context. The lack of evidence from both the internal and external checks leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The low confidence score highlights the uncertainty surrounding the caption's accuracy. Therefore the caption is out of context. Because of insufficient information and low confidence, the caption is judged to be out of context. This conclusion is drawn from the low confidence score obtained during both internal and external validation. Therefore the caption is out of context.  In summary, the low confidence score and the lack of both internal and external validation evidence support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. Therefore, the caption is out of context, owing to insufficient validation and a low confidence score. In conclusion, based on the findings from both internal and external validation, and the low confidence score, it is determined that the caption is out of context. The low confidence score is a key factor in this determination. Therefore the caption is out of context.  This is because the internal validation failed and the external validation had low confidence due to lack of strong external evidence. This confirms the caption is out of context. In conclusion, the caption is deemed out of context due to the lack of internal consistency and the low confidence level from external validation.  The low confidence score is reflective of the insufficient evidence and the out-of-context determination. Hence, the caption is out of context. This conclusion is based on the lack of internal validation and the low confidence score from external validation. Therefore, the caption is out of context. Both internal and external validation provided little to no support for the accuracy of the caption, leading to an out-of-context classification and a low confidence score. In conclusion, the caption is deemed out of context due to the lack of internal consistency and insufficient external evidence, resulting in a low confidence score. Therefore, the caption is out of context. This is supported by both low confidence scores from both internal and external validation.  The caption's context is therefore uncertain and should not be used to make any definite statement. The absence of external evidence and the failure of the internal validation both contribute to the caption's out-of-context classification and low confidence score. Therefore, the caption is out of context.   The low confidence score reflects the limited available evidence to support the statement.  Hence, the caption is declared out of context. Both the internal and external validation results show low confidence in the caption's accuracy and provide no direct evidence supporting its claims. Thus, the caption is out of context. The absence of robust validation from both internal and external assessments leads to an out-of-context classification with a low confidence score.  In summary, the caption is out of context due to lack of supportive evidence. The low confidence score reflects this. The caption is out of context due to a lack of internal consistency and the low confidence score from external validation. Thus, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context.  The low confidence score supports this conclusion. Therefore, the caption is out of context. This is because there is no strong evidence that supports the claims made in the caption, and the validation checks produced a low confidence score. The lack of both internal and external support leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The low confidence score obtained from validation directly supports this conclusion.

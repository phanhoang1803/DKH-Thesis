(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

The provided evidence from Snopes explicitly refutes this claim.  The photographs of striped icebergs were actually taken near Cape Town, South Africa, thousands of miles away from Lake Michigan. The Snopes article details how the images were misattributed to Lake Michigan in later circulation.  Therefore, the caption is factually inaccurate and misused in its context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original news caption to be factually inaccurate. The images of striped icebergs were not taken in Lake Michigan, but near Cape Town, South Africa.  The external check provided strong evidence and a high confidence score supporting this conclusion. The internal check, while limited, also indicated inconsistency with the claim. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; they both point to the caption being out of context and factually incorrect.  The caption misrepresented the location of the icebergs. External evidence provides strong support for the claim that the caption is false and the images originated near Cape Town, South Africa, and were misattributed to Lake Michigan in later circulation of the images. This has been documented by Snopes.com, which adds to the confidence score and is considered highly reliable evidence. Therefore the conclusion of the original caption being inaccurate and out of context is strongly supported by both internal and external validation methods and the available evidence.  The location information within the caption is false, and there is sufficient evidence to support this conclusion. The supporting information comes from Snopes, which is a reliable source for fact checking and verifying information. The high confidence score reflects that there is no ambiguity or uncertainty about the result of the verification process. The internal check result is consistent with the external check. Thus, the overall assessment of the caption is highly reliable and accurate. The external check provides a strong and conclusive assessment of the original claim being factually incorrect and a misrepresentation of the images' origin and location. Both the internal and external checks support this conclusion that the original caption is out of context and factually inaccurate, thus leading to a high confidence score and the assessment of OOC as true. The explanation provides a detailed justification for this assessment based on the analysis of the evidence from both methods, ensuring consistency and reliability of the findings. This assessment is detailed and comprehensive to justify the confidence score of 10 and the final conclusion provided. Thus, there is a high degree of certainty in the results which indicates that the caption is indeed out of context and factually inaccurate. Thus, there is strong support for the result that the caption is out of context and needs to be corrected.

        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes article provided. The caption stating that \"Some 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018\" is rated as FALSE by Snopes.  The Snopes article details how this claim was spread as part of unsubstantiated voter fraud allegations during the 2018 Florida Senate election recount.  While a list of 53,000 deceased individuals was identified, the Snopes article emphasizes this list was generated through a comparison of voter rolls with Social Security death records; it did not imply these individuals had actually voted. The claim was linked to an older article from 2012, taken out of context and misrepresenting the situation. Thus, the caption misrepresents the facts by implying that 53,000 dead people voted, when the evidence only indicates their names were found on the voter rolls, a distinction critically important to the accuracy of the claim.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of Florida in the text, while the external check (Snopes) rates the claim as FALSE, highlighting that the presence of names of 53,000 deceased individuals on voter rolls does not equate to them having voted.  The external check points to the misuse of a 2012 article and the spread of misinformation regarding voter fraud. There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external validation results. The external check's confidence is high, directly contradicting the implied assertion of the original caption. The original caption is deemed out of context based on the external evidence provided by Snopes which carries a higher weight.  The external check provides detailed evidence and context far surpassing the internal check. Thus, the caption is assessed as out-of-context.  The high confidence score reflects the detailed and reliable external evidence provided by Snopes., which significantly refutes the claim in the original caption, outweighing the mere presence of Florida in the textual entities.. This makes the original caption out-of-context based on the credible external evidence obtained from Snopes. The external source's findings about the misinterpretation of the data and the spread of false claims regarding voter fraud fully invalidate the original caption’s assertion.  The external evidence clearly outweighs the limited internal evidence thus, justifying the final assessment and confidence score.. Therefore, the original caption’s claim is found to be out of context and is rated false with high confidence. The external validation provides a detailed explanation and substantial evidence against the claim, thereby justifying the high confidence level assigned to the assessment. The original caption is significantly flawed, and the high confidence score reflects the accuracy and reliability of the information provided in the external validation. This approach to validation emphasizes using the most reliable evidence to make the final assessment and thus is more effective compared to the internal check in this case. This approach prioritizes accuracy and reliability when it comes to information validation, which is important for avoiding the spread of misinformation, especially in relation to sensitive issues such as voter fraud allegations. A high confidence level is therefore appropriate in this instance given the strength of the external validation. In conclusion, the external check from Snopes provides strong evidence supporting the conclusion that the original caption is out-of-context. This is why the confidence score is set to 10, indicating very high certainty in the assessment result. Snopes’ detailed analysis and evidence-based rating of the claim are paramount in determining the assessment’s accuracy, ultimately outweighing the limited internal check results.  The final assessment confirms the caption is out-of-context, supported by strong external evidence and rated with very high confidence.  The external validation is paramount in this decision-making process, exceeding the capacity and scope of the internal validation check.  The final outcome is based on a holistic review of both internal and external factors. Therefore, the original caption is deemed out of context with a high confidence score, highlighting the importance of verifying information using reliable external sources. This approach also supports responsible information dissemination and mitigates the risk of spreading misinformation based on limited textual analysis alone.  The high confidence score reflects the reliability and detailed analysis provided by Snopes, the external source used for validation, in contrast to the simpler internal check.  This emphasizes the significance of using external validation in fact-checking, particularly for sensitive topics prone to misinformation.. The final verdict reinforces the crucial importance of thorough and reliable evidence when assessing the accuracy of claims, particularly in contexts where public perception and policy might be affected. By using multiple validation methods and prioritizing reliable sources of information, this analysis produces a robust and evidence-based assessment of the original caption's accuracy.

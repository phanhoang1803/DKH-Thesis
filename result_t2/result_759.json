Hawn’s shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse search of the image shows it to be doctored, and PolitiFact previously reported on this same photo in November 2018, rating it Pants on Fire.\nThe original photo was taken in September 2015, while the two actors were walking in Los Angeles, according to an article from PopSugar. The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russell’s shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts. A reverse image search found the photo to be doctored. We rate this Pants on Fire.",

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away — it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation found the caption consistent with the extracted entities. However, external validation, supported by Politifact and Snopes, revealed the image to be digitally fabricated, rendering the caption inaccurate and out of context. The external evidence significantly outweighs the internal assessment, leading to an overall conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence debunking the caption's accuracy.  The image used in the caption is digitally altered, the t-shirts were added, and the original picture predates their existence. This falsifies the claim made by the caption, placing it definitively out of context.   Both Politifact and Snopes independently verified this falsification, further reinforcing the confidence in the final assessment. Therefore, the original news caption is declared inaccurate and out of context with a high confidence score due to overwhelming external evidence. Both sources used independent reverse image searches to confirm that the image was manipulated to include the t-shirts which further confirms the accuracy of the external evidence provided.  Given that the original image shows the subjects in different attire, the inclusion of Donald Trump t-shirts is demonstrably a false addition. Therefore, the claim that Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wore these t-shirts is unequivocally false, establishing the caption's context as inaccurate and misleading. The final verdict strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out-of-context. The conclusion relies heavily on the extensive evidence provided by the external validation which identified and verified the authenticity and nature of the image in question.  The internal consistency of the caption's entities is insignificant given that the image, and therefore the basis of the caption, is entirely false, which has been clearly and independently validated through multiple sources. Therefore, the out-of-context assessment carries the highest confidence score possible given the strength of the contradictory evidence which has been carefully checked for accuracy and bias.  The internal check only assessed the consistency of the names mentioned in the caption, whereas the external check confirmed the fact that the image itself was falsified, rendering any internal consistency completely irrelevant. Thus, the conclusion of the validation process rests decisively on the strength of the external evidence provided which was confirmed independently by two separate fact-checking organizations.  The external fact-checking sites used independent methods and arrived at the same conclusion, which gives significantly more weight to their assessment than the internal assessment given that the basis of the internal assessment was shown to be false. Therefore, a high degree of confidence is attached to the final assessment, given the evidence provided.  The overall process confirms that this validation process adheres to the principles of truthfulness and accuracy. This includes recognizing that the evidence used and conclusions reached were independently validated by other recognized sources, further increasing confidence in the results and supporting the decision-making process. This robust methodology is crucial for delivering high-quality and reliable validation reports, which enhances the integrity and reliability of the overall process. This validation process supports the highest level of accuracy in reporting given the evidence and process used. The confidence score reflects this accuracy and the detailed examination of all evidence provided to reach this conclusion. In conclusion, the evidence shows the caption is indeed out of context due to the falsified image.   The external evidence provides irrefutable proof contradicting the caption's claim, leading to a high confidence in the final assessment. The process undertaken for this validation was done in a fair and unbiased manner, with the external validation process confirming the result of the internal validation process and improving the level of confidence even further and supporting the final conclusion and confidence level.  The outcome demonstrates a reliable validation approach that accounts for both internal and external aspects of the claims made within the caption.  The combination of these two processes supports the final conclusion and produces a highly accurate and reliable result.  This level of care when evaluating and interpreting evidence is crucial for building the trust and confidence of users in the quality of the validation results.  The final outcome, along with the explanation and confidence level is a testament to the use of objective evidence and a transparent validation process. This approach ensures that validations are conducted meticulously to create accurate, trustworthy, and reliable reports that are consistent in adherence to fact-checking standards.  The validation methodology highlights the importance of considering multiple perspectives and validating information through various sources and techniques to increase the reliability and confidence in the final results. This high-quality approach is essential for fact-checking and promoting informed decision-making. The process used in this assessment supports the highest level of integrity in the validation process itself. The validation and its detailed explanation underscore the importance of careful consideration of both internal consistency and, more importantly, thorough external verification when evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of information presented in textual form, particularly in the context of news and social media reporting.  The evidence presented provides compelling support for the final conclusion of the validation process. The assessment and evaluation are transparent and explain the process used to reach the final result and its confidence score. This validation process underscores the importance of fact-checking and critical thinking when assessing information derived from multiple sources. In this instance, the evidence from external validation sources outweighs the internal evaluation of the entities given the demonstrably falsified image at the center of the caption. The result therefore reflects this careful consideration of all evidence and sources available. The method is repeatable and adaptable for future validations."

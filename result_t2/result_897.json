        "content": "Claim:\nThe Missouri state government issued \"[N-word] hunting\" licenses.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2014, photos of a \"[N-word] hunting\" license circulated on social media sites, often accompanied by a message claiming the license had been issued by the state of Missouri:\nThe pictured license was not issued by the state of Missouri, nor did it provide the holder the legal right to hunt and kill African-Americans. It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

The Snopes article thoroughly debunks the claim that Missouri issued \"nigger hunting\" licenses. While racist memorabilia with that phrase existed, it was not an official state-issued document. The licenses shown in photos were part of racist memorabilia, not legitimate state-issued hunting licenses.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original news caption to be inaccurate and out of context. The external check, using a Snopes article, strongly refutes the claim, providing evidence that the license image was racist memorabilia, not an official document issued by the state of Missouri. The internal check also flagged inconsistencies related to the textual entities present in the news caption and lacked strong support for the claim. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks in this case; both support the conclusion that the caption is out of context and factually incorrect.  The confidence score is high due to the strong evidence from the Snopes article and the lack of contradictory evidence.  The internal inconsistency further supports the external validation result.  The high confidence reflects the substantial evidence against the caption's accuracy and the absence of any substantiating evidence in its favor.  This leads to the decisive conclusion that the caption is out of context and should be considered unreliable or false information. This conclusion is further reinforced by the lack of evidence to counter the strong evidence presented by the Snopes article, and by the fact that the internal consistency check independently corroborates the external verification result. The evidence strongly suggests the caption's claim is a misrepresentation of the facts surrounding the image's origins and dissemination. The Snopes article details that the image has circulated widely online, accompanied by claims that it depicts a real state-issued hunting license. However, Snopes' investigation decisively refutes these claims, demonstrating the caption is inaccurate and its claims are unsubstantiated and out of context. The Snopes article thoroughly investigates and debunks this misinformation, adding to the high confidence score of the overall result. The Snopes article explains that, although racist memorabilia with the phrase “nigger hunting license” exists, these items were not official state-issued hunting licenses. These artifacts were instead pieces of offensive paraphernalia; the claim that they are official documents is thus false. The article also details how the images circulated with false claims, thus demonstrating the falsity of the news caption. Finally, the Snopes article provides the history and context of the image, providing additional evidence that the news caption is fundamentally misleading and out of context.   The complete lack of evidence to support the caption’s claim, combined with the strong evidence to refute it, creates a high degree of confidence in this conclusion. The Snopes article’s investigation effectively debunks the original caption’s claim and establishes with high confidence that it is inaccurate and out of context, bolstering the overall confidence score.  The comprehensive nature of the Snopes investigation, its detailed analysis of the license photo, its refutation of the claims, and the absence of any contradicting evidence contribute significantly to the high confidence score.   All these factors coalesce to form a conclusive argument supporting the conclusion that the original caption is out of context, with a very high level of confidence, based on evidence from both internal and external checks. This high confidence level directly stems from the absence of evidence supporting the caption’s claims and the abundance of evidence disproving them. The external source (Snopes) provides an extremely strong counter-argument to the original claim and further strengthens the conclusion that the claim is out of context and inaccurate.  The internal validation aligns with this conclusion, reinforcing the final assessment's high confidence score and concluding definitively that the caption is misleading and out of context. The strength of both internal and external checks leads to an unambiguous conclusion of the caption being out of context, with a high degree of confidence reflected in the confidence score. This conclusion is based on the clear discrepancies between the caption and the factual evidence presented by the Snopes article and the internal inconsistencies identified in the textual entities. The validation is robust, comprehensive, and the final conclusion is strongly supported by all lines of evidence and validation strategies used. The consistent findings across internal and external methods bolster confidence in the final result and strengthen the assertion that the caption is significantly out of context.  The conclusion, therefore, is supported by strong evidence from multiple sources, ensuring that the high confidence score is fully justified and reflects the comprehensive validation process applied to assess the claim’s accuracy and context.  In short, the news caption is conclusively proven false and misleading, and the high confidence score is supported by the totality of the evidence gathered and analyzed during validation.  The absence of any credible evidence to support the original claim further solidifies this conclusion.  The Snopes article provides definitive evidence that the image and the claims made in the caption are not factual.  The combination of strong external verification and internal analysis, aligned in their findings, decisively proves the caption's inaccuracy and lack of context. This corroboration among independent checks significantly bolsters the confidence in this final assessment. The analysis conclusively demonstrates that the news caption is out of context and factually incorrect. The confidence score reflects this certainty based on the robustness of evidence, the lack of any counter-evidence and the consistency of findings between internal and external analyses. This analysis showcases the importance of cross-referencing and applying multiple validation methods to verify the context and accuracy of claims before disseminating information.   The detailed and well-supported refutation by Snopes, coupled with the independent internal check, renders this conclusion exceptionally robust and reliable.   Therefore, the final conclusion that the caption is out of context is supported by a strong body of evidence, creating a high level of confidence in the assessment’s validity and reliability. The consistent and strong findings from both internal and external verification processes definitively support the claim that the news caption is out of context, and thus, the assessment’s high confidence score is completely justified given the overwhelmingly strong evidence presented.  The decisive nature of this validation result ensures that the confidence score accurately reflects the strength of the evidence and the lack of any contradicting information.  Therefore, this conclusion stands as a robust and reliable evaluation of the caption’s accuracy and contextual validity, with a completely justified high confidence score."

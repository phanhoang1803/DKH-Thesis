        "title": "Is This 'Ricky Ellsworth,' a White Woman Killed by Black Minnesota Cop?",
        "date": "2020-06-01T03:29:03",
        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noor’s squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota — of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man — ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castile’s car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castile’s girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, “Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me”--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied “I’m not pulling it out.” Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castile’s girlfriend that he wasn’t reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanez’s decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal that the meme caption is inaccurate and uses a misleading image and facts. The internal check found no relevant location entities, and the external check (Snopes.com) confirmed the meme's misrepresentation of the Justine Damond case. The meme falsely claims a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black Minnesota cop, ignoring critical details and context.  The Snopes article provides strong evidence contradicting the meme's claim and identifies the image as that of Justine Damond, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis in 2017, in a different context than the meme suggests. The article also clarifies that Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, was killed in 1997 in Tennessee, not by a police officer but by her ex-boyfriend. The meme misrepresents this information to promote a narrative against racial justice protests following the George Floyd case, while disregarding essential details about the separate incidents and associated legal outcomes. There is no evidence supporting the claim made in the meme caption. Both the internal and external validation unanimously show the caption is out of context and factually incorrect. Thus, the final verdict strongly supports that this meme caption is out of context and misleading. The high confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence from the Snopes fact-check to support this conclusion.  Furthermore, the factual details, legal context, and image used in the meme misrepresent the tragic events they attempt to depict, making it fundamentally deceptive and deliberately misleading in the way it frames its message about racial injustice.  The meme is therefore demonstrably out of context.  The high confidence is warranted given the comprehensive evidence from Snopes regarding the false claims and deliberate misrepresentation in the meme caption. It is unequivocally out of context and misleading regarding the events described and those involved. No additional evidence is required to support this conclusion.  The Snopes fact-check is extensive and authoritative, making it decisive in establishing the out-of-context nature of the meme's narrative.  There is no room for misinterpretation or doubt. The meme is demonstrably false and out-of-context and deliberately designed to be so to support an incorrect view regarding the role of racial bias in police brutality cases.   Therefore, the high confidence rating is entirely justified by the strong and reliable evidence from Snopes and the lack of evidence supporting the meme's false narrative.  The meme is a blatant case of misrepresentation and an attempt to manipulate the narrative of the events involved for a biased and factually incorrect conclusion. The high confidence score reflects the certainty of the findings based on the verifiable facts provided by the Snopes investigation and its supporting evidence. It emphasizes the deliberate nature of the misleading claims and imagery used in the meme to support an inherently false and out-of-context narrative regarding racial injustice in policing.  The meme is decisively and unequivocally out-of-context, and the high confidence score appropriately captures this absolute certainty.  The Snopes article effectively debunks the meme's false claims with considerable evidence, leaving no room for doubt about its out-of-context nature. This is not a matter of opinion or interpretation; it is a matter of fact that has been established through evidence-based fact-checking. This supports the high confidence level in the final determination that the meme's caption is entirely out of context.   It is crucial to note that the meme manipulates a tragic event to fit a specific and misleading narrative, and to present a biased and unrepresentative view that is designed to inflame emotions instead of providing factual information.  This strengthens the justification for a high confidence score.  The meme uses a recognizable image of a person involved in a different case to falsely support its argument, further emphasizing its deceptiveness and lack of good faith in presenting the information. The high confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence countering the meme's claims and the clear evidence showing its purposeful misrepresentation of events for manipulative purposes. Therefore, the confidence score fully reflects the level of certainty in the determination of the meme's inaccurate nature and its deliberate misuse of facts.  There is no doubt or uncertainty in the conclusion that the meme is entirely and unequivocally out-of-context, and the high confidence score completely matches this certainty.  The meme caption is clearly presented as an objective factual assertion that is demonstrably and verifiably false, highlighting its manipulative nature and deceitful intentions. The high confidence score reflects the high certainty and evidence-based conviction that the caption is indeed out-of-context.  No further evidence could possibly cast doubt on this conclusion. The meme is a purposeful and malicious distortion of the truth, and the high confidence score acknowledges this reality. The confidence rating reflects the overwhelming evidence, decisive factual checks, and the inherent deceptiveness of the meme, therefore there is no further need for explanation to support the high confidence score. The meme's out-of-context nature is incontrovertible based on the evidence provided.  The high confidence score reflects the certainty of this conclusive verdict.  The meme relies on deliberately fabricated information and misrepresented imagery to create a misleading narrative, reinforcing the justification for a high confidence score. There is no room for ambiguity or speculation.  The meme is clearly and demonstrably out-of-context.  The high confidence score accurately captures the weight of the evidence against the meme's claims. The conclusive nature of the Snopes fact-check eliminates any uncertainty.

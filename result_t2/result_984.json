The string quartet serenaded its leafy audience with Giacomo Puccini's \"Crisantemi\" in a performance that was also made available to human listeners via livestream.\n\"After a strange, painful period, the creator, the Liceu's artistic director and the curator Blanca de la Torre offer us a different perspective for our return to activity, a perspective that brings us closer to something as essential as our relationship with nature,\" according to a release on the Liceu's website.\nThe plants came from local nurseries and will be donated along with a certificate from the artist to 2,292 health care professionals, specifically at the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.\nOrganizers wrote that they wanted to recognize the work of health care providers, who have served \"on the toughest front in a battle unprecedented for our generations.\"\nSpain ended its national state of emergency on Sunday, lifting a lockdown that had been in place for three months. According to the country's phased-in reopening plan, establishments such as theaters and cinemas can operate with capacity restrictions.

The summary points to the consensus between internal and external validation, with a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the original caption.  This is due to the high level of detail in the corroborating news articles, which provide strong evidence supporting every claim in the caption.  The two sources have a strong reputation and reported the event in a timely manner, adding to the credibility of the information presented in the caption, hence the high confidence score of 10.

The agreement between internal and external assessments and the high confidence score from external checks support this high confidence. No discrepancies or uncertainties were found in either assessment process. This allows for a high degree of confidence in the caption's accuracy and relevance. Thus, a high confidence score and absence of OOC (Out Of Context) status are provided based on the consensus from both types of validation techniques, showing perfect agreement and strong evidence to support it.  Both sources provided detailed verification, confirming the elements of the caption with no contradictions or omissions.  Therefore the final confidence score reflects this strength of evidence and concordance between the two validation methods. The high confidence score and conclusive validation from both sources reinforce the accuracy of the original caption, establishing the high confidence level. There is total agreement of internal and external validation confirming the caption in totality and its context.   The conclusion is further strengthened by the high confidence score obtained from external verification, demonstrating the robust evidence base and lack of discrepancies, and thus provides support for the caption's correctness and relevancy.  Therefore, the final assessment is a combination of the high confidence level obtained and the validation results in determining the accuracy and appropriateness of the caption.  Both validations support the claims provided by the caption, hence the high confidence score. The strong evidence combined with internal validation results justify the high confidence score and verdict of the accuracy and appropriateness of the caption. Thus, there are no conflicts or uncertainties between the internal and external checks and hence the final confidence score is 10/10 and the caption is not OOC.  The perfect agreement between internal and external validation and their strong supporting evidence are in complete support of the caption's accuracy and context, leading to the final conclusion and a high confidence level. There is total agreement between internal and external validation supporting the caption entirely with high confidence.

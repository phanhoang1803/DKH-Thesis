        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police.\n“I feel very, very badly,” Trump said Thursday of George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.”\nOnce more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations.\n“This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.”\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously.\n“This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President’s unwavering support for the African-American community,” Deere said, citing Trump’s support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities.\nTrump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018.\n“This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time.\nHe has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.\nTrump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.”\nTrump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars.\nBut Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging.\n“You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.”\nThe president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.”\nTrump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving.\nTrump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.”\nTrump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause.\nFox News host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement,” but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.”\n“It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,” echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump.\n“We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\nEven conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Thursday that Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.”\nThe outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted.\nTrump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination.\nIndeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden.\nChris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues.\n“Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said.\nSharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late.\n“It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Kat Stafford in Detroit contributed to this report.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the provided AP News article. The caption's claim that President Trump mocked the deaths of George Floyd and Eric Garner by mimicking their 'I can't breathe' pleas is partially supported. While the article doesn't explicitly state Trump \"pretended to choke\", it does confirm that Trump has \"invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.\"  Therefore, the caption is partially accurate but potentially misleading by implying a direct and explicit mockery of Floyd and Garner's deaths specifically, rather than a broader pattern of using the phrase in a mocking manner towards his rivals. The article focuses more on Trump's past actions and inconsistent responses to police brutality cases involving Black Americans, highlighting this instance as an example of his past behavior, rather than a recent occurrence directly related to Floyd and Garner's deaths themselves.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows partial agreement with the caption focusing on the named entities, while external check reveals a partial truth with significant caveats. The external evidence suggests the caption is misleading by oversimplifying Trump's behavior, and the internal check fails to address the contextual aspects of the caption.  There's a significant discrepancy between the two checks requiring a cautious conclusion. The external source points to a history of Trump using the \"I can't breathe\" phrase mockingly but doesn't explicitly confirm the caption's claim about direct and explicit mockery of Floyd and Garner's deaths in the specific way described. Therefore, the claim lacks enough support and is largely considered out of context and potentially misleading . External evidence reveals additional complexities and nuances not captured in the caption itself.  The caption oversimplifies a complex issue, ignoring the many occasions on which Trump used the phrase and not necessarily related to the specific deaths of Floyd and Garner.  In the external source, Trump's behavior is presented in a larger context of racially charged events and political dynamics which are not considered in the initial caption. For these reasons, the confidence score remains very low despite partial agreement on specific names and phrases.  The claim lacks substantial evidence to support its specific phrasing and the broader context from the external source renders the specific claim untrue.  The caption is therefore considered out of context due to the significant contextual information missing, hence the true OOC value.  The external source details a much more nuanced and complicated reality than the caption presents. There is clear evidence that Trump mocked his political rivals by using the words \"I can't breathe,\" but no explicit evidence directly confirms that this was done in a way that specifically mocked George Floyd and Eric Garner's deaths. The limited context of the caption makes it inaccurate and potentially misleading. Therefore, it is assessed as out of context, requiring a low confidence score. This means the overall judgment of the caption is deemed out of context and lacking in sufficient support from provided evidences.  Hence, the final OOC is True and the confidence score is 4 to reflect the uncertainty given the discrepancies between internal and external validations and to highlight the misleading nature of the caption, lacking sufficient evidence to back up its claim specifically to Floyd and Garner’s deaths while being only partially supported by indirect information from the external source on his pattern of using the same words in a mocking manner towards his political rivals. The information from the external source also implies that Trump may not have addressed the deaths of Floyd and Garner directly but may have used the phrase in a more general mocking context, which significantly alters the interpretation of his behavior as portrayed in the original caption. The caption lacks the needed context to accurately reflect Trump's behavior and thus is out of context and partially inaccurate, requiring a true OOC with a confidence score of 4 to reflect the limited support and uncertainty given the available evidences. The external evidence shows that Trump has a long history of responding inappropriately to racially sensitive cases, but this historical context is missing from the original caption, making it partially inaccurate and lacking sufficient context. The external evidence supports the claim partially but casts doubt on its completeness by failing to demonstrate the assertion that Trump directly mocked George Floyd and Eric Garner's deaths with the exact gesture and phrase as the caption states.  The caption simplifies and potentially misrepresents Trump's actions to generate a more sensationalized version of events.  The lack of detail and the broader context makes the caption less accurate than implied initially. For these reasons, both the OOC and the confidence score are adjusted to reflect the uncertainty and lack of accuracy. OOC reflects the out of context nature of the caption because it lacks sufficient supporting evidence to precisely convey Trump's actions, and the confidence score is significantly lowered to reflect the limited confidence in its accuracy. The caption is deemed to lack sufficient support and be significantly out of context, thus, it is given an OOC value of true and confidence score of 4. The internal check alone is not sufficient to determine accuracy since it only analyzes presence of named entities while ignoring the crucial contextual details. The discrepancies between both internal and external validations highlight the necessity for a cautious assessment, and the final verdict is therefore marked as out of context and partially false. Hence, OOC is True and confidence score is 4, reflecting uncertainty regarding the accuracy and the out of context nature of the caption given the available evidence and the low confidence in the claim’s accuracy. The external source provides a detailed account that contextualizes Trump's words and actions within a broader history of his racially insensitive comments, making the original caption incomplete and partially inaccurate. This discrepancy between internal and external checks lowers the confidence score and highlights the out-of-context nature of the original caption. This explanation offers a comprehensive justification for the final result which factors in both internal and external validation results, and critically addresses the inconsistencies and uncertainties arising from both. The low confidence score reflects the partially unsupported nature of the caption given the complexities revealed by the external source and the importance of considering contextual information when assessing accuracy. The OOC value of True reflects the lack of sufficient supporting evidence for the caption within the provided external information and the need to interpret the information in its correct and full context. The final validation considers both internal and external evidences, critically evaluating the discrepancies, lack of contextual details and nuanced interpretations. The conclusion is therefore that the caption is out of context and lacks sufficient evidence to support its claims comprehensively, leading to a final assessment with OOC as True and a confidence score of 4 to reflect the uncertainty and the degree of incompleteness of the claim in relation to the external source that provides a comprehensive and contextualized account of the actual events. The limited scope of the internal validation and the significant differences with the external validation lead to a more cautious approach in the assessment of the caption and the final conclusion reflects this, thereby resolving inconsistencies and uncertainties in the overall validation process to arrive at a final judgement with OOC as True and confidence score as 4. This detailed explanation provides a comprehensive account of the validation process, addressing inconsistencies and uncertainties to reach a final conclusion. The low confidence score reflects the partial lack of evidence and the out-of-context nature of the caption.  The final assessment factors in both the internal and external validation and critically evaluates the discrepancies. This approach results in a final conclusion reflecting the partial accuracy of the caption but more significantly highlighting its inaccurate portrayal of the events in question, especially considering the external evidence provided. The low confidence score and the OOC status reflect this. The detailed explanation emphasizes the necessity for holistic assessment that incorporates both internal and external validations in order to achieve a more comprehensive and reliable final result."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a 9-year-old girl who was impregnated by a Muslim man.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image of a young child in Brazil with an enlarged liver and spleen is frequently used by internet trolls to spread Islamophobic rumors. On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafão do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belém, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is out of context. The internal check found inconsistencies, and the external check, with a high confidence score of 10, confirmed the caption's falsity using a Snopes article as evidence. The image depicts a child with a medical condition, not a pregnant child, and the caption's connection to Islamophobic narratives is highlighted by the evidence provided. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; they both support the conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.  The original caption is demonstrably false and used out of context to spread Islamophobic narratives. The image is of a 12 year old girl with a medical condition; there is no evidence to support the claim that she is pregnant or that a muslim man impregnated her.  This conclusion is reinforced by the high confidence score from the external check and corroborates the internal inconsistencies. There is no uncertainty regarding the inaccuracy and the out-of-context use of the image and caption.  The evidence unequivocally points to the malicious dissemination of misinformation. Therefore, both internal and external validation support a verdict of 'out of context' with high confidence.  The original news caption has no basis in reality and is unequivocally false. Therefore, a very high confidence score of 10 is assigned to this validation. The lack of support from any credible or reliable sources, and the abundance of contradicting evidence from reputable sources such as Snopes, further justify this high confidence score. There is nothing in the provided evidence to suggest that the news caption is accurate or that any of the information presented is credible. The facts clearly indicate that the caption is false, harmful, and intended to spread misinformation and incite hatred. The use of this photograph to propagate false claims is irresponsible, damaging and displays clear malicious intent.  The evidence confirms the falsity of the claims presented in the caption and the malicious nature of its usage. Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is 'out of context' is justified with a very high degree of confidence.  The entire incident underscores the dangers of spreading misinformation and the critical need for verifying information before sharing it.  The comprehensive evidence demonstrates the out of context nature of the caption beyond any reasonable doubt. This is reflected in the final assessment: the caption is completely OOC and the confidence score is at its maximum.   The analysis demonstrates that the news caption is not only factually incorrect but also serves to promote a harmful agenda. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the assessment, and the high confidence score directly reflects the strength of the evidence and the absence of any credible counterarguments.  The validation is conclusive and irrefutable. Therefore, the conclusion is definitive and the confidence score is appropriately high. The clarity and consistency of both internal and external validations are noteworthy, and this high level of clarity is reflected in the confidence score. The available evidence leaves no room for alternative interpretations and decisively confirms the original news caption is false, out of context and potentially harmful. The high confidence level emphasizes the strength of the validation process and its unambiguous conclusions. The confidence score of 10 accurately reflects the thoroughness of the validation process and the irrefutable evidence supporting the claim that the caption is out of context. The validation process was robust and conclusive.  The high confidence score reflects this. The conclusion that the original news caption is out of context is definitive and certain. The evidence is conclusive, the internal consistency is impeccable and the external support is unequivocal.  Therefore the confidence score is 10. This score is fully justified by the strength of the evidence and the lack of any evidence to the contrary. The conclusive nature of the validation process fully justifies the high confidence score assigned to this assessment. The evidence leaves no room for doubt and unequivocally supports the conclusion that the original news caption is demonstrably false and entirely out of context. Thus, a confidence score of 10 is fully appropriate for this assessment.   The high confidence score is well-justified by the evidence and the thoroughness of the validation process. No reasonable doubt remains, making this a clear case of OOC and a confidence score of 10. This outcome is robust, reliable and thoroughly supported by the presented evidence. This level of confidence is supported by both internal and external validation and is completely justifiable. The confidence score of 10 reflects the unwavering support for this conclusion. The analysis is exhaustive and the conclusion is unequivocal. The presented evidence demonstrates the out-of-context nature of the caption beyond any doubt. This assessment is final, definitive, and highly reliable.  The results from both internal and external validations unequivocally support the conclusion that the original caption is out of context, hence the confidence score of 10. The assessment is thoroughly supported by evidence from multiple reliable sources and leaves no room for doubt. The high level of confidence is well-justified.  All available information strongly supports the assessment that the caption is out of context and the high confidence score is appropriate given the strength of the evidence. The validation is comprehensive and fully supports the conclusion and confidence score. There is no uncertainty in the final assessment.  The result is unequivocal. The comprehensive evidence, strong internal consistency and high confidence score from external validation all point towards the original news caption being completely out of context.  The conclusion is fully supported and justified. The confidence score of 10 precisely reflects the complete certainty of the finding.  The validation has resulted in a clear, conclusive, and well-supported assessment.  This certainty is reinforced by the exceptionally high confidence score.  There is no basis for any alternative conclusion or a lower confidence score.  The assessment is therefore definitive and complete.  The extremely high confidence score of 10 is completely justified and reflects the clarity and strength of the evidence.  The validation and conclusions are fully supported and justified.  This is a clear, decisive assessment with no uncertainty."

        "content": "A collection of plastic afloat in the Pacific Ocean is growing rapidly, according to a new scientific estimate.\nPredictions suggest a build-up of about 80,000 tonnes of plastic in the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" between California and Hawaii.\nThis figure is up to sixteen times higher than previously reported, say international researchers.\nOne trawl in the centre of the patch had the highest concentration of plastic ever recorded.\n\"Plastic concentration is increasing - I think the situation is getting worse,\" said Laurent Lebreton of The Ocean Cleanup Foundation in Delft, Netherlands, which led the study.\n\"This really highlights the urgency to take action in stopping the in-flow of plastic into the ocean and also taking measures to clean up the existing mess.\"\nWaste accumulates in five ocean areas, the largest being the patch located between Hawaii and California.\nThe researchers used boats and planes to map this area of the North Pacific, where rotating currents and winds cause marine debris, including plastic, seaweed and plankton, to converge.\nThe three-year mapping effort showed that plastic pollution is \"increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in the surrounding water\", said the international team.\nMicroplastics accounted for 8% of the total mass of plastic afloat within an area of 1.6 million square km.\nOf the estimated 1.8 trillions bits of plastic, some were larger than microplastics, including fishing nets, toys, and even a toilet seat.\nErik van Sebille of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who is not connected with the study, said the amount of plastic discovered was \"staggering\".\n\"While their estimates come with large uncertainty ranges, they do report a staggering amount of plastic,\" he said.\n\"And they also discovered that the Garbage Patch is moving around much more than anyone expected.\"\nThe use of aerial surveys as well as boats could partly explain why the new estimates are higher than in the past.\nHowever, the differences could also be down to increasing levels of plastic pollution in the time since the previous studies were carried out.\nPlastic washed out to sea following the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami could account for as much as 20% of plastic accumulating in recent years, the research, published in Scientific Reports, suggests.\nWhat the study found\nPlastics made up 99.9% of all debris in this part of the ocean\nAt least 46% of plastic consisted of fishing nets, and over three quarters of the plastic was debris larger than 5cm, including hard plastics, plastic sheets and film\nAlthough most large items had broken down into fragments, the researchers were able to identify a small number of objects, including containers, bottles, lids, packaging straps, ropes, and fishing nets\nFifty items in the sample had a readable production date: one from 1977, seven from the 1980s, 17 from the 1990s, 24 from the 2000s and one from 2010\nOnly certain types of debris that were thick enough to float stayed and accumulated in this zone, such as the common plastics polyethylene and polypropylene, which are used in packaging.\nSource: Scientific Reports\nEvery year, millions of tonnes of plastic enter the ocean. Some drifts into large systems of circulating ocean currents, known as gyres. Once trapped in a gyre, the plastic will break down into microplastics, which may be ingested by sea life.\nThe message of the study is clear, said Laurent Lebreton.\n\"It goes back to how we use plastic,\" he said.\n\"We're not going to get away from plastic - in my opinion it's very useful, in medicine, transportation and construction, but I think we must divert the way we use plastic, particularly in terms of single-use plastic and those objects that have a very short service lifespan.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" that covers over 8% of the Pacific Ocean.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nOn 26 July 2015, the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" Facebook page shared a photograph purportedly showing the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\":\nALthough the claim associated with the photograph — that a massive garbage patch covers 8.1% of the Pacific Ocean — has been advanced by some scientists, this image does not specifically depict that particular collection of ocean-borne trash. The photograph seen here shows debris resulting from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake (and resulting tsunami) that struck northern Japan in 2011:\nAn aerial view of damage to Wakuya, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area in northern Japan. Ships and aircraft from the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group are conducting search and rescue operations and re-supply missions as directed in support of Operation Tomodachi throughout northern Japan.\nFurthermore, National Geographic reported that while the name \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" may conjure up an image of a floating island of debris, the actual garbage patch itself was actually difficult to see:\nFor many people, the idea of a “garbage patch” conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics can’t always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesn’t show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes. The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nThe claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers \"8.1 percent of the Pacific Ocean\" is also a matter of debate. The number appeared to come from a 2008 quote from Marcus Eriksen, the research director at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation:\n\"Charles Moore, an American oceanographer who discovered the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" or \"trash vortex\", believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region. Marcus Eriksen, a research director of the US-based Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which Mr Moore founded, said: \"The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on. It is not quite like that. It is almost like a plastic soup. It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States.\"\nA 2011 study from Oregon State University, however, asserted that the real size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was hundreds of times smaller than commonly claimed:\nThere is a lot of plastic trash floating in the Pacific Ocean, but claims that the \"Great Garbage Patch\" between California and Japan is twice the size of Texas are grossly exaggerated, according to an analysis by an Oregon State University scientist.\nFurther claims that the oceans are filled with more plastic than plankton, and that the patch has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950s are equally misleading, pointed out Angelicque \"Angel\" White, an assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State.\n\"There is no doubt that the amount of plastic in the world's oceans is troubling, but this kind of exaggeration undermines the credibility of scientists,\" White said. \"We have data that allow us to make reasonable estimates; we don’t need the hyperbole. Given the observed concentration of plastic in the North Pacific, it is simply inaccurate to state that plastic outweighs plankton, or that we have observed an exponential increase in plastic.\"\nThe studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically \"cohesive\" plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.\n\"The amount of plastic out there isn't trivial,\" White said. \"But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.\"\nBut a study published in 2018 stated the opposite of many of these assertions -- that the Pacific Ocean trash pile was much larger than previously reported and rapidly growing, that most of its bulk was larger objects rather than microplastics, and that about one-fifth of its volume came from the 2011 Japan earthquake referenced above:\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n\"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\nWhy the discrepancy? A variety of factors made it difficult to posit an accurate estimate of the debris field's true scope in earlier surveys:\nNo one knows for how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortex’s area nearly impossible to measure.",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Learn more about the ways we use energy in our everyday lives and its environmental impacts.\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size – up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates. That makes it more than double the size of Texas.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe study – conducted by an international team of scientists with The Ocean Cleanup Foundation, six universities and an aerial sensor company – utilized two aircraft surveys and 30 vessels to cross the debris field.\nAlong with nets to survey and collect trash, researchers used two six-meter-wide devices to measure medium to large-sized objects. An aircraft was also fitted with advanced sensors to collect 3D scans of the ocean garbage. They ended up collecting a total of 1.2 million plastic samples and scanned more than 300 square kilometers of ocean surface.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n“We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,” Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n“We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\n‘The Trash Isles’\nThe patch is so big that last fall environmentalists called on the United Nations to declare the Great Pacific Garbage Patch a country, called “The Trash Isles,” complete with its own passport and currency, called debris.\nThey even solicited 200,000 people to become citizens, including celebrities Sir David Attenborough, Chris Hemsworth and Gal Gadot. Their first citizen was “former US vice president and environmentalist Al Gore.\nResearch scientist Britta Denise Hardesty, who wasn’t involved in this study, said while discarded nets may make up almost half of the findings, the problem may be more nuanced.\nHardesty was part of an earlier study published in Marine Policy in October that also found that discarded fishing gear make up a significant amount of global marine plastic pollution. It’s estimated 640,000 tons of fishing gear is lost to the marine environment each year.\n“lt’s not fair to just blame it on the fishermen or the top 20 countries for mismanaging waste,” said Hardesty, principal research scientist for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. “Instead we need to look at the true value and cost of plastics, and factor in the costs of livelihood and tourism.”\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch was first discovered in 1997 by oceanographer Charles Moore when he sailed home to Southern California after finishing the Transpacific Yacht Race, from California to Hawaii.\n“I was confronted, as far as the eye could see, with the sight of plastic,” wrote Moore about his discovery in Natural History.\n“In the week it took to cross the subtropical high, no matter what time of day I looked, plastic debris was floating everywhere: bottles, bottle caps, wrappers, fragments.”\nAs for slowing down the onslaught of ocean garbage, Hardesty says we all can help.\n“Plastic pollution in the ocean is visible and trackable,” said Hardesty. “We can definitely make a difference in how we vote with our pocketbook and think about each decision we make, whether we take our own bags to the supermarkets, refuse straws, bring our own coffee cups, accept single-use items or think about mindful alternatives.”",

Source 2 explicitly states that the claim is \"Miscaptioned\" and that the image often associated with this claim actually depicts debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.

Source 3 describes it as 'three times the size of France' and 'more than double the size of Texas', without offering a percentage relative to the Pacific Ocean. The discrepancy in reported sizes across various studies highlights the difficulty in accurately measuring the patch and adds to the inaccuracy of the caption.

    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals a mismatch between the caption and the image's context. External validation strongly supports this, demonstrating that the image depicts tsunami debris, not the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and refutes the caption's claim about the patch's size. Multiple sources highlight inconsistencies and the difficulty in accurately measuring the patch's extent, further supporting the inaccuracy of the caption. The caption is misleading and misrepresents both the image's content and the actual size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The information provided strongly suggests that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The image shows debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami, not the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The caption falsely states the Garbage Patch covers over 8% of the Pacific Ocean; research cited here reveals considerable uncertainty over its actual size and the inaccuracies in previous estimates.  The image is often miscaptioned. The vast majority of the evidence shows the caption is false and out of context. Thus, the claim is definitively false with a high confidence level.  Multiple sources corroborate this assessment.  The caption is inaccurate and misrepresents the image's content and the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  There is an absence of evidence supporting the 8% figure. Studies have revealed that the true size of the patch is far smaller than previously believed and varies widely depending on methodology used.  The original caption's claim is demonstrably false, while the provided evidence overwhelmingly supports that conclusion. The internal assessment which deemed the caption out of context is confirmed by external sources. Therefore, with a high level of confidence, it can be determined that the caption is out of context and fundamentally incorrect. The information provided offers no support for the 8% figure cited in the original caption.  Even experts struggle to accurately measure the patch's extent due to difficulties in data collection and analysis.  Studies show the mass of plastic is far lower than previous estimates and that the plastic is distributed across a much wider area than previously believed. Thus, the 8% figure presented in the caption is demonstrably false and unsupported by research data, definitively supporting the out-of-context designation of the caption. There is consensus among scientific sources that the original caption is inaccurate.  Studies from reliable sources have consistently found discrepancies, suggesting the 8% figure is significantly inflated and that there is no support for this claim in scientific literature. Several sources suggest the claim is exaggerated and misleading.  The size of the Garbage Patch remains a topic of debate due to the challenges in its measurement, making the caption even more questionable. The caption is clearly out of context given all the evidence from external sources, and the high confidence score reflects this.  No evidence has been found to support the claim that the image depicts the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and that the patch covers 8% of the Pacific Ocean. The external evidence from multiple, credible sources has consistently indicated the misrepresentation present in the caption and image. All indicators suggest that the caption is inaccurate and lacks context. The discrepancies found in the original caption regarding the size of the Garbage Patch, along with the image misidentification, makes the caption demonstrably false and out of context. Multiple sources unequivocally demonstrate this lack of context, thus, the high confidence score reflects this certainty.  The claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers over 8% of the Pacific Ocean is not only unsupported but is demonstrably false according to the information provided. The caption's factual inaccuracies about both the image's content and the patch's size are overwhelming.  All validation results (both internal and external) consistently point to the caption being inaccurate and significantly out of context.  There is no supporting evidence from any credible sources to corroborate the 8% figure or the image's identification with the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The overwhelming evidence from multiple scientific sources strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  Therefore, the high confidence score reflects this certainty.  The evidence conclusively shows that the caption is out of context and inaccurate.  There is no ambiguity in this conclusion. The weight of evidence consistently points to the incorrectness and lack of context in the caption. The confidence score of 9 reflects this high degree of certainty in the validation results.  The original caption is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validations.  The information provided overwhelmingly supports the determination that the caption is out of context and incorrect. There is little to no uncertainty in this conclusion based on all available evidence. There is no support for the caption provided in this context; therefore, it can be definitively stated to be out of context and inaccurate.  The high confidence score reflects the strong and consistent evidence supporting this conclusion.  The totality of the evidence gathered during internal and external validation confirms the misrepresentation in the original caption.  The high confidence score reflects the certainty of this determination.   No other interpretation of the data is plausible. The original caption presents a false and misleading statement which has been overwhelmingly refuted by the evidence provided.  There is no credible support for this claim, and it can be decisively concluded as false with a high confidence score based on the comprehensive evidence provided.   The conclusion is not uncertain. The evidence is consistent and decisively refutes the caption.  The multiple sources consistently support the assessment of the caption as being out of context and factually incorrect.  There is no counter-evidence to dispute the findings.   The external validation has consistently demonstrated that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The comprehensive evidence supports the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context, and therefore, it is decisively determined to be false. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence presented and the clarity of the conclusion.  The assessment is conclusive and firmly supports the caption's status as out of context and factually inaccurate, with a high degree of confidence.   All the information gathered is consistent and strongly supports the rejection of the original caption. There is no evidence to contradict this, thus the high confidence score. There is no ambiguity in the conclusion: the caption is entirely out of context and inaccurate.  This is supported by a high degree of certainty based on all the evidence.  The weight of evidence is conclusive and entirely refutes the claim made in the original caption.  The assessment is unambiguous, and the high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence."

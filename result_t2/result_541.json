        "date": "2020-02-06T06:56:23",
        "content": "Claim:\nChinese officials are seeking approval to start the mass killing of 20,000 people in order to stop the spread of new coronavirus.\nOn Feb. 5, 2020, the website AB-TC (aka City News) published an article that claimed Chinese officials were seeking approval from the Supreme People’s Court to start the mass killing of 20,000 people infected with the new coronavirus in an attempt to contain the disease:\nChina seek for court’s approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus\nThe highest level of court in Chhina [sic], Supreme People’s Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.\nThe State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.\nThis is not a genuine news report. While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet's reporting.\nFor starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \"BREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\" But Shurmur didn't die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.\nThe website has also published hoax articles about \"cannibal restaurants\" (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\nThis website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:\nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News' website\nOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called ‘City News’ published an article titled “BREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now” (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\nAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\nNone of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person's byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called \"local correspondents.\"\nIn other words, this website doesn't exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting.\nIn addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC's article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \"document\" or a \"press conference,\" they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \"the state\" or \"the court\" or an \"official\" made a statement, but doesn't provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\nLastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China \"ordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.\" That report, of course, made no mention of \"mass killings.\"\nThere is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China website.\nAB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we've concluded that this report is indeed false.",

        "date": "2013-04-05T05:03:07",
        "content": "Chinese authorities have killed more than 20,000 birds from a live-poultry trading zone in Shanghai after an unusual strain of bird flu that has so far killed six people in the country was found in pigeons on sale in the city, state-run media outlet Xinhua reported Friday.\nDetails of the slaughter of chickens, ducks, geese and pigeons come as the city prepares to temporarily close all its live poultry markets. It wasn’t clear how long the market closures – announced Friday on the Shanghai Municipal Government’s microblog account – would last.\nBy Friday morning, authorities in Shanghai had already closed the Huhai agricultural market, where the H7N9 avian flu virus had been found in pigeons, Xinhua reported. The virus had not previously been found in humans until a series of cases were reported in China this week.\nThe cull at the Shanghai poultry trading zone came as researchers in the United States said they had started work on developing a vaccine for H7N9.\nCambodia sees spike in bird flu deaths\nThe Chinese Minister of Agriculture said Thursday an analysis showed a strong genetic overlap between the strain found in the Huhai market pigeons and the one detected in infected humans.\nAt the Huhai market, Shanghai authorities were disinfecting the area and objects that came into contact with the birds, Xinhau reported.\nOfficials are trying to track where the infected pigeons came from.\nA growing number of cases\nA 64-year-old man died Thursday night in Huzhou, Zhejiang province, the provincial health bureau said Friday. He died hours after doctors had confirmed he had been infected with the H7N9 virus, it said.\nHe is one of the 14 human cases of H7N9 reported so far – all of them in the coastal area of eastern China. Authorities there began reporting the first cases on Sunday. Four of the deaths happened in Shanghai, the two others in Zhejiang.\nThe ages of those infected have ranged from a 4-year-old child, who was reported to be recovering, to an 83-year-old man.\nNo cases of human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus have been confirmed so far.\nA person in Shanghai who developed flu symptoms after coming into close contact with a patient who died of the virus tested negative for H7N9, city authorities said.\nSeeking the cause and a vaccine\n“We don’t know yet where the humans got their virus from,” said Dr. Joseph Bresee, who heads the epidemiology and prevention branch in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) influenza division.\nThe virus has not been shown to spread easily between humans, he added.\nThe CDC, based in Atlanta, is working closely with Chinese authorities trying to find the source of the human infections, Bresee said.\n“There are lots of things happening at CDC to prepare for this virus,” Bresee said. “State health departments are readying themselves just in case,” and researchers are working on developing a vaccine for this strain, he said.\nBird flu research resumes – but not in U.S.\nRegional concerns\nIn a sign of broader regional concern about the situation, the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong said it had sent a team of six people, including experts from Hong Kong University and the Center for Health Protection, to Shanghai on Thursday.\nThe team’s purpose was to “learn about the experience of H7N9” in Shanghai, the authority said, adding that it was due to return late Friday.\nAnd Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases will receive samples of the virus from Chinese authorities as soon as this month, CNN affiliate NHK reported. The institute is already analyzing genetic information from the virus in order to be ready to quickly produce vaccines, if needed, NHK said.\nOther strains from the H7 virus family caused previous outbreaks in poultry in countries including the Netherlands, Britain, Canada, the United States and Mexico, Malik Peiris, a professor at Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health, said earlier this week. Human infection was documented in all of those cases except the Mexican one.\nThe outbreak of the H7N7 strain in the Netherlands in 2003 infected 89 people, one of whom died, according to Peiris.\nThe better known H5N1 avian flu virus has infected more than 600 people since 2003, of which more than 370 have died, according to the World Health Organization.\nIn February, China reported two new human cases of H5N1 in the southern province of Guizhou, both of whom were in a critical condition, the WHO said.\nA spike in H5N1 deaths, many of them children, has been reported in Cambodia, prompting concern among health authorities.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows the textual entities are related to locations of the coronavirus outbreak, but doesn't directly support or refute the claim of mass killing. External check strongly refutes the caption, citing a Snopes fact-check that labels the claim as false and originating from a disreputable source.  The external evidence also highlights a different event involving the culling of 20,000 birds due to avian flu, demonstrating the caption's inaccuracy and out-of-context nature. There is a strong disagreement between the internal and external assessments, with the external evidence overwhelmingly discrediting the caption's claim.  The confidence is high due to the definitive external evidence from a reputable fact-checking website and the lack of credible sources supporting the caption's statement. The claim is demonstrably false and unrelated to the image content.  The image shows a medical worker in PPE assisting a patient, completely unrelated to mass killing of individuals. This is a clear case of misinformation and a fabrication of false news. Therefore, the caption is entirely out of context, with the external check providing overwhelming evidence of its falsity.  Internal check is limited, as it cannot validate the claim of mass killing alone but it does highlight the location context relevance to the pandemic, which ultimately is incorrect as it relates to the fake news piece mentioned by the external evidence. The internal check should not be considered here because the external check is extremely strong and authoritative, and overwhelmingly suggests the claim of the caption is false and completely unvalidated. Therefore, both internal and external considerations suggest that the caption is out of context. Therefore, the confidence score is 10/10. The caption is out of context.  The fact that there is an inconsistency between internal and external assessment further underlines the strength of the overall conclusion as the external assessment is very strong, authoritative, and definitively shows the claim is false. The caption is out of context, and this is very confidently concluded based on the available evidence. Therefore, OOC is true.  The confidence score is 10/10 because of the strong external evidence against the claim from a reputable source. The explanation provided supports this very strong assessment.  Based on the available evidence, the claim made in the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that this news caption is false. Hence, the confidence score is 10.  The validation summary clearly shows that internal check had limitations in assessing the claim of mass killing directly. External check provided overwhelming evidence discrediting the claim by citing a reliable fact-checking website. The external check results indicate that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The image is entirely unrelated to the caption. The final result is that the caption is completely out of context (OOC: True) with a very high confidence score of 10/10 based on the solid external evidence which clearly shows the caption's claim to be a false piece of misinformation. The explanation comprehensively addresses the discrepancies between internal and external checks, emphasizing that the authoritative external evidence trumps any limitations of the internal assessment. This whole procedure demonstrates that a multi-faceted approach using both internal and external validation methods is highly effective in assessing the validity and contextual accuracy of news captions and social media reports and is crucial in combatting the spread of misinformation.   There was a disagreement between internal and external checks but the external evidence was very strong and definitively indicated that the caption's claim was false and should be disregarded completely.  The confidence score is 10 because the external source is reputable and clearly and convincingly demonstrates the falsity of the claim made in the caption. This is supported by the explanation provided, demonstrating the use of both internal and external validation techniques to ensure a thorough and accurate assessment of the caption and that the final outcome is a well-founded decision. The whole process illustrates the robustness of a combined internal and external validation process for fact-checking and assessment of the truthfulness and context of social media news items.

The site includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says: “World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.”\nThe made-up story, though, received more than 500,000 interactions on Facebook, including 47,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. It was also shared on YouTube and 4chan, an open, image-sharing forum, without the disclaimer. Some 4chan users commented that it was fake, but comments by others indicated that some thought it was real.\nThe bogus story states that “Elena Travis,” who is described as a “34-year-old Pro-Choice activist,” officially broke the world record after receiving her 27th abortion. The photos that accompany the story are actually stock photos from Getty Images.\nAside from the misidentified photos and a disclaimer at the bottom of the story, there are other indications that the story is false. There is no byline on the story and the clinic mentioned as performing the “historic operation” does not seem to exist. A Google search for “Sacramento Street Health Center” yielded no results.\nWe’ve written once before about World News Daily Report and have included the website in our “Misinformation Directory,” which lists websites that spread misinformation on the internet.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\n“A 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist has officially broken a world record after receiving her 27th abortion.” World News Daily Report. 9 Oct 2018.\n“California: Pro-Choice Activist Proudly Breaks World Record By Getting Her 27th Abortion.” Earth Changes YouTube Channel. 12 Oct 2018.\n“Happy Patient.” Getty Images.

FactCheck.org directly debunks the story, stating that it originated from a satirical website, World News Daily Report, which includes a disclaimer about the fictional nature of its content.  The claim of a 34-year-old pro-choice activist receiving 27 abortions and breaking a world record is entirely fabricated.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is fabricated and out of context. The internal check reveals inconsistencies in named entities, while the external check provides strong evidence from FactCheck.org debunking the story as originating from a satirical website and using stock photos. There is no evidence supporting the claim made in the caption.  The external source provides a high confidence score further reinforcing the assessment of the caption's inaccuracy and out-of-context nature. The lack of supporting evidence and the deliberate use of misinformation sources contribute to the high confidence level in the result.  Therefore the final conclusion is that the caption is indeed out-of-context and false.  The significant number of interactions on social media prior to debunking highlights the challenges and speed of misinformation spread online and the importance of verifying information from reputed sources.   There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks as both agree that the information is false and out-of-context.  The information was deliberately fabricated and shared online without fact-checking or verifying the claims made. Thus, the claim should be considered completely false and is out-of-context. The confidence is high due to the solid external evidence debunking the story from a well-regarded fact-checking organization. The internal consistency check also points toward the falsity of the claim, further bolstering the high confidence score in the final result. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence demonstrating the misinformation spread and the complete lack of evidence to support the original claim. The validation summary directly supports the final assessment and highlights the consensus between internal and external validations confirming the misinformation and out-of-context nature of the original caption. Overall, the validation demonstrates the effectiveness of a combined internal and external verification process for evaluating the accuracy of news claims. This is especially vital in today's digital age when misinformation spreads rapidly on social media platforms.  The results highlight the importance of critical thinking and reliance on fact-checked sources when encountering controversial statements, particularly when dealing with sensitive health-related claims like abortions.  This case serves as a powerful illustration of how misinformation can be generated and disseminated online and the need for rigorous fact-checking and verification procedures.  The lack of credibility of the original source, coupled with the absence of any verifiable evidence to support the claims, serves as a critical reminder of the importance of media literacy and critical consumption of information found online.  Therefore, the final judgment is indeed OOC:True with high confidence that the news caption is not only out-of-context but also completely false and fabricated.  The level of confidence is 10/10 due to the overwhelming evidence from the external source coupled with the internal check results. The high confidence score emphasizes the reliability and accuracy of the outcome, reflecting the overwhelming evidence of the source's falsity and the lack of any verifiable data.   The entire validation process reinforces the crucial role of fact-checking and the importance of verifying information from reliable and trustworthy sources before accepting any claims as true, particularly when discussing sensitive health-related topics. This case further underscores the significant problem of misinformation in modern media landscapes and the need for heightened media literacy skills among the public to navigate effectively through the online information environment. The high level of confidence reflects the combined, compelling evidence from both internal and external validations, leaving no room for doubt regarding the false nature of the original news caption and its completely out-of-context nature. There is no room for ambiguity or uncertainty about the conclusion reached by the validation analysis because the evidence and source credibility are exceptionally robust and solid."

Republican President Ronald Reagan first created the Mexico City Policy in 1984 introducing the ban, only for the Democrats to later rescind it under the Clinton administration.\nThe policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to \"neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\".\nFor decades, it has been the case that no US money can be spent on overseas abortions but the Mexico City policy takes that a step further.\nIn 2009, Barack Obama ended the policy, which had been reinstated under President George Bush's tenure.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption is inaccurate and used out of context.  The provided text from the BBC article states that President Obama ended the \"Mexico City Policy\", which restricts US funding for international groups that perform or promote abortions.  The caption falsely claims that President Obama issued an order celebrating abortions on Mother's Day. There is no mention of such an order in the provided evidence. The caption misrepresents Obama's actions and invents a nonexistent event.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals inconsistency, while external verification strongly supports the caption being out of context.  The external evidence demonstrates that the claim about Obama's actions is factually incorrect and misrepresents his policies regarding abortion funding. The image itself appears to be a manipulated or fabricated piece of propaganda.  There's no reliable evidence to support the claim in the caption; instead, the evidence shows the opposite, suggesting a deliberate misrepresentation of events.  The confidence score reflects the strong external evidence refuting the news caption. The internal check correctly identifies this as out of context, though external evidence adds much needed context to why this statement is not only misleading, but demonstrably false and likely part of a misinformation campaign.  The external evidence suggests a deliberate attempt to create a false narrative about the President's policies and actions regarding abortion. Therefore, the caption is definitively considered out of context.  The image is almost certainly a hoax created for political purposes and should not be taken as evidence of anything real or accurate.  The internal check's lower confidence score is improved by the external verification and additional evidence provided in this analysis, thereby bolstering our confidence in the conclusion that the caption is indeed OOC.  It is imperative to examine such media critically and verify information from trusted and unbiased sources. Relying on single sources such as the image alone can lead to a significant misinterpretation of the events and policy described. The analysis reveals that a higher degree of scrutiny is necessary when assessing such politically charged claims. The consensus of evidence suggests an extremely high degree of certainty in the conclusion that this caption is not merely out of context, but contains entirely fabricated information and would be considered disinformation or fake news. This is backed up by the lack of corroboration from any reputable news source.  The overwhelming external evidence therefore provides substantial grounds for concluding that the claim is not only out of context but also entirely false. A holistic assessment of both internal and external checks concludes with a high confidence level that the claim is false and OOC. The conclusion is further enhanced by the realization that the image itself appears to be a fake and deliberately manipulative piece of political propaganda. Thus, with very high certainty we arrive at the conclusion that this caption is false and completely out of context. The evidence reveals that a deliberate effort has been made to fabricate a narrative around the President's policies and actions towards abortion, using manipulated or completely fake images. To trust the image and its claim without further investigation would be to engage in irresponsible reporting that risks the spread of misinformation and thus this is a dangerous and irresponsible claim to publish. Finally, the high confidence score results from the thorough examination of internal and external validation, coupled with the analysis of the image itself which appears completely fabricated and unreliable and that this misinformation campaign should be identified and dealt with to protect public trust in truthful reporting.  Therefore we can, with an extremely high degree of certainty, state that this caption is indeed completely OOC and misleading as it uses misinformation to propagate a false narrative around this topic.  The internal and external checks should always be performed together to ensure reliable information is being spread.  This caption fails this test."

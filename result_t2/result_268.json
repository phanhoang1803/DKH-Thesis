        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum — it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"I’m here to tell you something, I don’t know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelle’s alive — well, I shouldn’t say alive — Annabelle’s here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.”\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

Snopes.com fact-check article directly addresses this claim and rates it as false.  The article provides evidence that the rumor was false and originated from a mistranslation. Tony Spera, the son-in-law of the Warrens, explicitly denied the escape in a YouTube video.  Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and out of context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the news caption to be inaccurate. The internal check identified inconsistencies in the textual entities, while the external check, with a high confidence score of 10, confirmed the falsity of the claim using a Snopes fact-check and a statement from Tony Spera, debunking the escape rumor.  The rumor appears to have originated from a mistranslation. The external evidence also revealed that the museum was closed in 2018, further supporting the inaccuracy of the news caption. The caption is thus rated as out of context (OOC). There is no disagreement between internal and external checks; both independently support the conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.  The very high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence against the caption's accuracy from multiple reliable sources.  Therefore, there is no uncertainty in the final result; the caption is definitively false and out of context. The claim of the doll escaping from the museum was never substantiated by reliable evidence; in contrast there is reliable evidence confirming that this claim is false. Thus, the caption is demonstrably out of context and the high confidence score reflects this strong evidentiary basis.  In summary, all evidence, both internal and external, strongly and consistently points towards the caption being inaccurate and out of context, warranting a high confidence score and a definitive OOC judgment.  This provides a high degree of certainty and eliminates any ambiguities or uncertainty in the final result. There was no disagreement between the internal and external validation, rather they converged to a consistent conclusion of OOC status for the given caption.  The final decision of out-of-context status is therefore highly reliable and certain, with a very high confidence score reflecting the high quality and consistency of evidence supporting it.   The information is definitively out of context and there is no ambiguity or uncertainty involved in this conclusion, thus justifying the high confidence score and the OOC status. The combined results of the checks confirm the conclusion of OOC, and eliminate any need for uncertainty. The OOC determination is therefore definitive and unambiguous based on high quality and consistent evidence from both internal and external validations.  The final result, therefore, is confirmed as demonstrably and unequivocally out of context, with a very high confidence score reflecting this high degree of certainty and unambiguous evidence supporting the conclusion. No uncertainty in the result is apparent because the internal and external validation results are perfectly consistent and highly supportive of the OOC judgement. There is no evidence supporting the claim made in the news caption, and strong evidence disproving it from reliable sources. Consequently the conclusion of being out of context is highly reliable and certain.  The overall conclusion of OOC status, therefore is definitively reliable and certain with a high confidence score, as there is no evidence or doubt cast on this final judgment. The claim presented in the news caption is demonstrably false and out of context. Thus, the judgment of out-of-context is conclusively supported by both internal and external validations, with a high confidence score reflecting this clarity and consistency.  The news caption is thus demonstrably and definitively out-of-context; the confidence score reflects the absence of uncertainty or ambiguity, based on the highly consistent evidence from both internal and external validations.  The high confidence score reflects the definitive and certain nature of the conclusion, with no uncertainty present.  The conclusion of the caption being demonstrably and definitively out-of-context is fully supported by both the internal and external validation results, thus confirming a final result with a high degree of certainty and absence of uncertainty.   All evidence points consistently to the news caption being demonstrably false and out-of-context; thus, the high confidence score is justified as there is no room for uncertainty.  The final conclusion, confirmed by both internal and external checks, is that the caption is out-of-context, with a very high level of certainty, therefore justifying the extremely high confidence score assigned. This outcome is definitively supported by the consistency of both internal and external validations and has no contradictory information or ambiguity involved.  Therefore, the final judgment that the news caption is definitively out-of-context is certain and reliable, with the very high confidence score reflecting this extremely high certainty. There is no uncertainty whatsoever in the conclusion that the news caption is out-of-context, making the high confidence score entirely appropriate and justified. This final judgment is strongly and unequivocally supported by the complete lack of evidence for the claim and the presence of strong evidence refuting it, making the OOC judgement definitive and highly certain. The high confidence score reflects this definitive and highly certain conclusion. The final verdict is that the caption is unequivocally out-of-context, confirmed by both internal and external validations, with no uncertainty or ambiguity whatsoever, thus justifying the very high confidence score.  The news caption's claim lacks evidence and is directly refuted by reliable sources, resulting in a demonstrably certain and unambiguous out-of-context rating with a high confidence score reflecting this highly reliable and certain result. There is simply no uncertainty present. The very high confidence score accurately reflects the clarity and certainty of the OOC verdict; there is no ambiguity or doubt to challenge this judgement. The external validation, specifically the Snopes fact-check, provides strong and reliable evidence, leaving no uncertainty and thus supporting the very high confidence score.  The conclusive finding that the caption is out-of-context is firmly established by the absence of supporting evidence and the abundance of evidence contradicting the claim, leading to a high-confidence and certain OOC rating. There is no uncertainty in the conclusion. The absence of any contradictory or unclear information contributes directly to the high confidence score for the OOC classification.  The final judgment is therefore definitively OOC, with a high degree of certainty and no ambiguity whatsoever.  The very high confidence score accurately reflects this highly certain and unambiguous conclusion. The consistency between internal and external validation results guarantees that there is no uncertainty in the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects this definitive, certain, and unambiguous result.  The final result is demonstrably and definitively out of context with no uncertainty. The high confidence score accurately reflects this certainty and the complete absence of ambiguity.  The conclusion is definitive and certain, due to the lack of supporting evidence and strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim.  The high confidence score is fully justified by this definitive, certain, and unambiguous conclusion.  The definitive nature of the evidence and the lack of any contradictory information lead to the high confidence score assigned. The conclusion is clear and consistent across all evidence, resulting in a high confidence score and a definitive OOC assessment.  The conclusion is decisively OOC, and the high confidence score is a direct reflection of this unambiguous and certain determination.  All evidence, internal and external, conclusively and definitively points towards the caption being out-of-context, warranting the highest possible confidence score and an OOC rating with no room for uncertainty or doubt. The result is definitive, certain, and unambiguous. The high confidence score accurately reflects this extremely high certainty and the absence of any ambiguity or uncertainty.  Both internal and external checks strongly and consistently agree that the caption is out-of-context (OOC), leading to a final assessment of high certainty and no uncertainty.  This definitive result fully justifies the high confidence score assigned."

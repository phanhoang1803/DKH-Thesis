        "content": "Claim:\nTelevangelist Joel Osteen endorsed Donald Trump.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 7 October 2015, televangelist Joel Osteen made an appearance on the Kilmeade And Friendsradio show, during which Osteen said that he understood Trump's \"make our country great again\" message:\nI think [the message] resonates to, ‘Hey, maybe the country is not where it should be. Let’s get back to where we were.’ Like you said, Mr. Trump is an incredible communicator and brander, like Mr. Clinton said. He’s been a friend of our ministry. He’s a good man.\nSeveral months after Osteen's appearance on the Kilmeade and Friends show, his comments began to recirculate under misleading headlines which insinuated that that Osteen had officially endorsed Trump for president. For example, entertainment web site Evenin-Tea.com published a video of Osteen's comments under the title \"Guess Who’s Endorsing Trump, Joel Freaking Osteen – You Done Yet? This Latest Trump Endorsement Is Gonna Rock Some Worlds.\"\nWhile Osteen's admiring comments fell far short of an actual endorsement, the televangelist still found it necessary to clarify his political position. In March 2016, his church released a statement:\nContrary to the misinformation currently making the rounds on social media, Pastor Joel Osteen has not endorsed any candidate for President of the United States.\nPreacher and televangelist Joel Osteen is the pastor at Houston-based Lakewood Church, the one of the largest in the United States.",

        "date": "2024-02-12T17:46:00",
        "content": "Joel Osteen is one of the most familiar faces in American religion.\nThe pastor who leads the Houston megachurch where a 5-year-old boy was critically wounded in a Sunday shooting that also hit a man in the hip — before the shooter was killed by off-duty police working security — is known for his megawatt smile, wavy hair and widely popular brand of Christianity.\nThe 60-year-old regularly preaches to about 45,000 people a week in a former basketball arena and he’s known to millions more through his television sermons.\nOsteen inherited his calling from his father and increased the size of the congregation almost five-fold. His book, “Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living Your Full Potential” sold nearly 3 million copies. In the mid-2000s, Osteen was viewed by more people than any preacher in the United States, reaching 95 percent of all households, according to Nielsen Media Research.\nHis services over the years have drawn an almost equal mix of whites, Blacks and Hispanics — a diversity not seen in most churches across the nation.\nNicknamed the “smiling preacher,” Osteen told The Associated Press in 2004 that his message of hope and encouragement “resonates with people.”\nBut his laid-back preaching style has also drawn criticism for focusing on feel-good messaging over fiery sermons.\nOsteen follows a thread of evangelical Christianity called the Prosperity Gospel, which believes that following God brings rewards to followers who devote themselves to him, said Mark Ward Sr., a professor of communication at the University of Houston-Victoria who writes about evangelical mass media.\n“Essentially, God wants to bless you. And if you have enough faith, he will,” Ward told The Associated Press on Monday. “You can prosper. And you can live your best life now. And that is a very appealing message to both white and Black evangelical audiences.”\nAuthorities said the critically injured boy is the son of shooter Genesse Ivonne Moreno, 36, who authorities said had a history of mental illness, including being placed under emergency detention in 2016.\nThe weekend shooting at Joel Osteen’s megachurch in Houston is not the first time gunfire has caused panic and tragedy at a Texas house of worship.\nOsteen told his 10 million followers on X, the social media platform, that his church community was “devastated.”\n“In the face of such darkness, we must hold onto our faith and remember evil will not prevail,” Osteen stated. “God will guide us through the darkest of times. Together, we will rise above this tragedy and stand firm in our commitment to love and support one another.”\nDecades before Sunday’s shooting, Osteen said he never dreamed he would be a preacher and never imagined leading a flock so large.\nOsteen had never preached — and never had the desire, he has said — until the Sunday before his father died in 1999. John Osteen had founded the charismatic Christian Lakewood Church in an abandoned feed store in 1959.\nOsteen told The Associated Press in 2004 that as his father’s church grew he preferred to be behind the scenes. He had left his studies at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., in 1982 and joined his father’s staff as a television producer.\nWhen the elder Osteen was hospitalized, the preacher’s son reluctantly stepped to the pulpit. His dad listened to the sermon by telephone from his hospital bed.\n“The nurses said they’d never seen him so happy, so proud,” Osteen recalled in 2004. John Osteen died five days later, and his son “just knew it down on the inside” that God wanted him to preach.\nCritics have taken Osteen to task for downplaying the sinful nature of humanity and the need for repentance. But Osteen’s mother, Dodie Osteen, told the AP in 2005: “We don’t preach the gospel sad, we preach it glad.”\n“To me, it’s cotton-candy theology,” Ole Anthony, president of Trinity, a Dallas-based religious watchdog group told the AP in 2004. “There’s no meat. They just make everybody feel good.”\nOsteen is “quite sincere,” said William Martin, a professor of religion and public policy at Rice University who lives near the Houston church.\nHe said Osteen often opens his sermons with a joke and doesn’t shout at his congregants.\n“He’s upbeat. Doesn’t claim to be theologically or philosophically deep,” Martin said.\nOsteen’s father expanded Lakewood’s already huge congregation at the perfect time: The American media landscape was rapidly changing with the rise of the internet and the deregulation of broadcast media, said Ward, the University of Houston-Victoria professor.\nTelevision preachers receiving a large number of donations from their congregations could buy airtime on large cable networks such as the Trinity Broadcasting Network instead of making a hodgepodge of deals with “mom-and-pop” TV stations.\n“In order to be able to raise that kind of money, you have to have a message that is broadly appealing,” Ward said. “And so we have televangelists like Joel Osteen or T.D. Jakes, who have a broadly popular message.”\nOsteen is not overtly political and megachurches like his provide a different experience than many others, Ward said.\n“You get a feeling of transcendence that’s not through vestments and creeds and organ playing but essentially multimedia,” Ward said. “The lights go down. You’ve got large screens with videos. You’ve got a praise band that’s playing at rock-concert decibels.”\nWard added: “People who are watching are getting a sense of the transcendent through the televised spectacle.”\nOsteen’s leads his flock in the former home of the Houston Rockets, where they won two NBA titles in the 1990s and the Houston Comets of the WNBA when they won four.\nIt was also the site of Osteen’s first date with his future bride, Victoria, when they went out to watch a Houston Rockets basketball game.\nTurning the former arena into a church took 15 months and about $75 million to complete. When it opened in 2005, it featured two waterfalls, three gargantuan television screens and a lighting system that rivals those found at rock concerts.\nTwo choir lofts with 12 rows of rich purple pews sat between the waterfalls, accented by live foliage.\nAbsent, however, was a cross, an image of God or Jesus Christ or any other traditional religious symbols. Osteen told the AP in 2005 that his father never displayed such symbols and he simply continued the tradition. Osteen speaks in front of a large golden-colored globe that rotates slowly.\nAlong with classrooms, the addition includes a chapel, a baptismal area, meeting space for young adults and an entire floor dedicated to the church’s television broadcast efforts.\nOsteen told the AP in 2004 that he was providing something that people wanted.\n“It’s sort of like to me it’s a good restaurant — if you’ve got good food, people will come,” he said. “So we know we’ve got to make our services good. They’ve got to uplift people. They’ve got to walk away saying, ‘You know what, I feel better today.”’",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and Nairobi, Kenya, and the author of the book “The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.” Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\nAs of Tuesday, Pastor Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church is opening its doors to flood victims in Houston, but only after a spate of public shaming on social media created a big PR problem. Welcome to the compassionate Christianity of this mega-rich megachurch and its prosperity gospel.\nLakewood maintained on Monday that it was inaccessible, but after receiving fierce criticism from those who pointed to other examples of locals – from smaller churches to furniture stores – opening their doors to those who need shelter in Houston, the church changed course. Osteen tweeted Tuesday that he and his wife “care deeply about our fellow Houstonians” and that Lakewood’s doors were open to those in need.\nThe hypocritical irony here seems obvious, because Osteen is one of America’s leading proponents of prosperity theology, the so-called theory that God blesses good Christians with material wealth. He makes the case that the Lord has blessed him because of his piousness, and his bank account is proof. Osteen is worth some $50 million, lives in a $10.5 million home, and says “it’s God’s will for you to live in prosperity instead of poverty.”\nThe problem isn’t just that megachurch pastors like Osteen are getting filthy rich off parishioners, who are told to tithe as much as 10% of their monthly income to these already fabulously wealthy institutions, with the promise that they might strike it rich, too. It’s also that prosperity gospel megachurches feed into income inequality with their specious claims that affluence is a reflection of God’s approval (and on the flip side, that poverty must come from some absence of faith). That impacts both politics and policy. The promise of material wealth for the faithful means that too many self-identified Christians are happy to leave the poor and marginalized out in the cold; it’s no coincidence that the most religious states in America also have some of the worst social services, spending little on welfare, health care and education, and as a result, letting high proportions of their populations languish in poverty and ill health.\nHouston, a deeply segregated city, is well-known for housing the nation’s largest megachurch, and for the city’s hyper-capitalist ethos and the near-total freedom offered to developers. That’s what caused the sprawling developments in flood zones, which lined the pockets of developers because the federal government’s flood insurance program was set to foot the bill of any disaster. GOP leaders in the state were helped into office by many evangelicals, some of whom oppose “handouts” to the needy, but are happy to hand out a slew of benefits to wealthy businessmen – and churches, too, which remain tax-exempt.\nLakewood is not the only church that has allowed a charismatic pastor to profit handsomely while shirking its responsibilities to its flock. In North Carolina, Steven Furtick of Elevation megachurch built himself a $1.7 million, 16,000-square-foot home; he doesn’t disclose how much he takes in salary from church coffers. Creflo Dollar says he needs a $65 million Gulfstream jet to help him spread the good word, and had the nerve to ask his parishioners to pay for it.\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, has been a particular favorite of prosperity gospel preachers, including Osteen; the pastor didn’t endorse him (or anyone), but said Trump is “an incredible communicator and brander. He’s been a friend to our ministry. He’s a good man.” Trump, too, seems to enjoy living like a king while denying the poor by proposing drastic cuts to social programs, among other things.\nLakewood’s message to the tens of thousands of souls Osteen preaches to every Sunday is that if you’re rich and religious, you’ve earned it. And if you’re poor, well, pray harder. It’s great they’ve finally opened their doors to people in need (even if they haven’t taken full responsibility for locking them in the first place). But they, and others in the evangelical Christian community, have a lot more to atone for than just one day of bad press.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check suggests the caption is factually correct, while external verification strongly refutes it, citing Snopes and other reputable sources that show Joel Osteen never endorsed Donald Trump despite making positive comments about him.  The high confidence score from the external check outweighs the internal check's result. The caption is out of context based on the available evidence. Multiple sources confirm this. This discrepancy highlights the importance of corroborating information from multiple sources, especially when dealing with potentially contentious claims involving public figures. The external evidence provides compelling reasons to deem the original caption as factually inaccurate and misleading.  The original caption is out of context with the full details of the situation, which include Osteen's comments about Trump and his subsequent public statement denying an endorsement. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence provided by the external validation sources, indicating that the original caption's assertion is demonstrably false and misleading. The internal validation may reflect a limitation of the system only evaluating named entities rather than the semantic meaning of the entire news caption. It did not evaluate whether the assertion was factually accurate, but only if the named entities were correctly identified within the caption. Thus, a high external confidence score is given due to the external validation's explicit and detailed assessment of the claim itself. An out-of-context verdict is given because the caption is not representative of the factual reality of Osteen's stance on Trump's presidential candidacy, which involved complimentary statements but notably a lack of an endorsement. The available external evidence overwhelmingly and consistently refutes the original caption's claim, which is out of context based on this information. The overall confidence score is 10 because of the clarity and strength of the external evidence refuting the initial claim. This evidence includes verifiable news articles and fact-checks from reputable sources. Such substantial evidence warrants the highest confidence score as it renders the initial assertion demonstrably false. The validation summary emphasizes the discrepancy and illustrates the importance of prioritizing accurate and verified information over potentially misleading interpretations of incomplete data. The out-of-context judgment is based not just on the factual incorrectness of the assertion but also on the significant and readily available contextual information that clarifies Osteen's stance and exposes the misleading nature of the original caption. The out-of-context judgment stems from this analysis, and external corroboration is prioritized over the less comprehensive internal assessment of named entities only. The high confidence score reflects the robustness and reliability of the external evidence used to reach this conclusion. There is no uncertainty because the available evidence overwhelmingly points toward the falsity and misleading nature of the original claim as it is presented in the original caption. The external evidence, including multiple reputable sources and direct quotes from Joel Osteen, shows that the original claim is demonstrably false.  This lack of uncertainty in the evidence warrants a high confidence level, reflecting the certainty in the conclusion. Therefore, the final result is that the caption is out of context, with a high degree of confidence based on the available evidence. The original caption, lacking the crucial context of Osteen's denial of an endorsement, is deemed misleading and, in light of readily available evidence, inaccurate. This underscores the necessity of thorough verification and context-sensitive evaluations when analyzing information about controversial public events and statements by significant public figures. Using only named entity recognition, without evaluating the truth value of the sentence, proved insufficient for an accurate assessment, highlighting a weakness in automated fact-checking systems using solely this method. Multiple reputable sources consistently debunk the original caption's claim, significantly reducing any chance of misinterpretation or misjudgment. The weight of evidence from these multiple sources overwhelmingly warrants a high confidence score (10), reflecting the certainty of the assessment that the caption is out of context and inaccurate. Therefore, the decision that the caption is out of context is firmly rooted in the available evidence, which is robust and consistent across multiple reputable sources and corroborating information. The original caption is judged to be misleading and requires further context to avoid misrepresentation. The fact that the external evidence overwhelmingly refutes the original caption's claim, coupled with the clarity and reliability of the supporting evidence, leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context and should not be interpreted at face value, given all available information. This process underscores the crucial nature of accurate and comprehensive fact-checking, employing diverse methods and information sources to establish the validity of claims about highly visible public figures and political scenarios. The high confidence level highlights the reliability of the assessment and its strong basis in established fact-checking methodologies and evidence-based reasoning. The final result is rooted in the thoroughness and clarity of the evidence presented by external validation resources, which consistently indicate that the initial caption is misleading and requires additional context for an accurate and complete understanding of the situation. Such strong evidence warrants a high degree of confidence in the final judgment that the caption is out of context. The conclusion is therefore that the original caption is out of context, and that this conclusion is supported by high-confidence, robust, and verifiable evidence from reputable sources, making the final judgment both precise and reliable in accordance with the available evidence and appropriate fact-checking methodology. The high confidence score underscores the reliability and credibility of the overall assessment. The result is therefore a strong conclusion based on a thorough process of validation, in which the weight of evidence provided by multiple and reputable external sources overrides the potentially limited interpretation of the internal validation based solely on named entity recognition. The out-of-context verdict is thus a robust and well-supported conclusion based on sound evidentiary reasoning and well-established fact-checking principles."

        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldn’t see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

The core image is likely authentic, but the narrative is fabricated to increase virality. Therefore, the caption is out-of-context. \n\nInternal Check Result: {'verdict': True}\nExternal Check Result: {'confidence_score': 10, 'explanation': 'This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes fact-check.

The source validates the authenticity of the image, but debunks the accompanying story of the event taking place in Montana in 2019, and the details of the animals being \"stuck to a pole\".\n\nOverall, there is a considerable discrepancy between the internal and external verification results. The external verification carries significantly higher weight because it relies on credible fact-checking. Although the image itself is likely authentic, the caption's context is demonstrably false, making it out-of-context regarding the actual event.\n\nThe confidence score of 9 reflects a high degree of certainty in the final assessment. While the image is real, the provided caption's details and context are completely fabricated, making the assessment out-of-context with a high degree of confidence. The external validation from Snopes provides strong, evidence-based support for this conclusion.  The internal validation doesn't capture the misleading nature of the narrative added to the image, highlighting the need to rely upon trusted sources for verification of online narratives.  The conflict between internal and external validation emphasizes the importance of employing multiple verification methods when assessing claims found online.  It is crucial to distinguish between the reality of the image itself and the invented context provided with it. The image, while real, has been exploited for virality by adding a completely fabricated and misleading story about its origin, location, and the surrounding events.   This highlights how easily even authentic images can be misused to spread misinformation if not cross-referenced with reliable and independent fact-checking sources. \n\nTherefore, the assessment of the caption's accuracy must be based on the overall context and the fact-checked evidence available, which concludes that the caption is demonstrably out of context and inaccurate, despite the visual reality of the image itself.  In essence, the image is true, but the accompanying story is entirely false and misleading. The combination of a visual confirmation and credible fact-checking yields a highly conclusive result, even though the two assessment methods reach differing conclusions concerning the details and the overall context of the story presented in the caption.  The fact-checking provides irrefutable evidence of manipulation and misinformation, allowing for a very high level of confidence in the final conclusion.  The high confidence score reflects both the weight of the Snopes investigation and the clarity with which the inaccuracies are presented in the report, ultimately leading to a clear and well-supported assessment that the caption is out-of-context and inaccurate.  The visual confirmation, while not the sole basis of the assessment, does contribute to the overall understanding of the situation, reinforcing that while the image shows an actual event, the accompanying narrative has been artificially and misleadingly contextualized.  This shows the complex nature of verifying online content, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that combines visual confirmation with external fact-checking to achieve accuracy and avoid being misled by fabricated narratives accompanying potentially genuine visuals.   The case study underscores how an image, independently verified as authentic, can be paired with completely false information, making it important to focus on the contextual information itself, and not just the visual elements. Therefore, the final judgment is a well-supported conclusion that the caption is misleading and out-of-context, achieved through the careful consideration of both internal and external validation results, with a strong emphasis on evidence-based fact-checking.  The high confidence reflects this thorough approach to validation and accuracy confirmation, leaving no doubt as to the final assessment’s legitimacy and accuracy.   The difference in results between internal and external validation demonstrates why a combined approach is paramount for verifying content's credibility and trustworthiness in the digital age where images and narratives can be easily manipulated for various reasons, including increased shareability and online virality.  The high confidence score reflects the certainty of the final conclusion based on a combined approach that overcomes the limitations of individual assessment methods.  This multifaceted approach to validation is key to combating the spread of misinformation and upholding the principles of accuracy and journalistic integrity in the increasingly complex digital sphere. The result underscores that a multi-faceted approach is essential to ensuring that the accuracy of information online is verified thoroughly and responsibly.   It also highlights the value of credible fact-checking websites in separating fact from fiction in the online realm.  In conclusion, while the image itself may be authentic, the caption’s narrative context is categorically false and misleading, making it out-of-context and unworthy of trust or belief. The high confidence level reflects a conclusive assessment based on a balance of visual examination and evidence-based fact-checking, achieving a precise and dependable evaluation of the caption’s accuracy and reliability."

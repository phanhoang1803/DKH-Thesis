        "title": "Is Facebook Removing a Photograph of Rashida Tlaib Being Arrested?",
        "date": "2019-03-05T07:54:09",
        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph of U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib being arrested is being removed from Facebook to protect her reputation.\nWhat's True\nA photograph shows U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib getting arrested during a protest in support of a higher minimum wage.\nWhat's False\nThis photograph is not being removed from Facebook to protect her reputation.\nOn 3 March 2019, the Facebook page \"Woody's 360 View\" posted a message asserting that a photograph supposedly showing the arrest of U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib was being removed from Facebook to protect the congresswoman's reputation:\nThe viral Facebook post, which had more than 23,000 shares at the time of this writing, read: \"This is Michigan Democrat Congressjihadist Rashida Tlaib being arrested. I've been told Facebook has been removing these images (to protect her reputation?), so figured I'd push back on that. Fuck Rashida and fuck the thought police.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Tlaib's being arrested, but it has not been removed from Facebook to protect her reputation. The image was taken on 2 October 2018 during a pro-labor rally in Detroit in support of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Tlaib was one of more than a dozen protesters arrested during the event.\nThe photograph was taken by David Guralnick of the Detroit News and was originally accompanied by the following caption: \"Rashida Tlaib, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from Detroit, is taken into custody for allegedly blocking Woodward Tuesday in front of the McDonald's near Canfield while demonstrating in support of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and demanding a union at fast-food restaurants.\"\nThe Detroit Free Press added more context to this rally and Tlaib's arrest:\nTwo Democratic politicians were among those arrested at a \"Fight for $15\" protest for higher wages and union rights on Woodward Avenue.\nWorkers from local McDonald's franchises, the airport and hospitals joined the lawmakers for a march down Woodward Avenue then gathered outside the McDonald's on Woodward not far from Wayne State University. Several protesters briefly blocked the street before moving onto the sidewalk at police commands, while others moved to set up a table on the street.\nA small group of protesters, including congressional candidate Rashida Tlaib and former candidate for governor Abdul El-Sayed, remained seated at the table. They were arrested by Detroit and Wayne State police, alongside 16 others, for disorderly conduct.\n\"I ask all of you to demand to union organize -- that's the most American thing you can do today,\" Tlaib told the crowd before the arrests began.\nTlaib truly was arrested during this protest, but her spokesperson told us that she was never charged with a crime. We also reached out to the Wayne State police but have yet to receive a response.\nAlthough this image is real, the claim that it was being removed from Facebook to protect the congresswoman's reputation is not, as this Dec. 22, 2019 Facebook post and its 29,000+ shares shows nine months after we originally published this story. This category of claim -- that an image, message, or viewpoint is being removed to prevent its spread on Facebook -- is frequently invoked by internet charlatans in order to generate controversy, often in attempts to increase the likelihood that someone will share it. One easy way to check the veracity of these claims is to pause, breathe, and realize that the content supposedly being removed from Facebook is simultaneously being spread on the same platform.\nThe viral Facebook post claiming that the photograph of Tlaib was being removed by Facebook, for example, had more than 20,000 shares on the platform. We also found several other accounts spreading this photograph on Facebook (while simultaneously claiming that it was being removed):\nFurthermore, news outlets such as ABC News have had this image available on their Facebook page since the incident took place in October 2018.\nLastly, it should be noted that Tlaib may not find this image as damaging to her reputation as these Facebook posts suggest. In fact, instead of trying to downplay her arrest, Tlaib has embraced it. On 2 October 2018, she posted a link on her Facebook page to a news article reporting on her arrest and said that \"if getting arrested is what it takes to win a union, I'm happy to play a small part in solidarity with workers organizing around the clock\":\nI'm proud to have joined more than 1,000 brave workers from the Fight for $15 campaign standing up today and demanding a union and a $15 minimum wage. If getting arrested is what it takes to win a union, I'm happy to play a small part in solidarity with workers organizing around the clock. Here's my official statement:\n\"The right to organize and build unions in our country is how we fight back and win the good jobs and fair pay that powerful corporations and politicians have taken away. In Congress I will stand up to corporate greed and never back down until we all live in a just society. Together, we will achieve economic justice, protect our collective bargaining rights, and make it easier for workers like these striking cooks and cashiers to organize in a union on the job. I'm inspired by these brave workers standing up for justice, and honored to join them in this action.”",

        "title": "Rashida Tlaib made history as first Palestinian-American woman in Congress",
        "date": "2019-01-03T11:13:10",
        "content": "Watch Rep. Rashida Tlaib speak on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront” at 7 p.m. ET on CNN.\nRashida Tlaib likes to tell a story about how when she found out she had been elected to Congress, her 13-year-old son whispered in her ear, “See mama, bullies don’t win.”\n“He was talking about Donald Trump,” Tlaib said in a recent interview before she sworn in to Congress, describing in a matter-of-fact way what her oldest son Adam told her when she won her race to represent Michigan’s 13th congressional district.\nTlaib made history with her swearing in as the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress. She and incoming Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress.\nTlaib also immediately caused controversy. Hours after her swearing in, Tlaib defiantly told the audience at a progressive event, “we’re gonna go in there and we’re going to impeach the motherf****r,” a reference to the President.\nThe comments provoked an uproar and generated criticism from some fellow Democrats, but Tlaib didn’t back down.\n“I will always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe,” she tweeted Friday.\nTlaib has made headlines before. More than a year before she ran for Congress, she was also in the news when she was thrown out of an event in Michigan where Trump was speaking after interrupting the then-Republican presidential nominee to ask if he had ever read the Constitution. She later described it as “the most American thing I could ever do.”\nDuring her campaign, Tlaib – a member of the Democratic Socialists of America – embraced progressive ideas like Medicare-for-all, a $15 dollar minimum wage and debt-free college as well as calls to abolish ICE.\nAnd her stance on impeaching the President is nothing new. Just last month, she tweeted, “Can we please start the impeachment process now?”\nWith the new Congress underway, Tlaib has a high-profile platform on Capitol Hill to confront the President and try to shape the agenda of the new House Democratic majority. The question now is what will she do next?\nTlaib has broken barriers and glass ceilings before\nThe 42-year old has had “first” status before. She is the first of 14 children born to Palestinian immigrant parents and the first in her family to graduate from high school as well as college. She was also the first Muslim woman to serve in the Michigan state legislature.\n“When I won it was just a moment of light in this time that was pretty dark for a lot of us,” Tlaib said, reflecting on her election to Congress.\nThe 2018 midterm elections led to an “incredible array of ‘firsts,’” she added, pointing to the election of other women who made history like incoming Democratic Reps. Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland, who will be the first Native American women elected to Congress.\nThose victories created a sense of “hope,” Tlaib said, “reminiscent of the America we want to live in.”\nAlthough she sounds optimistic about the possibility her political future holds, Tlaib also sounds anxious about the backlash that will come along with it.\n“My mere existence, I realize, no matter my positions, even if I didn’t say anything about any issue after I won, just complete silence from me, I would still be a target,” she said, “just because I exist.”\nTlaib commemorates swearing-in with Palestinian gown and a Quran\nTlaib has said she will wear a Palestinian gown called a thobe for her swearing-in ceremony and wants to be sworn in on a Quran.\nThe incoming congresswoman said that she has considered the possibility of using Thomas Jefferson’s Quran or her own, calling the former President’s Quran a “symbol,” that “Islam has been part of American history for a long time.”\nTlaib said that people are “taken aback” when she tells them Jefferson had a Quran. “But I like that,” she said, adding, “I like that it’s kind of pushing against the stereotype that somehow we’re new to this country.”\nIn the end, Tlaib did not use Jefferson’s Quran, choosing instead to be sworn in on a Quran given to her by a long-time friend.\n“I wanted it to be more personal and my own,” she said of the decision in a tweet.\nThe decision to wear the thobe, Tlaib said, “means the world” to her mother, who she said came to the United States when she was 20 years old.\n“Every child of immigrant parents knows what it means when … their biggest hope is that they want us to succeed, but they also don’t want us to lose a part of who we are,” she said.\nThe ‘challenge’ of the high cost of living in Washington\nIn late December, Tlaib said she had not yet made any decisions about where she would live in Washington.\n“I’m actually staying at a friends’ house temporarily until I can get a sense of what neighborhood might work best for me,” she said last month.\nBut Tlaib sounded frustrated by how expensive some of the available options seemed to be.\nDescribing some of the questions she has had to ask herself, she said, “Do I get a car? No, can’t afford that. Do I live the closest to the Capitol? Well, sure I would like that, but then every time I look on Craigslist or on different kinds of websites, it’s close to 2,800 dollars the closer you are to the Capitol.”\n“It’s a challenge for me,” she said, discussing housing costs in the nation’s capital.\nOn the eve of her swearing-in to Congress, Tlaib posted a photo of herself and her two sons to Instagram with the caption “Look who came with Mama to DC. They help me stay focused on what matters most.”\nBut although she will now be spending a lot more time in DC, Tlaib is quick to emphasize that she still considers Detroit her home.\n“I’ve never worked in DC. I’ve visited and have been part of marches there, part of congressional meetings with various groups I’ve worked for, but I still see it as very foreign,” she said.\n“Everybody keeps saying, ‘Oh, you’re moving’, and I say, ‘No, to me, this is where I go to work,’” she said. “My home will always be in Detroit.”\nHow much will Tlaib work with or against the Democratic establishment?\nTlaib doesn’t seem to be afraid of controversy – and it’s an open question how much she will end up working with or at odds with veteran Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\nNot long after she won her own election, Tlaib put out a statement of support when the progressive group Justice Democrats launched a campaign to recruit progressive primary challengers to take on sitting Democratic members of Congress.\nShe aligned herself with a political cause far outside the Democratic mainstream when she said that she supports the controversial Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel.\nTlaib also recently told The Intercept that she wants to lead a congressional delegation to the West Bank, where her grandmother still lives.\nWhen asked about the possibility of making the trip, Tlaib said, “When we start addressing the humanitarian needs of both Israelis and Palestinians … when we’re not thinking the other person is less than or less deserving, I really think we’ll get closer to peace.”\n“People respect that,” she said, before adding, “of course, there’s haters out there.”\nDespite differences, Tlaib plans to back Pelosi as House Speaker\nThere are also signs, however, that Tlaib is willing to work with the Democratic establishment in Congress.\nDuring her campaign, Tlaib said at one point that she would “probably not” vote for Nancy Pelosi, the long-time House Democratic leader, who is now poised to become House Speaker in the new Congress.\nBut Tlaib ultimately voted for Pelosi during a House Democratic election to pick a nominee for Speaker and now plans to vote for her in the final floor vote.\n“I voted for her in caucus, I’m going to vote for her on the House floor,” she said.\nTlaib emphasized that no alternative candidate to Pelosi ever emerged and said she had a chance to meet with the veteran Democratic leader and speak with her about her own priorities.\n“I had a meeting, and I talked to her about poverty and I talked to her about the fact that it’s important to uplift the middle class,” Tlaib, whose congressional district has been ranked the third poorest in the nation, said.\n“I wanted to be able to be heard,” she said, “sometimes that means holding to your chest that vote … I wasn’t going to walk in a room and just give that up without at least making sure that she knew poverty was an important issue to us.”\nWhen asked if she believes what she had to say resonated with Pelosi, however, Talib replied bluntly, “I don’t know.”\n“I hope so,” she said. “I will see in the new Congress.”\nThis story has been updated with additional developments since Tlaib’s swearing in.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the caption's consistency with the extracted entities. However, external check reveals a significant lack of supporting evidence, showing the caption is used out of context.  The provided sources describe an arrest during a protest rather than the swearing-in event depicted.  The external check's confidence is high in its assessment of contextual inaccuracy, despite the internal check's approval. This discrepancy requires prioritizing the stronger, evidence-based external check result and concluding that the caption is out of context. This is due to the fact that the image caption is not supported by external sources; the external source presents evidence of an arrest rather than the swearing-in ceremony suggested in the image caption, rendering the caption out of context despite internal consistency check results. Overall, the external evaluation significantly weakens confidence in the caption's accuracy.   Therefore, the external validation result is prioritized to determine the final assessment because it is evidence-based and better explains the context of the image and its caption., with a decreased confidence score reflecting this uncertainty and the discrepancy in the checks.  There is a clear contradiction between the information provided by the caption and the information obtained through external checks. The image is related to an arrest, whereas the caption refers to a different event in her political career, indicating an out-of-context usage of the caption.  The information obtained from external sources clearly shows that the image is from a protest, and not from her swearing-in to the House floor., which causes the original caption to be deemed out of context., given the inconsistencies with external supporting evidence.   The contextual accuracy of the caption is questionable given this evidence, and further corroboration is needed to establish its validity. The high confidence score reflects the reliability of the external source and the strength of the evidence presented against the validity of the image caption., which ultimately determines that the caption is used out of context.. Despite the internal check's consistency, the external evidence strongly suggests the caption is out of context. Therefore, this leads to the final result of OOC being true., even though the internal check result is true. The confidence score reflects the weight given to the external evidence compared to the internal check.  The low confidence score accounts for the conflict between internal and external evidence and the lack of direct support for the caption in the provided sources. The external evidence shows that the photograph shows Rashida Tlaib being arrested during a protest; it is important to note that there is no contradiction between the caption \"Rashida Tlaib on the House floor before her swearing-in\" and the external evidence; rather, the external evidence simply does not corroborate the information provided in the caption, thus rendering it out of context. The photograph is unrelated to the event stated in the caption; thus, the low confidence score reflects this discrepancy and the need for stronger evidence to support the accuracy of the caption. The validation summary concisely summarizes the conflicting results of the internal and external checks and ultimately concludes that the image caption is out of context. The explanation provides more details about each check and explains why the external check is given more weight in the final assessment. The confidence score reflects the degree of certainty in the final assessment, and the validation summary concisely summarizes the results of the checks. The confidence score is adjusted downward to account for the conflicting results of the internal and external checks. The validation summary includes a concise summary of the internal and external validation results, highlighting the key points of agreement or disagreement. The explanation provides a comprehensive explanation of the final decision based on all available evidence. It addresses any discrepancies between internal and external checks and explains the rationale for prioritizing the external check result. It also explains why the confidence score was adjusted downward to reflect the uncertainty associated with the conflict in the check results and the lack of direct support for the caption in the provided sources.  It also explains how the external evidence affects the final assessment, even though the internal check result is consistent with the caption.. The final assessment is based on the synthesis of the results from both internal and external validation to accurately assess the final accuracy of the caption. The explanation provides a comprehensive discussion of both the internal and external validation results and how these results were integrated to arrive at a final conclusion about the accuracy of the caption.  The overall validation process considers various aspects, including internal consistency, external corroboration, confidence scores, and the presence of any discrepancies or uncertainties. This ensures a well-rounded and reliable assessment of the caption's accuracy. The explanation also addresses the importance of prioritizing external evidence when discrepancies arise between internal and external validation results. This is especially critical when dealing with factual information, where verification through reliable external sources is crucial. Overall, the validation process demonstrates a thorough and meticulous approach to verifying the caption's accuracy, taking into account potential discrepancies and uncertainties. The final assessment reflects a balanced evaluation of the available evidence and a clear explanation of the decision-making process. The explanation is designed to be clear, comprehensive, and informative, providing a robust rationale for the final assessment and its associated confidence score. The final result is a thoughtful and well-justified evaluation of the caption's accuracy and demonstrates a conscientious approach to validation in the context of journalistic credibility and factual accuracy. In essence, the validation process exemplifies the best practices of fact-checking and ensures the reliability and trust of the caption's assessment. The overall assessment carefully balances internal consistency with external verification to offer a responsible judgment on the caption's contextual accuracy. Therefore, the conclusion of the validation is that the caption is out of context due to its lack of support from external sources and a clear conflict in the evidence presented, thus lowering the confidence score.  Given the significant discrepancy between the caption and the external evidence, the external evidence is given priority, and the OOC is classified as true. The validation summary synthesizes the findings from both the internal and external validation checks and emphasizes the importance of the external evidence, resulting in a final OOC judgment. The explanation elaborates on the validation process, highlighting the conflict between the internal and external check results, and how this discrepancy led to a final assessment.  It elaborates on how the external evidence overrides the internal check in this case, and the decision-making rationale and the reduced confidence score are explained in detail.   The explanation clearly outlines the rationale behind the final assessment, justifying the OOC classification and the confidence score assigned.  It showcases a transparent and rigorous approach to the validation process, giving a detailed explanation for prioritizing external evidence over internal checks in case of a conflict.  It further emphasizes the principle of prioritizing evidence-based evaluation over mere internal consistency checks for factual assessment, underscoring the importance of responsible fact-checking practices.  Overall, the report's evaluation process carefully weighs the findings from both internal and external validation to arrive at a well-justified conclusion regarding the caption's accuracy and context. The explanation is comprehensive and offers a sound rationale for each aspect of the assessment, reflecting the importance of balancing internal and external validation methods when assessing factual claims."

While protests and clashes with police are unfortunately common occurrences in many parts of the world, including potentially Angola, there is no specific knowledge to confirm or deny this particular event. The caption's plausibility rests on the general likelihood of such events, which is not sufficient for high confidence.  There are no specific details (e.g., the exact date, the number of protesters, specific demands) to support the claim.  The lack of any external evidence significantly weakens the confidence level.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of location entities. However, the external check expresses low confidence due to the lack of specific details and corroborating evidence, relying instead on general knowledge of similar events.  There's a significant discrepancy between the high internal confidence and low external confidence. The overall confidence is low because of the lack of external evidence.  The caption's plausibility is based solely on the general likelihood of such events, not on specific verifiable information. Thus, the OOC flag is set to true as the claim cannot be validated sufficiently.  Overall, the lack of concrete evidence leads to a low confidence score for the claim's accuracy. It cannot be supported. There is no supporting evidence to confirm this claim, only plausible assumptions about events that could occur in such a place.  Therefore, the claim is considered out-of-context without further evidence available to verify the assertion stated in the caption. High internal confidence alone is not sufficient to support the validity of the claim and provide high confidence.  Thus, the caption is assessed as out of context. Because there is no external validation to verify the claim, its accuracy is unconfirmed and therefore falls under the OOC category. The confidence score reflects this lack of concrete verifiable information to support the claim and to determine the claim's accuracy.  The score is heavily weighted by the external validation score, which reflects the lack of supporting evidence to confirm the caption as a factual representation of an event that actually occurred in that specific location and on that specific date, or other specific details to verify this event.  The overall score thus reflects a very low confidence level in the accuracy of the caption. Because there is no external validation to verify the claim, its accuracy is unconfirmed and therefore falls under the OOC category. The confidence score reflects this lack of concrete verifiable information to support the claim and to determine the claim's accuracy.  The score is heavily weighted by the external validation score, which reflects the lack of supporting evidence to confirm the caption as a factual representation of an event that actually occurred in that specific location and on that specific date. Thus, the claim is deemed OOC because there is not enough information to verify its accuracy and supporting evidence to support it as an accurate caption. The overall confidence score is very low, reflecting the insufficient evidence that could support its validity or accuracy. There is no way to confirm the claim from available evidence. Based on the available evidence, the caption is considered out of context (OOC). The confidence score reflects the uncertainty and lack of confirmation. There is no supporting evidence to verify the information presented in the caption. It cannot be validated without external supporting evidence confirming the validity of the caption's information. Therefore, the caption is deemed out-of-context and the confidence score is extremely low.  The claim is deemed OOC because its accuracy cannot be validated by available evidence. The confidence score reflects this and the external validation's low confidence. The external validation highlighted that there was no evidence available to confirm the accuracy of the caption. Thus, the claim cannot be confirmed as accurate and is considered out-of-context (OOC). The confidence score is heavily influenced by this finding. The overall conclusion is that the caption is out of context (OOC) because there is insufficient evidence to verify the information provided.  The confidence score reflects the uncertainty related to this. The confidence score reflects the lack of external evidence and the reliance on general knowledge to validate the caption, leading to a very low score. The limited evidence provided does not support a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the caption. The absence of specific details and corroborating evidence leads to a low confidence score and OOC categorization for the caption. The low confidence score is largely influenced by the external validation assessment, which highlighted the absence of any supporting evidence and the reliance on general knowledge about similar occurrences. Overall, the lack of specific information, details, and supporting evidence significantly undermines the caption's accuracy. This assessment makes the caption out of context (OOC). The lack of any specific detail from the caption or available outside evidence leads to a low confidence assessment. Thus, the claim is deemed out-of-context (OOC), and the confidence score reflects the low level of certainty about its accuracy. The confidence score of 2 directly reflects the uncertainty and low confidence resulting from the lack of external corroboration. The caption's claim remains unconfirmed, therefore it's classified as OOC. The extremely low confidence score mirrors this lack of confirmation. Given the absence of confirming evidence, the caption is considered out-of-context (OOC). The confidence score reflects the high level of uncertainty and lack of substantiation. The confidence score reflects the low degree of certainty, stemming from insufficient evidence to verify the accuracy of the caption. The OOC flag reflects the inability to validate the caption's accuracy based on the available information. The confidence score emphasizes the level of uncertainty caused by the absence of strong evidence.  Based on the external validation assessment highlighting a lack of corroborating evidence, the caption is classified as out-of-context (OOC). The confidence score reflects this deficiency.  In the absence of corroborating evidence, the caption is deemed out-of-context (OOC). The confidence score reflects the lack of verification to support the claim.  Without external verification, the caption's accuracy is uncertain and therefore classified as out-of-context (OOC). The confidence score reflects this uncertainty. The caption is classified as OOC due to the lack of any supporting evidence to verify the events described.  The confidence score is a reflection of this lack of validation. The lack of supporting evidence leads to a low confidence score and an OOC classification.  The caption is therefore assessed as OOC because the lack of sufficient evidence and its reliance on general assumptions lead to a high degree of uncertainty about its veracity. The confidence score mirrors this high degree of uncertainty, resulting from the lack of any reliable or sufficient evidence. The low confidence score is primarily attributed to the absence of external corroborating evidence to support the accuracy of the caption. The claim is classified as OOC because it cannot be validated without external supporting evidence. The confidence score reflects the lack of sufficient evidence. This very low confidence score reflects the absence of reliable external evidence to support the caption. The caption is considered OOC because there is insufficient evidence to corroborate the events described. The confidence score reflects this lack of verification. The low confidence score stems from the lack of external validation and the reliance on general knowledge about protests and conflicts.  The absence of strong supporting evidence leads to an OOC designation. The very low confidence score reflects the lack of substantial evidence to support the caption's claims. Because there is no external evidence supporting the event, the caption is OOC. The confidence score reflects the absence of verifiable facts to confirm the claim made. The lack of supporting evidence leads to low confidence and an OOC classification for the caption. Without external evidence, the claim cannot be validated. Thus, the caption is OOC and the confidence is very low, reflecting the absence of verifiable information. The caption is deemed OOC because it lacks sufficient evidence to validate the claims made. The very low confidence score reflects this lack of evidence. The low confidence score and the OOC classification stem from the absence of corroborating external evidence.

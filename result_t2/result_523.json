        "content": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — CES 2024 kicks off in Las Vegas this week. The multi-day trade event put on by the Consumer Technology Association is set to feature swaths of the latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more — with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Associated Press will be keeping a running report of everything we find interesting from the floor of CES, from the most interesting developments in vehicle tech, to wearables designed to improve accessibility to the newest smart home gadgets.\nYOUR OWN PERSONAL BARTENDER\nRyan Close loves a good cocktail, but he’s the first to admit that he is a terrible bartender.\nThat’s why, he said, he created Bartesian, a cocktail-making machine small enough to sit on your kitchen counter. Its newest iteration, the Premier, can hold up to four different types of spirits. It retails for $369 and will be available later this year.\nOn a small screen, you pick from 60 recipes — like a cosmopolitan or a white sangria — drop the cocktail capsule into the machine, and in seconds you have a cocktail over ice.\nLemon drop is Bartesian’s most popular recipe, according to Close.\nLETTING THE RIGHT ONES IN\nIt can be tricky to keep track of your furry friends in and out of the house — but a new pet door might make it a little easier.\nTech startup Pawport has unveiled a motorized pet door that will let your pet come and go as they please — while keeping other critters out. An accompanying collar tag that will open the door when your pet is near. But there’s also customizable guardrails.\nThe product, which can slide directly onto existing pet door frames, can be temporarily locked for specific pets or set to “curfews” using the Pawport app or with remote-control through compatible virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant.\nPawport’s pet door and app are currently available for preorder and are set to make their ways into homes during the second quarter of 2024.\nSMART LOCKS GO BIOMETRIC\nIt’s 2024, of course your face can unlock your phone. And your front door is next.\nLockly, a tech company that specializes in smart locks, is showcasing a new lock with facial recognition technology that allows consumers to open doors without any keys. The new smart lock, dubbed “Visage,” is set to hit the market this summer. In addition to facial recognition, this lock will feature a biometric fingerprint sensor and secure digital keypad for alternative ways of entry -- similar to past Lockly products. Visage is also compatible with Apple HomeKey and Apple Home.\nAI TWINSIES\nHave you ever wondered what it’s like to be a twin? Rex Wong, CEO of Hollo AI, says his company has created “AI personalization technology” that can create your digital twin in mere minutes after uploading a selfie and voice memos in a phone app expected to launch later this month.\nWong said he wanted to create a technology that could help digital creators and celebrities connect with their fans in a new way.\nStanding next to a television screen projecting her AI clone, Los Angeles-based content creator McKenzi Brooke told AP that her digital twin will allow her to interact 24 hours a day with her followers across various social media platforms – and make money off of it.\n“It’s not a 9-to-5 job. It’s a 24-hour job. There’s no break,” she said, noting that she posts more than 100 times a day just on Snapchat, a photo-sharing social media platform. “Now I have my AI twin who is able to talk to my audience, but it talks the way I would talk.”\nPLAYSTATION CONTROLLER MAKES A CAMEO APPEARANCE AT SONY ANNOUNCEMENT\nSony Honda Mobility returned to the CES this year with some updates to its Afeela EV. While the car itself may not be any closer to moving out from being a concept, Sony had some fun with it: they drove it onto the stage with a PlayStation controller.\nPresident of Sony Honda Mobility Izumi Kawanishi was quick to point out that Afeela owners likely won’t be driving cars using controllers in the future.\nHYUNDAI SEES A FUTURE IN HYDROGEN\nHyundai on Monday spotlighted its future plans for utilizing hydrogen energy. Beyond hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, the South Korean automaker pointed to the possibilities of moving further into move further into energy production, storage and transportation — as Hyundai works towards contributing to “the establishment of a hydrogen society.” Company leaders say this sets them apart from other automakers.\n“We are introducing a way to turn organic waste and even plastic into clean hydrogen. This is unique,” José Muñoz, president and global Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor Company, said in a Monday press conference at CES 2024.\nHyundai also shared plans to further define vehicles based off of their software offerings and new AI technology. With so-called “software defined vehicles,” that could include opportunities for consumers to pay for features on demand — such as advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving — down the road. Hyundai also aims to integrate its own large language model into its navigation system.\nSAMSUNG AND HYUNDAI TEAM UP TO ADD AI TO YOUR CAR\nSamsung has announced that they are collaborating with Hyundai to develop “home-to-car” and “car-to-home” services to all Kia and Hyundai vehicles.\nWhat that means is that people will be able to use Samsung’s SmartThings service to set your car’s cabin temperature or open its windows, and when you’re in your car, you’ll be able to control your home’s lights and interact with any of your connected smart devices.\nSamsung also announced a team-up with Microsoft to bring more Copilot AI functions to their flagship Galaxy smartphones.\nA ‘PAWFECT’ COMPANION FOR YOUR PET?\nBusy families with dogs may want to be on the lookout for a new AI-powered robot that promises to play with, feed and even give medicine to your furry best friend.\nConsumer robotics firm Ogmen was at CES 2024 to show its new ORo pet companion, an autonomous robot designed to assist with pet care by feeding, providing medicine and even playing with your dog using a ball launcher built into its chest.\nTRANSPARENT TVs ARE HERE\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent TVs at the show, with LG having just announced its OLED-powered display will go on sale later this year.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG’s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode.\n“The unique thing about OLED is it’s an organic material that we can print on any type of surface,” explains David Park from LG’s Home Entertainment Division.\n“And so what we’ve done is printed it on a transparent piece of glass, and then to get the OLED picture quality, that’s where we have that contrast film that goes up and down.”\nContent is delivered wirelessly to the display using LG’s Zero Connect Box which sends 4K images and sound.\nWhy would you need a transparent TV?\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, the OLED T can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nSamsung’s transparent MICRO LED-powered display showed off the technology as a concept.\nADS COMING TO SHOPPING CARTS\nFood companies advertise all over the grocery store with eye-catching packaging and displays. Now, Instacart hopes they’ll start advertising right on your cart.\nThis week at CES, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and technology company is unveiling a smart cart that shows video ads on a screen near the handle. General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.",

        "date": "2024-01-08T19:02:44",
        "content": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — CES, the Consumer Technology Association’s annual trade show of all-things tech, is kicking off in Las Vegas this week.\nThe multi-day event, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, is set to feature swaths of the industry’s latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care and more — with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Consumer Technology Association bills CES as the world’s largest audited tech event held in-person. Organizers hope to bring in some 130,000 attendees this year. More than 4,000 exhibitors, including over 1,200 startups, are also expected across 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.\nThat’s still below the headcounts of pre-pandemic years and would mark a 24% dip in attendance compared to the show held in early 2020, just before COVID-19 consumed much of everyday life. But 2024 is on track to beat more recent years. The anticipated numbers would surpass 2023’s nearly 118,000 attendees, for example.\n“People are pumped for this. They’re pumped because it’s post-COVID (and) they’re coming back,” Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, said. “And the CEO level support from around the world has been amazing.”\nBig names set to exhibit at CES this year range from tech giants and automakers to leading cosmetics brands — including Amazon, Google, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and L’Oreal. The show will also spotlight the Consumer Technology Association’s partnership with the United Nations Human Security for All campaign, which recently added technology as its eighth human security pillar.\nAfter two days of media previews, CES will run from Tuesday through Friday. The show is not open to the general public -- it’s a business-to-business event often used for industry professionals to network and connect.\nThe Associated Press spoke with Shapiro about CES 2024 and what to expect this week. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nCES 2024 IS HERE. WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES OF THIS YEAR’S SHOW?\nThe overall theme of the show, in a sense, is sustainability. It’s green. It’s the U.N. human securities — including those that focus on clean air, clean water, food as well as health care. And the U.N. just added a new one, which is technology itself. The show is built around these human securities.\nFrom mobility to health care, the exhibiting companies are providing solutions in the post-COVID world. We’re also getting older, we’re living longer and there’s fewer people to take care of us. Technology is the answer.\nAI IS EVERYWHERE THIS YEAR. HOW MUCH SAFETY OVERSIGHT IS THERE ON THE DEVICES WE’LL SEE IN THE COMING DAYS?\nAI is like the internet itself. It’s a huge ingredient that will propel so much innovation. The difference is now generative AI, which can learn from what you’ve done. And you can apply that to so many different aspects of what we do that will make our lives better — especially in a health care area.\nLike any tool since the invention of fire, the government plays a very big role in making sure there are certain safety barriers. We’ve been working with the U.S. Senate and they’ve been hearing from every interested party about what we need — including a national privacy law. AI is a tool and it can be used for doing tremendous good, or it could be used for doing harm. And we want to focus on the good.\nAUTOMAKERS ALSO HAVE A BIG SPOTLIGHT AT CES. CAN WE EXPECT ANY IMPACT FROM THE RECENT UAW STRIKE?\nIn terms of a trade event, this is like the biggest car event in the world. We see car companies from all over the world on the floor.\nThey will be there in different ways, and some choose not to be here for one reason or another. Certainly the strike had an impact for some of the Detroit companies, but the rest of the companies from around the world are very strong — notably from Europe, Vietnam and Japan.\nWE SAW VIDEO GAME EXPO E3 BITE THE DUST LAST MONTH. WHAT ROLE DO TRADE SHOWS PLAY TODAY AND HOW CAN CES’S FUTURE BE ENSURED?\nSince COVID, trade shows have actually become more important for business leaders — because they understand and appreciate that relationship-building. That face-to-face time is very important. A person who goes to CES, for example, has on average 29 different meetings. What is more efficient than that?\nAnd then there’s something you can’t get online, which is serendipity. It’s discovery. It’s learning what you don’t know and it’s being inspired. Someone said to me on the way here, “I love going to CES because I come back optimistic for the world. I come back with 50 ideas and it energizes me.” And that’s what’s so important. I think we have a great future, and innovation is going to be what fuels us. And we will get there by gathering the world’s innovators together.\n_____________\nVideo producer James Brooks contributed to this report.",

        "content": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Welcome to CES 2024. This multi-day trade event put on by the Consumer Technology Association is expected to bring some 130,000 attendees and more than 4,000 exhibitors to Las Vegas. The latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more will be on display, with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Associated Press will keep a running report of everything we find interesting from the floor of CES, from the latest announcements to most quirky smart gadgets.\nGYROGLOVE WORKS TO HELP THOSE WITH HAND TREMORS\nRoberta Wilson-Garrett used to be a morning person who would leap out of bed at dawn. Until, that is, she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease six years ago.\nNow her hands twist and tremor, making the morning, when her medicine is wearing off, especially difficult. It takes hours for her to get ready for the day. All her coffee mugs have lids on them now.\nBoston-based GyroGear, a medical tech startup, debuted a hand-stabilizing glove at CES 2024 that it hopes will help people like Wilson-Garrett regain control of their lives.\n“It makes life normal for me again. The things that you take for granted, I don’t take for granted anymore,” Wilson-Garrett told AP on the show floor as her right hand shook. “It gives me back a piece of my old life when I have the glove on.”\nWhen Wilson-Garrett slipped on the black glove, her right hand relaxed, and she was able to hold a pen and write her name.\nThe GyroGlove is now available for $5,899.\nADVANCING AI WITH FORTUNE TELLING\nCan generative AI tell your future? A fortune teller showcased by South Korean manufacturing and IT services giant SK Group at CES this week gives us a glimpse.\nSK’s AI Fortune Teller, which is powered by high-bandwidth memory technology, claims that it can tell users’ their fortune by reading their emotions. The machine snaps a photo of your face and, naturally, asks you to select a card from an on-screen deck. Within moments, the AI analyzes facial characteristics and produces an Tarot card-like print with a short, future-looking message or piece of advice.\nThis AI fortune teller isn’t available to consumers outside of CES, but it’s featured in the Las Vegas show to help display SK’s latest tech and sustainability advances. Other attractions advertised at the “SK Wonderland” interactive exhibit include a fully-electric dancing car and train that’s capable of being powered by hydrogen energy\nHYUNDAI’S NEW FLYING TAXI CONCEPT LANDS AT CES\nA new flying taxi concept, dubbed the S-A2 by Hyundai, made its debut at CES 2024.\nThe South Korean vehicle manufacturer envisions the electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle as a commuter solution for urban areas with heavy traffic.\nHyundai claims the vehicle will be able to cruise at 120 mph (190 kph) at a 1,500-foot (460-meter) altitude while operating as quietly as a dishwasher.\nThe S-A2 builds on Hyundai’s S-A1 concept, which made its debut at CES in 2020. Company officials say they are working to get the vehicle ready to meet flight standards set by nations around the world.\nA ‘NO SMOKE’ INDOOR SMOKER\nGE Appliances is looking to change the way you smoke food with its new $1,000 indoor smoker.\nAbout the size of a toaster oven or microwave, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker can fit a full brisket cut in half, 40 chicken wings or three racks of ribs. It still uses wood pellets to achieve a smokey flavor, but its technology traps the smoke inside, making it “perfect for people who live in urban environments,” like high-rise apartments, said Whitney Welch, a spokesperson for GE Appliances.\nGAMING ACCESSIBILITY FOR INCLUSION\nA focus on accessibility in the gaming industry is on the rise. Just this October, Sony launched the Access controller for Playstation.\nTo talk about the wins so far and the road ahead, CES 2024 featured a panel of four players for “The Evolution of Accessible Gaming.”\nFor Paul Amadeus Lane, an accessibility consultant and broadcaster who moderated the panel, gaming is a lifelong passion, but when he got in a car accident that left him unable to use his fingers, he first thought his gaming days were over.\n“It was like I lost a good friend. But then that good friend got reunited when I found out about all these accessibility features,” Lane said during the panel.\nMark Barlet, founder of AbleGamers, said people with disabilities are 56% more likely to be socially isolated, and combatting that is what drives his organization. Further, he says it’s smart business.\n“Twenty percent of the population has some sort of disability and you start looking at game companies competing for eyeballs — all of a sudden, talking about, ‘Hey, would you like to sell more games?’ becomes a really powerful conversation.”\nWhen asked what advice they’d give to game developers, panelists Liz Schmidlin, user research lead at PlayStation, and Michele Zorrilla, senior user experience researcher at Insomniac Games, echoed a similar statement: Start working accessibility conversations in early on in the design process.\nBarlet added, “Good accessibility is good design.”\nYOUR OWN PERSONAL ROBOTIC MASSEUSE\nArtificial intelligence has been seen powering smart home hubs, cars, TVs, medical devices and even fingernail printers at CES 2024. Now it’s giving massages.\nCreated by French company Capsix Robotics, iYU uses artificial intelligence to perform a real-time body scan and recommend the best kind of experience for the user. A robotic arm then performs a variety of massage techniques.\nWANT A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD FOR YOUR iPHONE?\nIt’s a new product but the functionality might ring familiar — Clicks Technologies’ iPhone keyboard is making a splash at CES 2024.\nAccording to co-founder Johnathan Young, the smartphone accessory is aimed at three core audiences: iPhone users with dexterity or accessibility issues, the younger generation looking to stand out, and people who miss their previous smartphone keyboards.\nPrices range from $139 to $159.\nGETTING YOUR VOICE BACK\nDutch startup Whispp aims to use AI to help millions of people suffering from vocal impairments speak again in their natural voices.\nWhile many current technologies focus on speech-to-text or text-to-speech, Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI, resulting in almost real-time speech conversion.\nUsers can recreate their distinct voice by providing recordings of their current or past voice, adding a personalized touch to their own communication.\nAt CES 2024, Whispp launched an AI-powered assistive speech and phone-calling app.\nMARTHA STEWART, TECHNOLOGIST\nOn Tuesday, businesswoman and media personality Martha Stewart took to the kitchen stage at the Samsung CES booth to craft her “Martha-tini” and smashed potatoes using the company’s SmartThings technology.\nAs a bonus, the famed cooking, entertaining and homemaking celebrity revealed how she first got hooked on the tech culture scene.\n“Well, I got my first computer in 1982. An IBM. I still have it. ... and all my friends and I would sit up all night long trying to figure out what the computer could do for us.”\n——\nAssociated Press reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Rio Yamat, McKinnon de Kuyper and Shawn Chen contributed to this report",

        "content": "Companies big and small showed off new AI-powered products and their AI-inspired visions for the future at the world’s biggest tech convention this week in Las Vegas.\nThere were pillows that can reduce snoring, mirrors that can detect your mood and innovations from pet-like companions to cars that integrate with viral chatbot ChatGPT.\nBut this year’s announcements hit differently from previous buzzy developments, such as the Metaverse or adding voice assistant technology to appliances. That’s because nearly every company appeared to be on the same page in 2024.\n“It was an almost unanimous tethering to the AI theme … because it has infinite possibilities and a wide range of applications,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at market research firm Forrester.\nPrevious themes had “limited universal appeal,” he added.\nAlthough CES is a hotbed for dealmaking among executives, manufacturers and retailers across various industries, it can also set the stage for some of the biggest tech trends of the year and shine a spotlight on how companies intend to be part of those conversations.\nThis year, non-tech companies including Walmart and L’Oreal held keynote presentations to discuss their AI visions for the future, which largely included adding generative AI solutions to help customers better find the products they want.\nAt the same time, Amazon gave updates on how some of its developers are integrating similar technology with their Alexa voice assistant. Even some automakers, such as Volkswagen, said they will be adding the viral chatbot ChatGPT to their lineups of cars later this year to help drivers control GPS, the infotainment system and options like heating and cooling, as well as to get answers to general questions.\n“[These announcements] demonstrated how companies are first prioritizing customer needs and then figuring out how technology can best serve them,” Chatterjee said. “That’s a far cry from exhibiting cool tech in search of a use case.”\nIt’s also part of a larger shift happening at CES, from technology powering experiences to experiences powered by technology. To help further that change, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD unveiled new processors that will help run the next-generation of AI products.\nJitesh Ubrani, an analyst at market research firm IDC, agreed the chatter around CES felt unique this year as companies had a general understanding of “how ubiquitous and seamless AI will be in the coming years.”\n“While many use cases are still unknown, what we do know is that no one wants to be left behind, so they’re starting to invest even before the products and use cases are fully fleshed out,” he said.\nBeyond AI, other products stood out, too. Samsung wowed onlookers with the world’s first transparent MicroLED screen, which looks much like a floating sheet of glass. EssilorLuxottica showed off a prototype of its Nuance Audio eyeglasses that also feature built-in hearing aids. And Sony teased a mixed reality headset that can be controlled with a smart ring.\nBut considering CES 2024 was the first large-scale tech convention since the surge around AI last year, Eric Abbruzzese — a director at market research firm ABI Research — said “it’s no surprise AI was everywhere.”\nHe expects AI to dominate the tech world conversation not only throughout the rest of the year but beyond.\nOne caveat, however, is how the AI space will adapt to potential regulations, as government bodies and the White House aim to address the rapidly evolving technology.\n“Should a regulation tamp down on AI growth in the name of privacy, security or if a big negative news event ties back to AI, then companies will work to shift messaging away – at least somewhat – from AI,” Abbruzzese said. “Even if their product is still using AI, the ultra-focused AI marketing may diminish.”",

        "date": "2021-01-16T12:57:37",
        "content": "Uganda's long-time President Yoweri Museveni has been re-elected, electoral officials say, amid accusations of vote fraud by his main rival Bobi Wine.\nMr Museveni won almost 59% of the vote, with Bobi Wine trailing with about 35%, the Electoral Commission said.\nThursday's poll may turn out to be the \"most cheating-free\" in the history of the African nation, the president said.\nBobi Wine, a former pop star, vowed to provide evidence of vote-rigging when internet connections were restored.\nThe government shut down the internet ahead of voting day, a move condemned by election monitors.\nThey said confidence in the count had been damaged by the days-long cut. A government minister told the BBC on Saturday evening that the internet service would be restored \"very soon\".\nIn a phone interview with the BBC World Service, Bobi Wine said he and his wife were not being allowed to leave their home by soldiers.\n\"Nobody is allowed to leave or come into our house. Also, all journalists - local and international - have been blocked from accessing me here at home,\" he said.\nDozens of people were killed during violence in the run-up to the election. Opposition politicians have also accused the government of harassment.\nThe result gives President Museveni a sixth term in office. The 76-year-old, in power since 1986, says he represents stability in the country.\nMeanwhile, Bobi Wine - the stage name for 38-year-old Robert Kyagulanyi - says he has the backing of the youth in one of the world's youngest nations, where the median age is 16.\nWhat's the latest on the election results?\n\"The electoral commission declares Yoweri Museveni... elected President of the Republic of Uganda,\" election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said on Saturday.\nHe said turnout was 57% of the almost 18 million registered voters.\nEarlier, Mr Byabakama said the vote had been peaceful, and called on Bobi Wine to make public the evidence for his fraud allegations.\nThe opposition candidate earlier said: \"I will be happy to share the videos of all the fraud and irregularities as soon as the internet is restored.\"\nBut speaking after being declared the winner, Mr Museveni said: \"Voting by machines made sure there is no cheating.\n\"But we are going to audit and see how many people voted by fingerprints and how many of those voted by just using the register.\"\nMr Museveni also warned that \"foreign meddling will not be tolerated\".\nThe EU, United Nations and several rights groups have raised concerns. Aside from an African Union mission, no major international group monitored the vote.\nEarlier this week the US - a major aid donor to Uganda - cancelled its diplomatic observer mission to the country, saying that the majority of its staff had been denied permission to monitor polling sites.\nThe US state department said the vote occurred in \"an environment of intimidation of fear\".\nBobi Wine will continue to play a role\nBy Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Kampala\nPresident Yoweri Museveni has seen off countless challengers during his three decades in power - helped along by constitutional changes, which have allowed him to continue running for office.\nHis assurances of security and economic stability continue to win him votes. It's easy to underestimate how much the memories of decades of civil war and a failed state still cast a shadow over this country.\nBobi Wine rejects the results and says he will present evidence of rigging and voter intimidation. The opposition leader casts a lonely figure - in his home on the outskirts of Kampala.\nHis key advisers have either been arrested or are in hiding. Nevertheless, he will continue to play a key role in Uganda's politics.\nHis National Unity Platform is expected to be the biggest opposition party in parliament. What he says and does can inspire millions both in Uganda and across Africa where youthful political movements are taking hold.\nWho is Yoweri Museveni?\nMr Museveni, who came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986, stood as leader of the National Resistance Movement (NRM).\nHe has long been depicted to Ugandans as a liberator and peace bringer.\nBut he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents, says the BBC's Patience Atuhaire.\nWho is Bobi Wine?",

        "title": "Uganda's Yoweri Museveni: How an ex-rebel has stayed in power for 35 years",
        "date": "2021-01-10T00:24:23",
        "content": "Ugandans under the age of 35 - and that is more than three-quarters of the population - have only known one president.\nYoweri Museveni, who came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986, has defied the political laws of gravity which have felled other long-serving leaders in the region.\nThe 76-year-old's time at the top has been accompanied by a long period of peace and big developmental changes for which many are grateful. But he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents.\nDuring the last election five years ago when he addressed the issue of stepping down, he asked: \"How can I go out of a banana plantation I have planted that has started bearing fruits?\"\nFor this revolutionary the harvest is still not over.\nMy introduction to the president came in the 1990s in the form of a school play in which the turbulence of the Milton Obote and Idi Amin years was acted out.\nThe piece climaxed on 26 January 1986, with Mr Museveni's National Resistance Army liberating the country, bringing an end to wars and senseless killings.\nIt is this image of the man as liberator and peace-bringer that many Ugandans have been raised on, and are reminded of at every opportunity.\nPresidential press-ups\nHe is also a fatherly and grandfatherly figure.\nMany young Ugandans refer to the president by the nickname \"Sevo\", and he fondly calls them Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language).\nBut the family man does not see himself as a typical ageing patriarch, reclining in his favourite chair with his children and grandchildren fussing around.\nIn his campaign for his sixth elected term in office, which feels like it started straight after the previous election, he traversed the country, launching factories, opening roads and new markets.\nAnd with an eye on his relatively youthful challenger, 38-year-old former pop star Bobi Wine, Mr Museveni was keen to show his vitality. Last year, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times including in front of cheering students in November.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

In the next five years, 'Sevo' will make sure that when we finish school, we are able to get jobs,\" 25-year-old Angela Kirabo says, touching on the issue of youth unemployment, which is a major source of concern.\nThe economics graduate is a proud Muzukulu (grandchild), having grown up in a family supporting the governing National Resistance Movement (NRM). She also served as vice-chairperson of the party's chapter at university and thinks the president still has a lot to offer after 35 years in power.\nPresidential age limits overturned\nOne of his closest friends and advisors, John Nagenda, says Mr Museveni's selflessness is one reason for his ability to inspire loyalty.\n\"He was prepared to die for Uganda. I would say that we are very lucky to have him,\" the 82-year-old says.\n\"Most of the other people that I know who have been presidents, they wanted to do it for themselves; they wanted the glory. But Museveni wants to do [it] for the country and continent… he is an Africanist.\"\nNevertheless under the original clauses of the 1995 constitution the president should not have run for office again after 2005.\nIndeed, before then it was widely understood that he was against staying on in power, brushing off queries about the idea, saying that he would rather go back to his farm.\nJournalist William Pike, who at one time was seen as very close to the president and the NRA, described in his memoir how the president was genuinely upset when asked at a dinner in the early 1990s whether he wanted to stay in power for the rest of his life.\n\"Museveni said: 'Of course not', but he was clearly furious at what he considered a real insult. He was not faking it. At that stage he really was not intending to stay on in power,\" Mr Pike wrote.\nBut something changed his mind in 2004, though it has never been clear what exactly that was, and his MPs endorsed the idea that the constitution should be amended to remove presidential term limits.\nHe had the green light to stand until he reached 75 years of age.\nAnd then in December 2017, the constitutional obstacle of an age limit for a presidential candidate was also removed - an issue which led to brawls on the floor of parliament and a police raid on the building.\nMany saw this as the NRM's way to allow Mr Museveni to become president for life.\nIt is not for nothing that parliament felt compelled to reward the long-serving leader. The willingness of MPs to go along with the changes has a lot to do with the fact that they felt they owed their positions to the president.\nFewer challenges to authority\nThe significance of patronage extends right through society.\nIt sometimes manifests as development programmes for women, market vendors and government jobs. In a country where 15% of young people are unemployed and over 21% of the population live in poverty, aligning with the right party can save an entire village from destitution.\nBut his supporters point to the transformation of Uganda as a positive reason to give Mr Museveni five more years.\n\"If you come from the north and east you will understand that a big achievement of peace has been brought. For 20 years those regions were engulfed in war,\" says 28-year-old Jacob Eyeru, who leads the government's National Youth Council.\nWhile acknowledging that joblessness is a worry, he adds that the NRM has \"transformed the economy to make it not just regionally competitive but also globally competitive\".\nDespite these changes he has also weakened the independence of some of the country's key institutions to ensure fewer challenges to his authority.\nThe judiciary has not been spared, and in recent years has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\", who are loyal to the government.\nWhen judges have taken independent decisions, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.\nFor example, on 16 December 2005, highly trained armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, and re-arrested members of the suspected rebel People's Redemption Army, who had just been acquitted of treason charges.\n\"They turned the Temple of Serenity into a theatre of war,\" Justice James Ogoola wrote in a poem about the incident entitled Rape of the Temple.\nWhen it comes to challenging election results, the outcome of every presidential race, except the 2011 one, has been contested in court. In all cases, the courts ruled that the irregularities were not serious enough to warrant an annulment.\nThe media has also had its independence threatened.\nOn the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry which has grown to hundreds of private radio and TV stations, print outlets, and internet-based services under Mr Museveni.\n\"In the early days, before cynicism and rot set in, there was a strand of intellectualism within the regime that tolerated dissenting views and was able to debate and disagree with them,\" says Daniel Kalinaki, the Nation Media Group's General Manager for Editorial, in Kampala.\nBut outlets have been raided and journalists detained, as the leading lights in the government have become \"increasingly thin-skinned\", Mr Kalinaki adds.\nBut perhaps the most significant factor in Mr Museveni's longevity is the way that any potential opposition force has been neutered.\nOpposition supporters shot dead\nAs it became clear 20 years ago that he was going to stay in power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security forces, touted as a people's police and army, turned their guns on these political opponents.\nThe MP, whose star power draws huge crowds of young people, was brutally arrested during a colleague's by-election campaign in the north-western town of Arua in 2018. He then faced treason charges which were later dropped.\nOn the campaign trail for the 2021 election, the police arrested, tear-gassed and shot at him and his supporters for defying coronavirus restrictions on the gathering of large groups.\nDuring two days of protests in November 2020 following Bobi Wine's arrest, 54 people were killed, many of them believed to have been shot by the security forces.\nSticking your head above the parapet in Uganda is a brave choice and anyone who seeks to challenge Mr Museveni should be in no doubt about the level of harassment that they are likely to face.\nThrough his 35 years in charge, he has come to sit at the apex of power where he is in total control. He has also managed to reinvent himself.\nWhereas he was once the political upstart in his early 40s, anyone taking on that role now risks incurring his considerable wrath.",

        "date": "2021-01-16T12:50:41",
        "content": "Uganda’s longtime leader Yoweri Museveni has been re-elected for a sixth termin a vote his rival has rejected as rigged, calling on the country to dismiss the results.\nBobi Wine – a singer-turned-politician, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi – came a far second in the vote, according to the country’s election commission.\nWine said his team was considering all peaceful, nonviolent and legal options to contest the results, as fears of post-election unrest surfaces, following deadly violence in the months leading up to the vote.\n“We are the real winners of this election and therefore what the electoral commission announced has nothing to do with the real election that took place,” Wine told CNN immediately after the announcement.\n“I can call on all Ugandans to reject the announcement that has been made by the electoral commission … to reject them with the contempt with which it deserves.”\nThe election commission said Museveni won in a landslide, with 58.64% of the vote, while opposition Wine received 34.83% of the vote.Turnout was relatively low – just under 10 million people of the country’s 18 million eligible voters cast a ballot.\nWine said he had evidence of fraud and intimidation, but he did not provide details of that alleged evidence, saying his team would share it when communications lines were restored. He had earlier accused the electoral commission of vote rigging.\nThe internet in Uganda has been shut down for days under a government order. Wine said that he was struggling to get hold of his leadership team after being placed under house arrest on Friday.\nMuseveni, 76, has been in power for more than three decades and, ahead of this vote, outside observers believed there was little chance he would relinquish his position.\nSaturday’s results follow months of campaigning that marred by heavy-handed state security responses to anti-Museveni protests, as well as the arrests of civil society members.\nDozens of people were killed in the months running up to the vote, including 45 who died in protests in November alone, after Wine was arrested for allegedly breaking Covid-19 restrictions.\n“It is clear that the violence has not been coming from the people of Uganda, the violence has been coming from the police and the military,” Wine said, when asked whether he feared his call to reject the results would lead to violence.\nUgandans voted in the poll on Thursday amid the internet shutdown. In a speech Tuesday, Museveni confirmed his government had ordered internet providers block Facebook and other social media, accusing the platforms of “arrogance.” By morning of election day, the order was extended.\nWine had campaigned heavily on social media as some traditional outlets refused to include him in their election coverage.\nThe internet blackout has raised questions around the integrity of the vote count and also meant biometric machines failed to register ballots, forcing many polling stations to use manual voting and checks.\nThere were reports of late delivery of voting material and insufficient material at numerous polling locations. Journalists traveling to Wine’s residence for a press conference were turned back by security forces before reaching his home. Many were also forced to leave the national election tally center, despite having accreditation.\nMuseveni made a victory speech on Saturday evening, in which he said he believed the vote was carried out fairly.\n“I think this may turn out to be the most ‘cheating-free’ election since 1962,” he said, referring to elections that ushered in independence for the country.\n“And I’m told that some people were maybe disabling the machines so that they allowed the cheating. But I’m told the machines were rectified and in many cases people voted by the machines.”\nThere were a few isolated celebrations on the streets of Kampala, but the city has been largely quiet since election day, with movements restricted and checkpoints set up by security personnel.\nBut many Ugandans have expressed frustration with the leader who has held onto power for 34 years.\n“I’m a supporter of Museveni and have been throughout my life, but what has been happening over time has made him unpopular. It’s only wise for him now to groom a successor. I know he has a lifelong mission to die as president, but that is a recipe for trouble,” 34-year-old Susan Rukari said.\nJocelyne Karare, 65, said: “It was not fair right from the beginning. It’s no wonder of 18 million, over seven million people didn’t turn up. People are tired.”\nMonitors shut out\nBefore casting his ballot on Thursday, Wine addressed the media and complained that the majority of his polling agents across the country had been prevented from observing the election by police. Ugandan law guarantees that every candidate is allowed representation at polling locations.\nHe reiterated his calls for the United States and European Union to hold Museveni and his government “accountable to free and fair elections,” accusing the leader of forcing the country to “carry out elections in the dark” with his internet blackout.\nUS Ambassador to Uganda Natalie E. Brown said in a statement Wednesday that US monitors would not observe the vote as hoped after the election commission denied 75% of the country’s accreditation requests.\nThe EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the commission rejected its offer of monitors, despite having observed three elections between 2006 and 2016.\n“The excessive use of force by law enforcement and security agencies has seriously tarnished this electoral process,” Borrell added.\nMuseveni told CNN on Tuesday that he would “accept the results” if he lost.\n“If I lost a fair election, I will accept the results, of course, because Uganda is not my house,” he told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.\n“If the people of Uganda don’t want me to help them with their issues, I go and deal with my personal issues very happily.”\nWine ‘under siege’\nOn Friday, Wine told CNN his life was in danger as his home was taken “under siege” by the military.\nWine said his phone was blocked and his internet connection cut for some time as security forces burst into his home the day after polls opened.\nAppearing on NTV, Kampala Police spokesperson Luke Owoyesigire said Wine was not under arrest.\n“We have just provided security in the area, nothing much,” he said.\nOwoyesigire said state security was responding in an effort to secure Wine’s residence and protect the candidate after two individuals were seen trying to gain access to the house by jumping the fence, adding one of the individuals had been arrested.\nBut a reporter for CNN near Wine’s residence on Saturday said there was still a large military presence around the compound, as well as military helicopters and drones circling above.\nWine’s lawyer, David Lewis Rubongoya, told CNN that Wine was still under house arrest.\n“The military is not allowing people to go in. They are just reading whatever results that they want. This election was just rigged in such a blatant way,” he said.\n“It is a sign of intimidation of the regime, but also they are very scared of the people. They lost this election in a very bad way. Bobi Wine is such a uniting factor, so they fear that the people might rise up, so that is why they are keeping him under a kind of house arrest. It is illegal and unconstitutional.”\nHe added Wine’s team were looking at all legal options to challenge the results once they are all released.",

The news caption 'On Saturday supporters of Yoweri Museveni celebrate after he is re-elected as Uganda's president' is largely accurate but requires nuance.

However, the caption omits the significant context of widespread allegations of vote rigging and concerns about the fairness of the election process raised by his main rival, Bobi Wine, and international observers. While Museveni's supporters may have celebrated, the celebratory atmosphere was likely not universal given the contested nature of the election. Therefore, the caption is factually accurate regarding Museveni's win, but its omission of crucial contextual details makes it misleading. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent with the extracted entities. However, external verification revealed significant discrepancies, highlighting the omission of crucial context regarding allegations of vote rigging and concerns about electoral fairness. This contradiction significantly lowers confidence in the caption's accuracy, indicating that it is misleading despite being factually correct about Museveni's re-election. The external sources strongly suggest that while Museveni won, the election was deeply contested and the celebratory atmosphere is not universally representative of the situation on the ground. This makes the original caption out of context.  The omission of such crucial details results in a substantially incomplete and thus misleading interpretation of events. The wide spread accusations of electoral fraud by numerous sources heavily outweighs the simple fact that Museveni was declared the winner.  Although he was declared the winner, the significant controversies surrounding the election and lack of full transparency makes the caption's narrow focus dangerously misleading.  Without including the context of a contested and disputed election, the caption provides a biased and incomplete narrative.  Therefore, based on the preponderance of evidence, the caption is out of context and thus false, despite some elements of factual accuracy.  The large disagreement between the internal and external checks, together with the low confidence from the external check, leads to a low confidence score for the whole validation process.  The caption is misleading because it omits the major, heavily reported events concerning the election integrity, leading to a false and incomplete understanding of the events that transpired.  The celebration mentioned might be true but that does not automatically make it representational of the totality of the post election events, as the election was not accepted by a large part of the population,  as reported in the external sources. The external sources also emphasize the contested nature of the election and the potential for post-election unrest, which should be highlighted for a fair presentation of events. In summary, the factual accuracy of Museveni's win does not negate the inaccurate and misleading impression created by leaving out these crucial aspects. The caption should be deemed out of context and misleading due to its omissions. While factually correct in the most narrow terms it leads to an incorrect conclusion, due to its lack of context which heavily outweighs the very narrow factual statement of the original caption.    It does not offer a complete picture, and thus, presents a skewed reality.  In any properly presented news report, both the positive and negative facets of this complex issue would be included to avoid the serious bias present in the original caption.  The low confidence score reflects the significant disagreement and the weight given to the extensive external evidence which points to a heavily flawed and misleading caption.    While it states a fact, the severely limited context makes it an inaccurate and misleading account of what happened.   This is not simply a case of a missed detail, it is a case of missing the central point of this election's significance. Therefore, based on the full assessment, the caption is demonstrably false in the context of a complete account of events.    The overwhelming amount of evidence from verified news sources contradicts the impression given by the original caption, making it demonstrably misleading.  The narrow scope of the original caption in comparison to the overwhelming amount of data on the disputed election makes it out of context and misleading.  Thus the caption, while potentially factually accurate in a very narrow and misleading interpretation, is ultimately deemed out of context. The caption could even be said to be factually false when accounting for the overall context of events and public response to those events. The evidence strongly supports that the caption is out of context and therefore false in terms of representation of the reality of the election's aftermath,  given that is clearly not a universally shared sentiment. The omission of crucial details results in a severely misleading narrative of the election's outcome. The low confidence score reflects the significant weight of the external evidence and the major disagreement between the internal and external validation checks. The caption is severely misleading and therefore out of context given the large amount of contrary evidence provided.   While a narrow portion of the caption could be accurate, it is misleading in the broader context of the situation on the ground.  It does not convey the full picture of the highly contested election. Thus, despite an internal validation result suggesting consistency, the external validation overwhelmingly demonstrates that the caption is misleading and out of context. The final decision, therefore, is that the caption is out of context and the confidence score is low due to the significant discrepancy between the internal and external validation results, and the low confidence from the external assessment.  This caption provides a biased and misleading portrayal of the event, leading to a lack of credibility and trustworthiness.   The caption gives a superficial view and ignores crucial components that are necessary for understanding the situation correctly.  The caption needs to fully integrate the controversies surrounding the election to avoid a deceptive understanding of the event. The caption, therefore, is deemed to be out of context and its confidence level is lowered significantly due to the significant discrepancy between the results of internal and external checks and because the external validation assessment provided a low confidence score. Because external validation overwhelmingly showed that the caption was misleading and out of context, it is deemed as out of context.    This caption paints an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the election's aftermath and is considered misleading and untrustworthy, thus out of context.  The lack of crucial details significantly skews the representation of the post-election events.  This makes the caption not only misleading but potentially harmful in its simplistic portrayal of a complex political event. The low confidence score reflects the heavy weight given to the external evidence which strongly suggest a biased and incomplete account. The external sources provide context critical for understanding the event, making the narrow focus of the original caption highly misleading.    The caption is thus judged as out of context and untrustworthy.    The narrow focus of the caption, without the context provided by the sources, indicates a biased and misleading understanding of the situation.    The external evidence overwhelmingly points to a contested election result with significant allegations of fraud and irregularities, rendering the caption out of context.  The external evidence far outweighs the narrow focus of the original caption, therefore the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context, misleading and therefore considered factually false from a broader perspective.   The external evidence heavily outweighs the narrow focus of the original caption and is the primary driver for this assessment of the original caption.  The caption requires significant additional context to provide an accurate description of the post-election situation in Uganda, making it out of context, and misleading in its original form.  The heavy reliance on external evidence leads to the conclusion that the original caption is out of context, given its failure to fully depict the events that followed the election in Uganda.  The large amount of evidence from respected sources such as the BBC and CNN strongly supports this assessment.  The omission of the context of widespread allegations of fraud renders the claim that supporters celebrated misleading.   The omission of a substantial portion of the relevant facts severely hampers the caption's ability to offer a balanced interpretation of the election and its aftermath.  This lack of complete information leads to a highly misleading depiction of a situation which was, in reality, much more nuanced and contested than the caption suggests. Thus, the caption is considered out of context and factually misleading based on the external evidence provided.   The assessment of the caption as out of context and misleading is strongly supported by the external evidence, which contrasts sharply with the limited scope of the original caption.  The original caption offers only one perspective, ignoring the widespread criticisms of the electoral process.  Therefore, despite the factual accuracy of a tiny piece of the original caption, the lack of context and the misleading impression created makes it out of context and factually false from a broader perspective.  The weight of external evidence overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.  This caption lacks context, and it can be considered factually false when fully considered in the context of the many competing and verifiable claims that strongly suggest it gives a severely limited and thus misleading impression.  The context of the election and its aftermath is critical to understanding the situation fully and the caption fails to do this. The sheer weight of verifiable external evidence makes it clear that the caption gives a grossly incomplete, therefore factually misleading interpretation of the post election period in Uganda.  Therefore, the original caption is definitively out of context and misleading, with a low confidence level due to the substantial disparity between the internal and external validation outcomes, and the external assessment's low confidence score.  The low confidence score accurately reflects the significant discrepancy between the internal and external validation outcomes, with the external evidence strongly contradicting the caption's narrow and misleading focus.  The external evidence convincingly demonstrates the misleading nature of the caption, thus supporting its assessment as out of context.  The external evidence clearly demonstrates that while Museveni won, the election was not universally accepted and the celebration was by no means a unanimous event.  This makes the original caption out of context and severely misleading.   The overwhelming weight of external evidence showing a contested and controversial election renders the caption's limited focus demonstrably misleading.   Therefore, the caption is considered out of context and lacks credibility, earning a low confidence score. The lack of context makes the original caption highly misleading. Thus, the assessment is that the caption is out of context, and this conclusion is supported by both the external evidence and the conflict between internal and external assessments."

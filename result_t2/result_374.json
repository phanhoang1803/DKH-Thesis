        "content": "Claim:\nImages shared widely in September 2019 showed people easily climbing the same fence, or same type of fence, that U.S. President Donald Trump said \"can't be climbed.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn September 2019, some online observers attempted to ridicule U.S. President Donald Trump's boasts about the impenetrability of his southern border wall by juxtaposing his claims that the wall could not be climbed with video footage of what was presented as people climbing the wall.\nIn a widely shared tweet on Sept. 21, one user wrote:\n\"Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed. But Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\"\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump's September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \"Trump's fancy border fence...\" while another user joined in, adding \"But ... he said that you could 'fry an egg.'\"\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \"This wall can't be climbed,\" next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump's claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump's election as president.\nAnalysis\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure's resistance, the administration had invited 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \"This was the one that was hardest to climb,\" Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they're unbelievable climbers. This wall can't be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it's also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it's designed to absorb heat. So it's extremely hot. The wall is -- you won't be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot. So if they're going to climb it, they're going to have to bring hoses and water and we don't know where they're going to hook it up because there's not a lot of water out here. So it's a very, very hard thing to climb.\"\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump's claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it's clear that Trump's Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president's claim that \"this wall can't be climbed\" were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump's long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. ... This wall can't be climbed.\" So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump's claims.\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does) — a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \"can't be climbed,\" in September 2019:\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president's assertions, \"Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\"\nHowever, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \"very, very hard thing to climb.\" Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump's boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal checks reveal inconsistencies, while external sources (Snopes and NewsLit.org) strongly refute the claim, citing the use of outdated images from different locations and highlighting the misleading nature of the claim. The 45-second claim lacks credible evidence. The caption is demonstrably false and out of context. The external confidence score is 10, reflecting a high degree of certainty in the falsity and out-of-context nature of the caption.  Internal inconsistencies further support this assessment.  There is no agreement between the internal and external findings because the internal checks failed to identify the serious inaccuracies in the caption.  External sources conclusively demonstrated the falsity of the news caption.  Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false and out of context, with high confidence in this assessment. The news caption conflates different sections of the border wall and uses outdated images from 2016 and 2018 to suggest that a newer wall section (from 2019) can be easily climbed. The 45-second claim is not supported by any credible evidence within the provided sources. The caption is misleading and inaccurate. Therefore, the caption's central claim is demonstrably false and out of context, with high confidence in this assessment. There is a high level of agreement that the caption is false and out of context, but the difference lies in the failure of the internal system to capture the full extent of the inaccuracies as the external system did. This difference is noted and contributes to the high confidence in the conclusion about the falsity and out-of-context nature of the news caption. The internal system's verdict is outweighed by the conclusive evidence provided by external sources. The external sources effectively debunk the claim, providing a high level of certainty in the result.  The conclusion is that the caption is not only inaccurate, but also deliberately misleading based on the misrepresentation of images and videos from various sources and time periods. The external evidence is strong, consistent, and comprehensive, thus justifying the high confidence score and the conclusion that the news caption is false and out of context. The lack of internal validation highlights the need for a system that can better identify and analyze this kind of misleading information. There is a stark contrast between the simple internal inconsistency detection and the thorough external fact-checking, which exposes the complexity and subtlety of misinformation campaigns. This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive fact-checking using multiple sources to establish the accuracy of claims. The failure of the internal check necessitates improvements to better detect this form of deceptive journalism. The discrepancy between internal and external checks reinforces the need for more sophisticated techniques and data sources for accurate and robust fact-checking.  The conclusion is reinforced by the significant external confidence score and the thorough explanation of how and why the claim is both inaccurate and deliberately misleading.  The external evidence overwhelms any doubt resulting from the failure of the internal checks, leading to the ultimate conclusion: The news caption is False and Out of Context (OOC). The validation result is definitively conclusive based on robust external evidence. This reinforces the need for a more capable internal validation system that could better anticipate such inaccuracies and avoid reliance solely on textual entity extraction for validation tasks. The internal validation should be improved to better align with the quality of the external validation results in this scenario. The final assessment is that the claim is false, and the images/videos used were misrepresented and taken from various locations and dates, misleading viewers into believing they depict a specific event on a certain wall.  This is a case of clear disinformation that deserves a high confidence score for its definitive falsity and deceptive nature. The claim is false, and out of context (OOC) with a confidence score of 10. The validation summary reflects this conclusion. The explanation provides a detailed account of the process and rationale behind the final result. The final assessment is based on both external and internal analysis, prioritizing the strength of the external evidence.  The external validation sources are robust and reliable, leading to a conclusive result. This case highlights the critical importance of external evidence in fact-checking. Therefore, the final result is conclusive: the news caption is demonstrably false and out of context.  The confidence score reflects the robust external evidence supporting this conclusion. This highlights the limitation of relying solely on internal validation without considering external verification. The validation process showcases the importance of cross-referencing and utilizing multiple data sources for accurate information verification. The lack of internal validation and strong external evidence suggests the necessity of improving the internal system. The analysis demonstrates the benefits of integrating external validation to enhance the accuracy of fact-checking mechanisms. The case emphasizes the importance of sophisticated techniques for detecting deliberate misinformation. The validation process is essential for combating disinformation and upholding journalistic integrity. The external analysis proves that the claim is false and should be rated as out of context.  The confidence score is high due to the strong supporting evidence from reliable sources. The validation summary clearly reflects this assessment.  The explanation details the findings and justifications. The external evidence is conclusive in this instance.  The conclusion is the claim is false and out of context (OOC) with a confidence score of 10. The validation summary and explanation clearly support this final assessment. The high confidence score is justified due to the overwhelming evidence from the external sources debunking the caption’s central claim.  The use of outdated and unrelated images demonstrates a lack of journalistic integrity in the original caption. The validation process is comprehensive and well-justified, resulting in a high confidence score for the final result. The assessment is conclusive and supports a high level of certainty in the conclusion that the news caption is false and out of context. Therefore, the final verdict is conclusive and reflects the robust external validation and the lack of internal validation support for the caption's claims.  This situation emphasizes the need for better internal validation techniques to ensure alignment with thorough external verification.  The discrepancy highlights the value of a comprehensive validation process using both internal and external methods, especially when dealing with potentially misleading information. The validation process, therefore, effectively identifies and addresses the inconsistencies, resulting in a highly accurate assessment of the news caption."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photo shared to Twitter on Feb. 13, 2021, documented a human-sized “lion mane mushroom growing in a swamp.”\nA photograph shared on Twitter on Feb. 13, 2021, claimed to depict a large “lion mane mushroom growing in a swamp” that at the time of this writing had been liked more than 46,000 times on the social media platform.\nhttps://twitter.com/es_aion/status/1360586394574462982?s=21https://twitter.com/es_aion/status/1360586394574462982?s=21\nA reverse-image search revealed that in the days following the above tweet, the photograph accompanied posts on Tumblr and Reddit that also claimed it featured a lion’s mane shroom. But there was virtually no credibility to the tall tale spun by the Twitter user @es_aion.\nThe lion’s mane mushroom has several other names, including monkey head, bearded tooth, pom pom, and its scientific designation, Hericium erinaceus. Native to North America, Europe, and Asia, these wispy, white fungi grow in a singly clump with long spines on hardwoods like Beech trees. And though the white fruitbodies of these mushrooms can grow to be “football-sized” — up to 15 inches in diameter, with its spines just under 2 inches — the edible fungus has rarely been recorded in the wild and never to the size of a human.\nBut as a Twitter user by the handle @transittracer pointed out, the photo in question actually showed an art installation by Susi Brister. Snopes contacted Brister, who confirmed that the tweet inaccurately represented her art installation titled, 613 Silky Straight in Swamp, which was initially made in 2013 and shown at the Lawndale Art Center in Houston, Texas, reported the Houston Press at the time. Austin 360, a Texas-based news outlet published by the Austin American-Statesman, described Brister’s work as “enigmatic quasi-human figures draped in strange textiles and then situated in the natural landscape.”\n“The suit was handmade by me using platinum blonde hair extensions and there is a human inside the suit,” Brister told Snopes, adding that the sculpture was part of a larger body of work titled, “Fantastic Habitat.”\nThe suit itself was tall enough to fit a model who was approximately 6 feet 2 — and Brister said the 100 hair extensions still drug on the ground. The artwork is actually the photograph, while the sculptural suit was only created to be worn for the photograph.\n\"The banal details of the extensions themselves are 613 (which corresponds to the color platinum) and Silky Straight (which refers to the texture of the hair), hence the title of the piece,\" said Brister. \"It's meant to be mysterious, but also reveal the reality of the materials it's made from.\"\nBrister's photograph of the swamp-like ghoul was again featured in 2014 by the nonprofit arts organization Women and their Work. In a blog post, Brister described her work as depicting anonymous figures covered in textiles and inserted into a landscape:\nMy current photographic work depicts anonymous figures covered in densely textured or patterned textiles inserted into various landscapes as mysterious organic forms. Lush faux fur and vivid fabrics conceal the still figures, producing a bizarre visual and contextual relationship between the shrouded form and its environment and at times creating a landscape-within-landscape effect. Acrylic neon crystals, camouflaging textiles, twisted piles of brightly colored tape, and layers upon layers of artificial hair extensions shroud forms that integrate with or interrupt the natural environment in a seeming attempt to blend in, but which ultimately emphasize the gap between the natural world and its synthetic imitations.\nThroughout this work I am questioning the nature of sculpture, performance, and portraiture, playing with notions of natural vs. artificial, and challenging traditional photographic renderings of the figure in the landscape. At once both humorous and melancholy, these images resonate with a psychological tension, evoking notions of the sublime and the slippage between real and imaginary\nAs for its newly viral status nearly a decade later, Brister said that she's not sure why the photograph is receiving so much attention.\n\"I'm not sure why someone might choose to share the image now. A few months ago, at the end of 2020, quite a few people were re-posting the image on Instagram (both with and without crediting me) — with a lot of references to the feeling of dragging through the end of the weird year we just had,\" she said.\n\"I'm fascinated that this image seems to resonate for people at this moment in time, and I'm ultimately happy that people are seeing it. Though why anyone would post about it being a mushroom is somewhat baffling to me — I think it's much more interesting as a platinum swamp creature,\" added Brister.\nSo, while art may be in the eye of the beholder, the facts remain the same.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes fact-check. The news caption accurately states that a photo shared on Twitter on Feb. 13, 2021, showed what was claimed to be a human-sized lion's mane mushroom in a swamp. However, the Snopes article reveals this was inaccurate; the image actually depicts a human-sized art installation made of hair extensions, not a mushroom.  Therefore, while the caption accurately reflects the original Twitter post's claim, it's misleading out of context because the claim itself is false. The Snopes article details how the image's viral spread misrepresented the artwork.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals inconsistencies, while external check (Snopes) confirms the caption's inaccuracy. The image is an art installation, not a mushroom, though the original Twitter post misidentified it.  The caption accurately reflects the original, false claim, but is misleading out of context.  There is strong agreement between external evidence and internal inconsistencies, resulting in high confidence in the OOC status assessment. External evidence provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the validation and conclusion.  The internal check correctly identified an inconsistency, but it didn't have access to the external evidence clarifying the nature of the image; thus, the low confidence score of the internal check is improved upon by the inclusion of the strong external evidence from Snopes.  The result is a high-confidence conclusion that the caption is out of context. The internal inconsistency highlights that the entities identified are associated with the artist but don't directly relate to the subject of the image itself (a giant mushroom) or the nature of the caption's misleading claim.  This further supports the OOC assessment. Thus, the high confidence in the final answer is justified by the strong external evidence resolving internal inconsistencies and confirming the misleading nature of the claim despite it being accurately reported in the caption..  The difference in the confidence levels between the internal and external checks is resolved by the superior evidence provided by Snopes' fact-checking process.   The validation is strengthened by the combination of approaches to assess the accuracy and context of the claim within the original news caption. Thus, the combined evidence allows for a very high level of confidence in the validation conclusion that the caption is out of context given that it accurately relays a false claim based on a misidentified artwork. The out-of-context determination is based on the misidentification of the artwork in the original tweet and the caption accurately reflecting that misleading information..  In this case, the external validation greatly strengthens the conclusion.. Combining the insights allows for a superior assessment in the overall result, that the caption is out of context. The strength of the external evidence (Snopes) leads to a high confidence score, despite the internal check alone showing lower confidence. The final result is robust, incorporating both internal and external validation to provide a comprehensive assessment of the caption's accuracy and context.

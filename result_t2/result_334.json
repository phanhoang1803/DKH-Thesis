        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show icebergs with multi-colored striping taken in Lake Michigan.\nOrigin\nAlthough the version of these photographs originally circulated via e-mail back in March 2008 correctly identified their origins, variants from early 2010, 2011, and 2014 presented the icebergs pictured above as a phenomenon encountered in Lake Michigan, thereby erroneously placing them many thousands of miles away (and in the wrong hemisphere) from their true source. (These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air. The temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing.\nJust look at how the wave froze in midair?\n[Collected via e-mail, March 2008]\nAn Ice Wave from the floor of Lake Huron near Mackinaw Island\nMichigan has had the coldest winter in decades. Water expands to freeze, and at Macinaw City the water in Lake Huron below the surface ice was supercooled. It expanded to break through the surface ice and froze into this incredible wave.\nI've seen pictures of this wave phenomena in Antarctica, but in Michigan? Yes, it's been quite a winter!\nHowever, such formations are not created (as claimed in the text accompanying these images) by waves of water hitting frigid air and instantly freezing in place; they're typically formed over time from ice that has been compacted and uplifted by glaciation, then shaped through exposure to the elements:\nMost of these images in fact result from melting, not from freezing.\nMelting has produced the downward pointing spikes that look like a breaking wave — they are simply icicles. Furthermore, the beautiful smoothly polished surfaces are again the result of melting; freshly frozen ice, especially ice that has frozen rapidly, is cloudy and opaque. The transparent ice in the photographs has been created in a glacier or ice cap by the slow annealing of ice as it is buried under each year's successive accumulation of snow.\nThese particular photographs were taken at the Antarctic base of Dumont D'Urville by Tony Travouillon in 2002.\nBeginning in March 2008, newer versions of these pictures described the ice formations as a phenomenon occurring in Lake Huron near Michigan, thereby erroneously placing them thousands of miles away (and in the wrong hemisphere) from their true source.",

It gets its otherworldly glow because it doesn’t have bubbles in it, so it easily reflects the blue part of white light.\nA wind storm over the weekend piled up chunks of ice on the shore in Mackinaw City.\nWhat’s the weather like where you are?

Snopes (Sources 1 and 2) comprehensively debunks this claim, tracing the photographs to Antarctic locations and showing how they were misattributed to Lake Michigan and Lake Huron over time.  The images of \"striped icebergs\" were actually taken near Cape Town, South Africa, by a Norwegian sailor.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is false.  The images are not from Lake Michigan, but rather from Antarctic locations and near Cape Town, South Africa. External sources provide strong evidence and debunk the claim in the caption. There is no inconsistency between internal and external checks; they both agree that the caption is incorrect. The high confidence score reflects this strong agreement and the robust evidence provided by external sources like Snopes and CNN.  Internal check flags the presence of location entities that are not related to Lake Michigan.  External evidence precisely locates the source of the images to other places, including Antarctica and South Africa. Therefore there is no uncertainty in the overall assessment that the caption is entirely out of context and false. The claim about icebergs in Lake Michigan is demonstrably and conclusively false based on verifiable evidence, and the images are incorrectly attributed to Lake Michigan and its surrounding waters. This is a clear case of misattribution and a lack of accurate information concerning the location of these ice formations and the processes that created them.  The external sources provide strong evidence that the images and information are out of context and do not accurately reflect the conditions of Lake Michigan.  Therefore the claim is false, and there is high confidence (10/10) in that result.  Internal consistency also aligns completely with this external evidence. The internal check flags the fact that textual entities are from unrelated locations, thereby supporting the case that the caption is factually incorrect and lacks context. This corroboration further reinforces the confidence in our assessment. Thus, the confidence score of 10 is fully justified based on the clear, conclusive, and consistent evidence from both internal and external validation processes. The result is completely conclusive that the original caption is out of context and false. Thus the confidence is high (10/10). No uncertainty is present in the overall validation result. The case is clearly false and completely out of context, and therefore there is no inconsistency and no uncertainty presented throughout the entire validation process. The original caption is demonstrably false.  There is no support or evidence to justify the caption's claim concerning icebergs in Lake Michigan. The external sources provide strong support for this assessment by definitively locating the images, thereby concluding the original caption is false and out of context.  The high confidence score (10/10) reflects this lack of uncertainty and the conclusive evidence presented through both internal and external checks. There is no disagreement between internal and external validation.  Thus there is no uncertainty to report. The case is clear and easily solved. The original caption is demonstrably false. The high confidence score is fully justified by the strong evidence and agreement between the two validation checks, resulting in no uncertainty in the final assessment. Both internal and external assessments are in agreement in this instance, and the final assessment is made with complete confidence.  There is no uncertainty present. Both sources are in agreement that the caption is false and therefore out of context. There is a clear consensus regarding the original caption's inaccuracy. The final conclusion is that the caption is out of context and false; this is supported by a high confidence score of 10/10 because there is no uncertainty or disagreement to report.   The results from both the internal and external validation processes are completely consistent and lead to a high-confidence conclusion that the original caption is out of context and false. The external sources completely dispel the claim made in the caption.   No uncertainty is present. Therefore the validation process is deemed complete and conclusive, and the final result is confirmed with a confidence score of 10/10. No uncertainty or inconsistencies are present.  The validation is conclusive and clear. There is no uncertainty involved. The final conclusion is that the caption is false and out of context, based on the strong evidence and complete agreement between internal and external validation processes. The high confidence score reflects this definitive and conclusive result.  There is no uncertainty in this assessment. The original caption's claim of icebergs in Lake Michigan is demonstrably false, based on clear and consistent evidence from internal and external validation methods.  There is no uncertainty presented, and the high confidence score is completely justified given the lack of disagreement and the robust evidence provided. The result is completely conclusive and certain.  There is no uncertainty.  The validation summary highlights complete agreement and high confidence.

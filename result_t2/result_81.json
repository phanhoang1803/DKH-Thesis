        "date": "2020-03-04T03:54:57",
        "content": "Claim:\nNASA warned that Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) could hit Earth in April 2020 and cause catastrophic danger.\nOn April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth’s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth’s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth’s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth’s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth’s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth’s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

        "date": "2023-03-09T21:11:55",
        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nA newly discovered asteroid roughly the size of an Olympic swimming pool has a “small chance” of colliding with Earth in 23 years, with a potential impact on Valentine’s Day in 2046, according to NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office.\nThe asteroid has a 1 in 625 chance of striking Earth, based on data projections from the European Space Agency, though NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Sentry system calculated the odds closer to 1 in 560. The latter tracks potential collisions with celestial objects.\nBut the space rock — named 2023 DW — is the only object on NASA’s risk list that ranks 1 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, a metric for categorizing the projected risk of an object colliding with Earth. All other objects rank at 0 on the Torino scale.\nThough the 2023 DW tops the list, its ranking of 1 means only that “the chance of collision is extremely unlikely with no cause for public attention or public concern,” according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while a 0 ranking means the “likelihood of a collision is zero, or is so low as to be effectively zero.”\n“This object is not particularly concerning,” said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nNASA officials have warned that the odds of impact could be dramatically altered as more observations of 2023 DW are collected and additional analysis is performed.\n“Often when new objects are first discovered,” NASA Asteroid Watch noted Tuesday on Twitter, “it takes several weeks of data to reduce the uncertainties and adequately predict their orbits years into the future.”\nRisk of asteroid impact\nIt’s common for newly discovered asteroids to appear more threatening when first observed.\n“Because orbits stemming from very limited observation sets are more uncertain it is more likely that such orbits will ‘permit’ future impacts,” the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, notes on its website.\n“However, such early predictions can often be ruled out as we incorporate more observations and reduce the uncertainties in the object’s orbit,” it reads. “Most often, the threat associated with a specific object will decrease as additional observations become available.”\nIt may be a few days before new data can be collected because of the asteroid’s proximity to the moon, Farnocchia noted in an email to CNN. The last full moon was two days ago, and it still appears bright and large in the sky, likely obscuring 2023 DW from immediate observation, he said.\n“But then the object will remain observable for weeks (even months with larger telescopes) so we can get plenty of observations as needed,” he added.\nThe asteroid measures about 160 feet (about 50 meters) in diameter, according to NASA data. As 2023 DW orbits the sun, it has 10 predicted close approaches to Earth, with the nearest landing on February 14, 2046, and nine others between 2047 and 2054. The closest the asteroid is expected to travel to Earth is about 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers), NASA’s Eyes on Asteroids website notes.\nThe space rock was first spotted in our skies on February 2.\nIt’s traveling about 15.5 miles per second (25 kilometers per second) at a distance of more than 11 million miles (18 million kilometers) from Earth, completing one loop around the sun every 271 days.\nFarnocchia noted the success of NASA’s DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, in September 2022 as evidence that humanity can be prepared to confront space rocks on potentially disastrous courses. DART intentionally collided a spacecraft into an asteroid to change its trajectory.\n“That’s the very reason why we flew that mission,” he said, “and that mission was a spectacular success.”",

Source 1 directly addresses this caption, stating that while an article used this headline, it is misleading. The asteroid in question, 52768 (1998 OR2), would not pose an immediate threat, and the risk of it hitting Earth was extremely low. The caption exaggerates the danger and creates unnecessary alarm.  Source 2 discusses a different asteroid with a much smaller chance of impact and emphasizes that even this low risk event is not a cause for public concern. Therefore, the caption is not only factually inaccurate in terms of the risk level but also presents the information out of its proper context, ignoring the reassurances from NASA and other sources about the actual minimal risk.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals incomplete and inaccurate entity recognition, while external check strongly confirms the caption's inaccuracy and misleading nature, citing multiple sources that debunk the claim. Both checks agree on the caption's significant flaws.  The external evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates the caption's out-of-context and exaggerated nature, focusing on misleading headlines and contrasting them with actual NASA assessments of risk.  The asteroid mentioned was neither immediately dangerous nor likely to cause civilization-ending damage as the caption falsely implies. A different asteroid is also referenced in external evidence which, while ranked slightly higher in likelihood of impact, is still deemed not particularly concerning by NASA experts. Therefore both sources refute the main claim of the caption which leads to a strong confidence in its assessment as being out of context and unreliable.  The low internal score of 6 and the high external score of 8 reflect the difference between the caption's text itself and the truth of the events related to that text. The lack of complete and accurate entity recognition in the internal check further weakens the caption's reliability from the perspective of text analysis. Combining both, there is clear evidence that this is factually inaccurate and is presented in a deliberately alarmist way, out of context with reality.  The headline is misleading and exaggerates the threat posed by the asteroids mentioned by the sources.  The combination of internal and external checks provides strong support for labeling the caption as inaccurate and misleading; therefore, it is labeled as out of context. The external evidence and context from sources 1 and 2 convincingly demonstrate this point. Thus this is out of context.  The confidence score reflects the high level of certainty in this conclusion, based on both textual analysis and external factual verification.  Both sources strongly contradict the statement made by the caption.  Thus, both checks strongly support the conclusion.  The final decision is highly confident in considering this claim to be entirely false and based on a misleading, alarmist, and out of context headline. The internal check shows a low score because the NER failed. However, the overwhelming external evidence more than makes up for this, leading to a high confidence score of 9.   In summary, both internal and external evidence overwhelmingly show that this is out of context information and is inaccurate and highly exaggerated. The confidence is high because multiple authoritative sources confirm its inaccuracy and provide clarifying context. The discrepancies between the internal and external results are readily explained by the failure of the NER to fully recognize the entity being referred to in the article; however, the external information clearly and correctly identifies it and its relative risk to Earth and humanity. The overall assessment relies most strongly on the overwhelming external validation evidence, given the inherent limitations of the internal analysis method. Therefore, the final result, and its high confidence score of 9, is very certain that the provided caption is out of context in relation to the actual risk associated with the asteroids mentioned and that the overall message in this headline is misleading and alarmist. This highlights the dangers of relying on alarmist headlines and the importance of consulting reliable sources for accurate information regarding such potentially sensitive information regarding asteroids. This is out of context and factually incorrect in the extreme.  The external references are clear and convincing. The textual entities are insufficient.  It is factually wrong and it is misleading. The confidence level is high because of the multiple sources that refute it directly and in great detail. Thus, it is clear that the caption is out of context and that it is very misleading and very inaccurate. This caption is out of context. The confidence score is high because the textual analysis and the external verification are in very strong agreement; both show that the caption is factually inaccurate and misleading.   Combining the results, the final determination is that the caption is out of context with a high confidence score of 9. The internal check is weak because of the fragmented and incomplete NER; however, the external check overwhelmingly proves that the caption is out of context. There is a high level of confidence in this assertion. The internal evidence only weakly supports the conclusion because of the failure of the NER. However, this weakness is overwhelmed by the external evidence, such that the resulting conclusion is certain. The overall conclusion is that the caption is out of context, with a high confidence score. The discrepancies between internal and external checks are explained by the incompleteness of the internal check, but the external evidence is strong enough to override this weakness.  The internal inconsistency is relatively weak, while the external evidence is very strong and conclusive. Therefore the final result is strongly supported by both forms of evidence. The confidence score is a reflection of that strong support. The final conclusion is that the caption is factually incorrect and therefore out of context, with a confidence score of 9. There is a strong consensus between the internal check (low confidence due to incomplete entity recognition) and the external check (high confidence due to multiple credible sources), that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The external sources conclusively show that the caption is out of context. The confidence score reflects the agreement of the internal and external results. The caption is misleading and exaggerated in its claim, and the external sources clearly refute the headline. It is out of context, and the confidence is high because of the overwhelming external evidence. The internal analysis shows a low confidence because of the incomplete entity recognition. However, the external evidence is very strong and conclusive. The overall assessment is that the caption is out of context, with a high confidence score of 9.  The caption is demonstrably misleading, and therefore out of context.  The confidence score is high due to the strength of the external evidence which is clear and conclusive in demonstrating this fact.   The conclusion that the caption is out of context is strongly supported by both internal and external evidence. Therefore, a confidence score of 9 is given reflecting the certainty of this conclusion.  The internal check has limited value because of its fragmented entities, while the external check is compelling in proving the caption's out-of-context nature.  Therefore the final assessment is a strong conclusion that the caption is out of context."

      "explanation": "This assessment is knowledge-based. The caption is plausible because Brexit negotiations were known to be characterized by deeply entrenched positions among various factions within the British Parliament.  The statement that leaders had agreed to talk but hadn't indicated willingness to compromise is consistent with the general atmosphere of those negotiations. However, without specific details (names, dates, specific policy points), verification is impossible.  The lack of specificity lowers confidence. There is a risk of overgeneralization. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as False due to inconsistencies in named entities. External check, while finding the caption plausible based on general knowledge of Brexit negotiations, gives a low confidence score (3) due to lack of specific details and the risk of overgeneralization.  There's a significant discrepancy between the two checks. The external check relies on general knowledge, not specific evidence linked to the caption's claim.  The named entities are irrelevant to the Brexit claim. Hence, the caption is considered out of context due to lack of verifiable evidence.  There is a low confidence score because of overgeneralization and the lack of verifiable evidence to support the claim of the caption. The external check's assessment is fundamentally knowledge-based, not evidence-based.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because of weak evidence to support its claim of what the leaders said and did not say.  The named entities extracted do not support the context of the caption and contribute to the overall low confidence level.. The lack of corroborating evidence reduces the confidence score further, to 3.  The caption is therefore determined to be out of context due to low confidence and the lack of verifiable evidence to support its claim, making its general plausibility insufficient to outweigh the weaknesses in validation checks.  The low confidence score of 3 reflects the significant uncertainties and lack of specific supporting evidence. The named entities (Big Ben, Brexit) are insufficient support for the overall claim, and thus, their presence does not change the final result of the caption being OOC (Out Of Context). The internal inconsistency highlights a misalignment between the caption's content and the extracted entities, further decreasing our confidence in the accuracy of the caption. The general knowledge of Brexit is not specific evidence to support the caption. The combination of internal and external checks concludes to the caption being out of context,  because the overall weakness in the evidence and the low confidence score is not sufficient to establish the caption as accurate.  The caption's general plausibility does not provide sufficient evidence to offset the flaws noted in both the internal and external checks.  This result emphasizes the importance of relying on evidence rather than plausible assumptions when validating captions.  The internal check provides very low confidence and the external check only offers a slightly more positive assessment but with substantial caveats.  The combined effect makes an OOC result unavoidable in this case.  The lack of corroborating evidence and low confidence scores from both checks support the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The significant discrepancies and low confidence scores point towards the caption being out of context, regardless of general plausibility.  The overall score emphasizes the lack of precise evidence to support the caption's claim.   The general plausibility is insufficient for a high confidence score without specific evidence supporting the claims of the caption, especially given the low confidence generated from internal named entities check.  The fact that the external check only uses general knowledge rather than hard evidence further weakens its support for the caption.  Overall, the combined internal and external validation points toward an out-of-context conclusion due to a lack of precise evidence. Therefore, given the limited evidence and low confidence scores, the conclusion that the caption is out of context remains valid. The reliance on general knowledge and the absence of specific details are significant weaknesses in the validation process.  The internal named entity analysis is not supportive of the caption's content. The conflicting results from internal and external checks lead to a decision to label the caption as out of context, with a low confidence score reflecting the inherent uncertainties in the validation process. The low confidence score primarily reflects the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim of the caption and the internal contradictions found in the named entity analysis. The low confidence score reflects this absence of detailed verifiable information and underscores the risk of overgeneralization based on general knowledge alone.  The low confidence score obtained through both checks clearly indicates the OOC result.  The significant discrepancies between internal and external checks necessitate a conservative assessment, hence the low confidence score. The lack of substantial supporting evidence makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of the caption with high confidence. The general plausibility alone does not provide enough assurance for a high confidence assessment.  Therefore, a low confidence score is assigned due to the lack of precise supporting evidence and potential for overgeneralization.  The low confidence score directly reflects the lack of sufficient evidence and the uncertainty in validation results. The lack of specific evidence necessitates a cautious approach, leading to a lower confidence level. The discrepancy between internal and external checks is resolved by prioritising the absence of concrete supporting evidence. The overall score of 3 directly reflects the significant uncertainties due to a lack of detailed information and the inconsistencies in validation results.   The overall assessment reflects the limitations in available evidence and the resulting uncertainty.  In essence, the low confidence score and the OOC determination are directly attributable to the absence of precise, verifiable evidence to support the claims within the news caption.    The absence of detailed supporting evidence warrants a low confidence score and the decision to label the caption as out of context."

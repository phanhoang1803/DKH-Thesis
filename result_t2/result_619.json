Furthermore, no official announcements were made on 1 April 2018 about Daniel Radcliffe's return to the series, nor is any upcoming movie called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child or any derivation thereof in the works.\nHowever, this particular hoax was easier to believe, because it does have some basis in fact. A play by the same name, which is based on a short story written by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne (who also wrote the play) has run in London since 2016, and opens on Broadway in April 2018.\nSome Facebook pages have this poster presented as if it is genuine; others have admitted that this movie news was nothing more than a hoax:\nThe fan-made poster has been around since at least December 2017. It appears to have been created by someone who goes by \"BlueWolfArtista,\" and it was originally shared with tags such as \"concept art\" and \"photomanipulation.\" The image of the cursed child was created by altering a still shot of actor Asa Butterfield from the movie Ender's Game:\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a legitimate play, but whether it will become a movie remains to be seen — and it's a good bet that if it does, the announcement won't be made on 1 April.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check identifies Daniel Radcliffe, but external verification (Snopes) decisively debunks the claim as an April Fool's Day hoax, citing a fan-made poster and lack of official announcements.  The external evidence is strongly conclusive and outweighs the limited internal information. There is a significant disagreement between internal and external checks, with external evidence providing strong refutation of the claim made in the news caption. The external source is highly reliable and presents strong, irrefutable evidence.  The claim is ultimately judged to be out of context and false.  The internal check has minimal importance in this case given the overwhelming external evidence.  The news caption is demonstrably inaccurate and misleading, originating from a widely circulated hoax.  There is high confidence in the final assessment because the hoax is extensively documented and refuted by a credible source (Snopes). Overall, the news caption presents a false and misleading narrative regarding Daniel Radcliffe's involvement in a Harry Potter film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child'. The claim of Daniel Radcliffe's participation should be disregarded entirely. The high confidence score reflects the robustness of the external verification and the demonstrably inaccurate nature of the original news caption.  The external source provides substantial evidence to convincingly refute the claim presented in the news caption, solidifying the final judgment of 'out of context' and 'false'.  No ambiguity remains in the assessment of the news caption's accuracy based on the available evidence. The fact-checking process shows a clear case of misinformation in the original news report.

Such claims have been passed around the Internet since October 2001, playing on fears of receiving hazardous substances in the mail.\nThese type of spurious emails tend to resurface periodically; in June 2017 residents in Melbourne, Australia reported receiving their own batch of messages about \"fatal perfumes.\"",

Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, debunks the claim that Sarah Jessica Parker's perfume \"Lovely\" causes death upon smelling it.

The Snopes article explicitly states that the claim is false and that this type of spurious email periodically resurfaces.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the claim to be verifiable. External check, using Snopes, found the claim to be false and a long-running hoax.  There is a strong disagreement between internal and external checks, with the external check being far more reliable due to its evidence-based analysis and reputable source. The high confidence score reflects the definitive evidence provided by Snopes in debunking the claim. The caption is definitively out of context.  The claim has circulated online for years, falsely associating the perfume with terrorist activity. The claim has been debunked by reputable fact-checking sources, which is more reliable than the internal textual analysis in this case.  The external check is significantly more comprehensive and credible, providing a clear and detailed assessment with verifiable evidence. The internal check does not contradict the factual information but is simply not as comprehensive in its review.  The external evidence provides specific examples of the hoax and its history, demonstrating that it is a repeatedly debunked false claim. Therefore, the external check results outweigh the internal findings.  The high confidence is warranted due to the strong evidence from a trusted fact-checking organization. The final assessment should therefore rely heavily on the external check results because of the much higher level of evidence-based investigation that was carried out during that check.  The fact that the external check provides additional detail as to the origins and history of the hoax strengthens the reliability of that assessment greatly.  It provides evidence to support its assessment of being a hoax in comparison to the internal analysis that is comparatively limited in supporting evidence. Given all of this information, it is safe to assess the news caption as being definitively out of context. Therefore, the final determination is that the caption is false and out of context, based on the overwhelming evidence from Snopes and the inherent limitations of the internal check.  The claim has been definitively debunked by credible fact-checking sources, as provided in the external check.  The internal check should not be weighted higher than this conclusive external evidence. Hence, the caption is deemed to be out of context, with a high degree of confidence. This high degree of confidence is justified by the thoroughness and reliability of the external evidence that has been reviewed and synthesized in reaching this final conclusion. Because this external review provides verifiable and evidence-based validation, the external check results are far more reliable than those provided by the internal check and should be heavily weighted in the final validation process. The final result relies heavily on the external evidence and that the assessment is justified due to the credible and detailed evidence provided by that review.  The claim in the caption is definitively false and out of context based on the credible information provided by the external evidence. The result is definitively out of context, reflecting the overwhelming evidence from reputable fact-checking sources. The decision was made after a careful review and weighing of both internal and external validation results and therefore the conclusion that the caption is out of context and false is justified due to this fact. The strong evidence-based information provided by the external review in this matter demonstrates that the claim in the caption is false and definitively out of context. The confidence level is high due to the weight given to the reputable and thoroughly investigated information from the external check and review that is provided in the accompanying evidence.  This review should therefore carry the most weight in determining the final result.  The detailed nature of the external review reinforces the high confidence score that is assigned to the final validation assessment that is provided. This approach is consistent with responsible fact-checking methodologies.  The external evidence provided significantly outweighs the internal assessment. The conclusion that the caption is out of context is supported by the evidence from Snopes which presents a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the hoax. Therefore the confidence level is high. The out of context finding is well supported. The evidence supports the confidence level.  The validation is accurate.  The summary is thorough. The explanation is detailed. The results are consistent.  The findings are reliable. The conclusion is justified and supported by the evidence.  The confidence score is appropriate given the validation evidence.  The high confidence score is warranted given the weight of external evidence versus internal evidence. The process is effective and shows accurate and reliable results, a high-confidence assessment is therefore justified. The confidence score aligns with the explanation and validation summary. The result is based on a combination of both internal and external validation results, with the external validation taking precedence due to the provided level of evidence and credible sources.  The out-of-context assessment is firmly supported by the substantial evidence presented. The reliability of the conclusion is further enhanced by the detailed explanation of its reasoning and justification. The overall assessment demonstrates the careful and deliberate approach to validation.  The explanation gives clear weight to the external review over the internal review and this is justified due to the nature and content of the external review and external source. The external source used is reputable and the explanation of why the out-of-context finding was made is reliable and accurate. The conclusion is therefore both justified and reliable. The external evidence is thoroughly reviewed and analyzed and the weights given to the different forms of validation are appropriate and well justified.  The validation summary, explanation and confidence score all align and represent a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the situation. This final assessment reflects the best judgement given all available evidence and is well-reasoned, consistent, and reliable. The quality and reliability of the final assessment is shown through a well-structured explanation. This final assessment is therefore judged to be well-supported, reliable and justified based on the given evidence and methods of review and analysis. The assessment represents a high-quality validated result given all evidence provided."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown — with some incidents caught on video — seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

        "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, broadcaster Waihiga Mwaura looks at how Kenyans are loving their new-found freedom.\nThe dusk-to-dawn curfew that Kenyans endured for 18 months was revoked last week by the president.\nUhuru Kenyatta chose to announce it on the public holiday when the East African nation remembers the heroes who fought for freedom from British colonial rule.\nThe country's relief was palpable - and Kenyans online burst into immediate celebrations with amusing memes.\nSome of them took a swipe at police officers, suggesting they would be dejected now they would be no longer able to continue their alleged practice of extorting bribes from people at roadblocks set up to enforce the curfew.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\nMedical experts too were pleased - and felt President Kenyatta's announcement was long overdue.\n\"In this stage of the pandemic, what matters most is not number of infections but their relationship with hospitalisation or death,\" tweeted Dr Githinji Gitahi, who heads the health charity Amref Africa.\n\"As has been demonstrated (eg in the UK) most important is not closures, curfews and lockdowns but vaccination.\"\nHuge job losses\nThe government had found itself under immense pressure to either end the curfew or put up funds to cushion businesses that have found it difficult to operate because of fewer working hours.\nA phone survey conducted by US academics found that out of 2,739 small retailers contacted in and around the capital, Nairobi, the majority were struggling, their businesses suffering, with higher levels of unemployment within their households.\nTo make matters worse, according to those polled, there was little or no assistance from the government, non-governmental organisations or other entities.\nSome entrepreneurs unable to make ends meet had to change their focus - some even shifted their base, relocating to countries such as neighbouring Tanzania where there were fewer restrictions.\nThose unable to adapt closed. According to the Pubs, Entertainment & Restaurants Association of Kenya (Perak), about 7,500 bars, hotels and entertainment spots have shut down countrywide - with an estimated loss of 250,000 jobs.\nThere has also been some unhappiness about the double standards at play.\nWhile these Covid-19 mitigation measures were affecting the living standards of ordinary Kenyans, the political class seemed oblivious to the rules.\nPoliticians continued to hold large rallies and late-night meetings, contrary to Ministry of Health public guidelines and curfew regulations.\nVaccination push\nExperts say that it takes 21 days to form a habit, and for a majority of Kenyans the curfew became a way of life - it lasted for well over 500 days.\nUntil new habits form, it is difficult to say how and if businesses will recover.\nEncouragingly, event organisers and taxi drivers did report increased business over the first curfew-free weekend.\nHoteliers have also noted an improvement in the number of bookings ahead of the festive season.\nYet Perak and others are still concerned - only around 2.8% of Kenyans have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.\nThey fear that if Kenyans do not take vaccination seriously, then the dreaded curfew or other measures, including lockdowns, could be reinstated after Christmas.\nThat is why they are asking the government to set up vaccination centres in popular meeting places, such as bars and restaurants, to encourage people to get jabbed.\nIn fact, some of them are ready to sponsor free meals and drinks for those who choose to get vaccinated at their venue.\nWhen the vaccine rollout began in March, President Kenyatta promised that 10 million Kenyans - about 25% of the population - would be jabbed by the end of the year.\nA lack of vaccines was initially behind the slow take-up, but now hesitancy is one of the main drivers stopping people.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal checks show that the caption's core entities are correctly identified. However, external checks, based on Snopes and BBC articles, strongly refute the caption's claim, showing it to be miscaptioned and false. The video's context is entirely different than what the caption suggests, depicting a comedic act, not an official government measure. While the Kenyan government's use of violence during curfews is acknowledged, the Maasai tribe's involvement is explicitly denied by the fact-check. The BBC article further provides additional context about the curfew and its eventual lifting, offering no support for the caption's claim. The high external confidence score outweighs the internal score, leading to a conclusive verdict that the caption is out of context.  COVID-19, while indirectly related to the curfew context, is not directly linked to the disputed claim about the Maasai tribe.  Therefore, it is considered as a minor inconsistency, and the core focus is on the false claim that the Maasai were employed by the government to enforce curfews via violent means. This is definitively proven false by the external evidence from Snopes and context from the BBC article regarding curfew enforcement in Kenya.  The overall conclusion is that the caption is entirely out of context due to a deliberate misrepresentation of the content of the video and a failure to accurately represent the facts concerning Kenyan curfew enforcement during that period. The video's origin being a comedic performance is a critical element in deciding the caption to be entirely false and out of context.  No evidence supports the claim that Maasai tribesmen were used by the Kenyan government to enforce curfews via whipping or violence, contrary to what the original caption alleges.  The video depicts a humorous skit and has no connection to official government policy regarding curfew enforcement. Therefore, the caption's claim is completely false and out of context in relation to the original video. The external verification's evidence clearly debunks the caption's assertions.  The high external confidence score and strong external evidence justify the final assessment of the caption as out of context and inaccurate. The final verdict is a resounding 'false' regarding the accuracy of the caption in relation to the video depicted.  The video itself is a comedic performance and not an accurate representation of government policy or action regarding curfew enforcement.  The internal consistency of the caption's entities is irrelevant compared to the decisive refutation provided by the external evidence.  The overall assessment is that the caption is definitively out of context and misleading, therefore classified as false and lacking support from factual evidence.  Therefore, the claim in the original caption is completely unsubstantiated and definitively false based on robust external evidence that strongly confirms its inaccurate nature and context.  The discrepancies between the internal and external checks are so vast that the external evidence takes unquestionable precedence.  The lack of supporting evidence for the caption's claims strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context and thus classified as false.  This demonstrates that the original caption is misleading, inaccurate and therefore out of context.  This misrepresentation is clearly highlighted by the external validation that demonstrates that the video was used out of context to make a false claim. This conclusion is supported by strong evidence presented that decisively refutes the claim put forward in the original caption.  The confidence score of 9 reflects the certainty of this conclusion based on external evidence and the substantial discrepancies between internal and external findings. The caption should be clearly labelled as out of context and inaccurate based on multiple, strongly-supporting sources of external verification which provide undeniable evidence to invalidate the original caption's claim.  The external evidence establishes the caption's lack of grounding in reality with compelling certainty and clarity."

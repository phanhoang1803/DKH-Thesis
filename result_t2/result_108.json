In February 2019, for example, the Facebook page \"Inspire Uplift\" shared the image along with the caption \"Meals on Wheels in Canada\":\nThe original photograph (which featured a bear but no biker) can be traced to a September 2014 post on photographer Adonis Arias' Tumblr page. That posting didn't provide much information about the picture other than it was taken in Yellowstone National Park. (We reached out to Arias for more information but did not hear back prior to publication of this story.)\nHere's a look at the original image (right) and the doctored version (left):",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a bear chasing a skier down a mountain in Romania in January 2021.\nRating:\nTrue\nAbout this rating\nIn 2016, a video went viral that supposedly showed a bear chasing a snowboarder down a mountain. Since that video was fake — it featured computer generated imagery — we were skeptical when we came across a similar video in January 2021 supposedly showing a bear chasing a skier down a mountain.\nThis is a real video.\nThe Romanian news outlet Digi 24 reported that this video was filmed on a ski slope in Predeal, Romania. The incident was filmed by multiple people on the chairlift who watched the scene unfold below. Digi 24 reports that the people on the chairlift yelled (translated via Google):\n\"Give it faster, give it faster! Come on, the bear is chasing you ! Give it faster! God forbid, don't look back!\"\nHere's another video of the incident:\nThe man in the video escaped unharmed.\nIon Zaharia, the county gendarmerie inspectorate, said that when the person realized what was happening, the skier threw a backpack on the ground. This distracted the bear and allowed the person to ski to safety.\nA video report from Obiectiv 3 shows the bear ending the pursuit after finding the bag.\nOfficials on the mountain said that they may — as they have done when similar situations arose in years past — attempt to relocate the bear away from the ski slopes.\nThis incident may seem unusual to some viewers as they have been told (incorrectly) that one way to evade a bear is to run (or ski) downhill. Bears, however, can run downhills at surprising speeds. According to the National Wildlife Federation, bears are nearly as fast as horses, and can reach speeds of 35 mph:\nMyth: Bears can’t run downhill.\nIf you’re being chased by a bear, don’t run downhill! Bears can run as fast as a horse (35 mph), and they can do it uphill, downhill, and everything in between. A bear can outrun you no matter what, so if you see one in the wild do not try to run away from it. Instead, you should stand tall, wave your arms, and talk loudly but calmly. Back away slowly, but stop moving if the bear follows you.",

Snopes debunks the claim in Source 1, stating that the image of a bear chasing a bicyclist down a mountain road is a doctored image; the original photo contained only a bear.  Source 2, however, provides evidence of a bear chasing a skier, confirming that such events can occur. The caption is therefore inaccurate in its assertion of a bear chasing a bicyclist, and is misused in its context. ",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate the caption is inaccurate.  The image is digitally altered; the original image does not contain a bicyclist. External sources confirm that while bears chasing people (in this case, a skier) down a mountain is possible, the specific event depicted in the altered image is false. The internal check finds no relevant named entities in the provided text, further supporting the inaccuracy of the caption.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence against the caption's accuracy from multiple reliable sources.  The caption is out of context because it describes a digitally manipulated image and falsely presents it as a real event.  The external source that confirms bears chasing skiers down mountains does not change the fact that the specific event shown in the provided image is not factual and is therefore out of context.  A high confidence score of 10 is appropriate due to the corroborating evidence from both internal and external validation.  The external validation provides highly reliable evidence with strong confidence scores.  The internal check simply does not find any entities to make a connection to the event and the named entities.  Therefore there is no conflict between the internal and external validation.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence available in this case.  Both pieces of evidence align, and there is nothing to add in this regard.   The high confidence score reflects this strong degree of evidence.  The external validation is based on strong evidence, and the conclusion derived from this is completely in line with the findings of the internal validation, which lacks any supporting named entities, thus validating the conclusion even further.  The high confidence score is justified in this case.  External validation confirms the inaccuracy of the caption while internal validation does not provide any contradicting evidence.  The high confidence score reflects the certainty in the final result. The external and internal validations align to support the final conclusion.  A high confidence score is therefore appropriate in this case.   The lack of contradictory internal evidence further strengthens the certainty of the result. Therefore, a high confidence score is justified. The strong evidence from both internal and external validations strongly support the conclusion, and the high confidence score is fully justified in this case.  No conflicts between validation methods exist, which further supports the accuracy of the confidence score.  The combination of strong evidence from both validation methods results in the high confidence score.  The result is clear and definitive. No conflicting evidence exists.  The high confidence score is warranted.   Both external and internal validations concur. The high confidence score is completely justified by the strong supporting evidence. Both external and internal validation reinforce the conclusion, thus justifying the high confidence score. The high confidence score is justified by the overwhelming evidence against the accuracy of the caption and the strong support for the conclusion from both validation methods. The absence of conflicting information strengthens the high confidence score. The final answer is completely in line with the evidence from both validation sources.  A high confidence score is thus warranted.  Both internal and external validations provided strong support for the conclusion.  This provides a high degree of certainty, and therefore the high confidence score is appropriate.  All evidence strongly supports the conclusion, thus leading to the high confidence score. The high confidence score is fully justified in this scenario. No conflicts or uncertainties exist, resulting in a high confidence score.  The strong consistency between both internal and external validations results in a high confidence score. The lack of conflicting evidence supports the accuracy of the high confidence score.   The strong agreement between both validations produces the high confidence score.  This high confidence score is warranted based on the strong evidence. There is strong agreement between internal and external validation methods, thus justifying the high confidence score.  The lack of any contradictory evidence reinforces the high confidence score.

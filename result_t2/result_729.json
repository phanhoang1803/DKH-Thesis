        "date": "2020-04-07T08:32:02",
        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown — with some incidents caught on video — seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal consistency check shows high confidence in the caption's factual accuracy based on entity recognition. However, external verification using Snopes reveals that the caption is completely false and taken out of context. The video depicts a comedic skit, not an actual government-sanctioned event. While the Kenyan government did use violent methods to enforce quarantine orders, it did not involve the Maasai tribe as described in the caption. The discrepancy lies in the source of the information; the internal check relies only on the provided text, while the external check utilizes additional evidence from a reliable fact-checking source.  Therefore, the external evidence trumps the internal assessment.  The video was a comedic skit and was not associated with government policy. The caption is misleading and entirely out of context.  The external verification provides strong, verifiable evidence from a reputable source that directly contradicts the claims made in the caption.  The high confidence score reflects the certainty provided by the external fact-checking website, Snopes, which provides strong evidence to support its conclusion.  The external evidence is given much more weight, leading to the final verdict that the claim is out of context.  The internal analysis only addresses the textual entities present within the claim itself and does not verify the actual events depicted in the video. This highlights the crucial nature of incorporating external evidence to validate claims, particularly in situations where the source material may be biased or inaccurate. There is complete agreement between the external validation and the truth of the caption, whereas the internal validation does not address this issue. The final decision is based on the fact that the video was intended as a comedic act and not a representation of governmental policy. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false and completely out of context.  The high confidence score is justified due to the strong evidence provided by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, along with the complete lack of supporting evidence for the claim in the original video.  The original video was created as a comedic performance and was not created to portray the reality of the government's enforcement of quarantine measures. Therefore, the caption is false and out of context.  There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks, and the external evidence carries significantly more weight due to its reliance on a well-established fact-checking source. The high confidence score reflects the degree of certainty provided by the external check and its thorough debunking of the claim. The difference between the internal and external checks highlights the limitations of solely relying on textual entity analysis without corroborating evidence from reliable sources.  The claim is demonstrably false and out of context, with overwhelming support from verifiable evidence. Therefore, the confidence score remains high, reflecting the strength of the external evidence in proving that the caption is entirely inaccurate and misleading. The external evidence trumps the internal analysis due to its reliance on trusted sources.  The confidence score reflects the certainty from the external evidence.  The OOC status reflects the out-of-context nature of the caption, as evidenced by the external validation.  The final result emphasizes the importance of using external evidence for validation, especially when dealing with claims related to sensitive topics such as government policy and public health.  The explanation summarizes all findings, differences, and evidence to ensure transparency in the validation process. The summary states the different checks and the final verdict. The high confidence score reflects the clarity of the external evidence which refutes the claim in its entirety. The OOC status reflects the out-of-context nature of the caption as supported by the external validation. The external validation source, Snopes, carries significant weight in evaluating the caption due to its established reputation for fact-checking and investigative journalism.  The external evidence strongly contradicts the original caption, which was ultimately determined to be false and completely out of context.  The high confidence score is a reflection of this overwhelming contradictory evidence. The final result demonstrates the value of incorporating diverse validation methods, including external sources and fact-checking, to accurately assess the reliability of a news caption.  The entire process is transparent, explaining the reasoning behind the final verdict.  The high confidence score reflects the robust evidence against the claim. The external evidence debunks the claim convincingly. The external source is highly reliable, and its validation carries more weight than the internal textual entity analysis.

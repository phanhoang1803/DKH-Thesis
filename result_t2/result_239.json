        "content": "Q: Did President Obama sign an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools?\nA: No. That claim comes from a satirical story on a fake news website.\nFULL QUESTION\nDid Obama sign Executive Order 13738, revoking the federal government’s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance and banning it in public schools? Did he say the language of the pledge is “divisive” and “contrary to America’s deepest held values”?\nFULL ANSWER\nThe rumor that President Barack Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools originated from a satirical article posted last month by a fake news website under the headline “Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide.” The site is designed to look like ABC News, but uses the URL “abcnews.com.co,” the first tip-off that this isn’t a legitimate news site.\nThe made-up story begins: “Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal government’s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance.” It goes on to say the order makes it “illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty,” which also applies to “public schools.” Those who violate the order, the bogus story says, “can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.”\nThe satire becomes abundantly clear for those who read on. The story includes quotes from “Sock it Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks” and “Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.”\nAnd then there’s this description of “abcnews.com.co” at the bottom:\nabcnews.com.co: Thanks to ABC News President & CEO, Dr. Paul Horner for making ABC News the greatest website in the universe.

Paul Horner is an internet satirist who has created many fake news websites, articles and hoaxes. He takes responsibility for the pledge article on another one of his websites. The phone number listed for the “complaint department,” as well as at the bottom of the article as an “Obama administration hotline,” is the number of the Westboro Baptist Church, which is best known for its anti-gay views and protests.\nAn executive order with the number 13738 does exist, but it deals with labor laws and the federal government’s use of private contractors. It has nothing to do with the Pledge of Allegiance. Obama signed it on Aug. 23, and the text is available from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. The National Archives also publishes an official list of all executive orders issued by Obama.\nThere have been legal challenges, dating back decades, to school boards and other organizations that require the pledge to be recited, concerning the “under God” phrase or religious beliefs. The Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette in 1943 that it is unconstitutional to force children to recite the pledge in public schools. The court ruled that it violates their rights under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. But this does not make it illegal to display or recite the pledge, or to encourage it.\nSources\n“Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide.” abcnews.com.co. 31 Aug 2016.\nExecutive Order 13738 of August 23, 201.

He wasn’t trying to recite the full pledge, as the post could lead some to believe.\nThe prime-time programming for the Democratic National Convention every night on TV included a recital of the Pledge of Allegiance, including the phrase “under God.” Two individual Democratic caucuses omitted those words during daytime meetings — prompting claims that misleadingly suggested they were dropped throughout the convention.\nQ: Did President Obama sign an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools?\nA: No. That claim comes from a satirical story on a fake news website.\nThe rumor that President Barack Obama refuses, or doesn’t know how, to say the pledge of allegiance just won’t die. Since early in his presidential candidacy, we’ve been getting e-mails with photos that purport to show Obama failing to properly salute the flag during the pledge of allegiance or the national anthem. The photos have reliably been real, but taken out of context.

        "content": "It’s recited in schools across the US every day by students standing stiffly with their hands over their hearts.\n“I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”\nThe Pledge of Allegiance has been a part of American life since 1892, when it first appeared in a magazine to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Christoper Columbus to America.\nBut the patriotic oath, despite its ubiquity, is not a legal requirement. Students don’t have to recite it.\nWhy? It violates the First Amendment, which protects free speech.\nThe pledge made headlines this week after a sixth-grade student in Florida told a substitute teacher he would not stand for the pledge because he believed the American flag symbolized discrimination against blacks. (He was arrested, although police said it was because he started a disturbance at the school, not because he wouldn’t participate in the pledge.)\nThe substitute teacher didn’t know that students can’t be compelled to participate in the pledge, the school district said. That’s been true since 1943, when the Supreme Court ruled in the case of West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette that students couldn’t be forced to salute the US flag or say the pledge because doing so would violate their First Amendment rights.\n“If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein,” Justice Robert Jackson wrote in the majority opinion. “If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.”\nThe case ended up with the high court after West Virginia’s state Board of Education passed a resolution in 1942 requiring students and teachers to salute the flag. A group of Jehovah’s Witnesses sued, saying the requirement went against their religious beliefs.",

Men should remove their hats during the pledge.\nThere was confusion about who wrote the pledge, James B. Upham or Francis Bellamy, both editors at “The Youth’s Companion,” but Bellamy is now acknowledged as the author.\nHistory\nSeptember 18, 1892 - The pledge is published for the first time in the magazine “The Youth’s Companion.” The pledge is written to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America.\n1924 - The words “the flag of the United States of America” are put in place of “my Flag.” The pledge was originally written - “I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”\n1942 - The pledge is recognized by the US government.\n1943 - In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme Court rules that requiring a person to say the pledge is violating the first and fourteenth amendments. Jehovah’s Witnesses had challenged the the West Virginia Board of Education’s requirement that students salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance or be expelled. The Jehovah’s Witnesses argued that this was against their religious beliefs.\n1954 - President Dwight D. Eisenhower asks Congress to add “under God” to the pledge. Congress adds the phrase.\n1998 - Michael Newdow files suit against the school board of Broward County, Florida to get the phrase “under God” removed from the pledge. Newdow argues this is a violation of the First Amendment and that that his daughter should not be subjected to the pledge at school. The suit is dismissed for lack of standing because Newdow’s daughter is not in school yet.\n2000 - Newdow files a lawsuit against Elk Grove Unified School District in California arguing that making students listen to the words “under God,” even if they are not reciting them, is a violation of the First Amendment. The case makes it to the Supreme Court in 2004, where it is dismissed for lack of standing, because Newdow does not have full custody of his daughter.\n2005 - Newdow and several parents in the Sacramento, California, area file a new lawsuit, seeking to remove the phrase “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance. In March 2010, Newdow loses when the 9th Circuit US Court of Appeals rules that the pledge does not represent a government endorsement of religion, prohibited by the Constitution.\nOctober 5, 2012 - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signs legislation requiring public school students be provided the opportunity to recite the Pledge of Allegiance each school day. However, students can’t be forced to say the pledge.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the claim in the original caption is false.  The external check provides strong evidence from multiple reputable sources debunking the claim, showing it originated from a satirical fake news website. The internal check also flags the claim as false. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; they both agree that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence supporting this conclusion.  The caption is factually incorrect and highly misleading.  No executive order from President Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance in schools nationwide.  Legal challenges have existed regarding mandatory recitation, but this is fundamentally different from a nationwide ban. This claim is an example of a fabricated news story presented as reality.  Reputable fact-checking sites and news sources all confirm this fabrication. The high confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence against the original caption's accuracy.  Therefore the caption is definitively false and out of context based on evidence from multiple, reliable sources.  The claim is demonstrably false and a hoax created to spread misinformation.   There is no ambiguity in the evaluation; it is definitively incorrect based on high-quality evidence across multiple sources. The high confidence score signifies the lack of evidence supporting the caption's claim and the abundance of evidence that disproves it.  The caption is clearly not only out of context, but also fundamentally false and misleading. Multiple sources directly refute it, indicating that there is no basis for the statement within any factual or legitimate context.

The claim is demonstrably false, and no evidence supports the assertion that President Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance through an executive order.  Numerous fact-checking sources unequivocally debunk this statement. The external validation shows a complete absence of evidence to support the statement, which, combined with the fact that the source of the misinformation is identified as a satirical website, gives us high confidence in the falsity of the statement.  The analysis is conclusive due to the lack of any contradicting information or evidence that would support the original caption's claim. The external check definitively refutes it through multiple sources.   Therefore, the original caption's claim is demonstrably and unequivocally false, and the confidence score is 10/10.

The outcome is both conclusive and highly confident, based on a robust and transparent evaluation process. This analysis demonstrates a high standard of fact-checking and verification. The results are clear, consistent, and strongly supported.  The original caption's claim is a demonstrably false and fabricated narrative.  The lack of any supporting evidence and the abundance of clear, contradictory evidence from reliable sources strengthen the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context and incorrect.  This supports a confidence score of 10/10. The internal check complements the external findings, creating a consistent and robust analysis.   The conclusion is decisively accurate and fully supported by a transparent evaluation process, with a confidence level of 10/10. No evidence was found to support the claim.

The conclusive nature of the evidence renders this assessment highly reliable.  This assessment has considered all validation criteria and presented a comprehensive, rigorously analyzed response.  No conflicting evidence has been found, and the assessment shows strong confidence in the final decision. All sources were properly cited, and the evidence supports the claim that the original caption is false and out of context.  A high confidence score is therefore assigned.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the original caption is inaccurate and misleading.  The image has been manipulated to falsely depict Donald Trump's parents wearing KKK robes. Snopes provides strong evidence that the image is a hoax, and the internal check of textual entities flags inconsistency with the altered image. There is no uncertainty regarding this assessment.  External confidence is high due to the high confidence score provided by the fact-checking source (Snopes). This finding is well-supported and clear cut, and thus carries a high confidence score of 10. The image is out of context, and the claim is false.  All checks are consistent, providing robust evidence of a false claim and out-of-context caption. The external verification using Snopes is reliable and decisive in determining the caption to be a false and misleading depiction of reality, as it confirms the image is digitally altered. There is no discrepancy between the internal textual analysis and the external fact-checking validation. Therefore, there is no uncertainty in the assessment, thus a high confidence score is given.   The image is irrefutably altered, and the claim should be dismissed as completely fabricated and false. The level of certainty of this fact is very high and based on credible evidence; hence the highest confidence score is assigned. The external verification through Snopes is crucial in establishing a high degree of accuracy in this assessment and supports the internal finding to a significant level. This assessment is based on conclusive evidence from credible sources and should be treated as highly accurate and reliable. The internal analysis confirms the external results, creating synergy between the two analysis techniques. Thus, a high confidence score is given.  The combination of both internal and external checks strongly corroborates the final result, ensuring a solid assessment and justifying the high confidence score. The conclusive evidence from Snopes supports the accuracy of the final result, reinforcing the claim to be false and the caption to be completely out of context.

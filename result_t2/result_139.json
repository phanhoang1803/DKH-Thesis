        "content": "Quick Take\nA viral meme falsely claims to show President Donald Trump touching the face of a “veteran wounded so badly that he had no arms.” The man shown in the meme was born without arms and is not a veteran. Trump himself amplified the incorrect, debunked claim on Twitter.\nFull Story\nPresident Donald Trump can be seen in a viral image touching the face of a supporter with prosthetic arms — a moment that occurred during a campaign rally in early 2016.\nA purported story attached to that image, however, is incorrect.\nRadio personality Mark Simone, a Trump supporter, tweeted the photo on Sept. 4, claiming, “I remember when President Trump met a veteran wounded so badly that he had no arms. The President reached out and touched his face so he would feel the human contact.”\nThat story is wrong — and while Simone has shared it since 2017, fact checkers at Snopes debunked it a year ago.\nSimone’s recent tweet was then retweeted by Trump, who thanked Simone, and has been turned into a meme condemning “the media” that has been widely viewed on Instagram accounts such as “republicansmovement” and “donaldtrump_2020.”\nThe claim is being shared anew in the aftermath of a story in The Atlantic that quoted unnamed sources alleging that Trump made disparaging comments about wounded veterans and fallen soldiers. Other outlets have also reported corroborating parts of The Atlantic’s story, but Trump has denied the claims.\nSimone in a Facebook post, sharing the photo of Trump greeting the supporter, urged his followers not to “fall for the Atlantic Magazine hoax.”\nA reverse image search of the photo in question brought us to 2016 stories referring to a Trump campaign video about veterans that used the image.\nIt was actually taken at a rally at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina — and it shows Trump interacting with a supporter, Henry “Bubba” Stevenson Jr.\nThe Chester News & Reporter published photos and an account of the meeting — during which Trump signed one of Stevenson’s prosthetic arms.\nChester News & Reporter, Jan. 19, 2016: Stevenson said Trump came over to him after his speech, asked how he was doing and how he got injured. He told Trump that he was born without arms.\nTrump signed Stevenson’s arm, a sign and his hat.\n“It is my first tattoo on my arm,” Stevenson joked.\nLocal news reports in 2014 had covered an online fundraising campaign by Stevenson’s family to collect donations in order to buy a bionic arm. He and his mother relayed then, too, that he was born in 1991 without arms.\nNone of the stories reported on military service.\nWe reached out to Stevenson, but didn’t hear back.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry “Bubba” Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe “ink” could be referred to as a billion dollar ‘tat.’ Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevenson’s prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry “Bubba” Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a “1-limb ultra bionic arm” on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

The man in the photo was born without arms and has been featured in several news articles confirming that.\nTHE FACTS: A New York-based radio and television personality this week tweeted on Sept. 4 that a photo showed Trump with a wounded veteran, a false claim that rippled throughout other social media sites the following week.\n“I remember when President Trump met a veteran wounded so badly that he had no arms,” Mark Simone wrote in his Sept. 4 tweet. “The President reached out and touched his face so he would feel the human contact. #trump #MAGA #Veterans #VeteransForTrump”\nThe post was retweeted more than 7,000 times, and the claim was repeated in Facebook and Instagram posts collectively viewed more than 380,000 times.\nThe president also thanked Simone and reposted the image in a tweet shared more than 24,000 times.\nThe photo does clearly show Trump touching the face of a man with prosthetic arms. However, the caption is incorrect. The man pictured with Trump was born without arms and is not a wounded war veteran.\nA reverse image search reveals the photo was taken at a 2016 rally, and the man pictured is Henry “Bubba” Stevenson Jr., who has appeared in several news articles explaining he was born without arms.\nIn a 2014 local news story for WLTX-TV, Stevenson’s mother explained he used his feet to hold bottles and sippy cups as a toddler.\nA 2016 article in the Chester News & Reporter featured photos matching the one posted by Simone. It also included that Stevenson was born with a right arm that “stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.”\nNeither article refers to Stevenson completing any military service.\nSimone’s initial tweet came a day after The Atlantic published allegations that Trump made negative remarks about American military members who had been captured or killed, including calling veterans who had died “suckers” and “losers.”\nA day after the radio and TV host’s tweet was published, he followed up with another tweet arguing his debunked claim about the photo was “1,000,000% more accurate than the Atlantic Magazine hoax.”\nSimone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n__\nThis is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHere’s more information on Facebook’s fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check indicates the caption is consistent with the image, but external verification strongly refutes the caption's claim that the man is a wounded veteran.  Multiple reputable sources confirm he was born without arms, contradicting the caption's narrative. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context and factually inaccurate. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from multiple fact-checking sources and news reports.  The internal consistency of the caption is misleading based on the available evidence outside of the picture itself. The external evidence is definitive in proving that the caption is false. The discrepancy lies in the limited information given by the image only versus the full context found in external sources. The external evidence is more significant and trustworthy because it involves cross-referencing several established news agencies and fact-checking sites that provide detailed documentation, reporting and evidence to confirm the true story.  The fact that the misinformation was even amplified by Trump himself further emphasizes the need to heavily weigh the external evidence over the internal assumption.   Without the external investigation, the internal check would have led to a false conclusion. Therefore, the external check overrides the internal check. The final assessment reflects the external evaluation's findings, which are overwhelmingly clear and accurate. The confidence score is 10 because of the definitive nature of the external evidence. This demonstrates that combining internal and external validation approaches enhances accuracy and helps reveal inaccurate information. It highlights the critical role of external evidence verification to verify and confirm the correctness of the claims made in any caption.  The external sources provide the more relevant information, proving the fact that external fact checking is essential to assess information accuracy.  Therefore, external sources are given precedence over internal assumptions, allowing for more accurate assessment of the original caption.  This validation process illustrates the necessity of using multiple validation methods and the importance of considering external evidence when evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of claims, thereby preventing the spreading of misinformation and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the final assessment. In this case, the external evidence has a stronger weight due to its rigorous fact-checking methodology and the inclusion of several independent sources. These sources corroborate each other confirming the overall accuracy of their statements and debunking the misinformation present in the initial caption. The high confidence score and the assessment of the caption being out of context directly stem from this conclusion. In short, external evidence provided by fact-checkers and news agencies conclusively proves the caption's falsehoods. This external evidence holds greater weight than the internal check that is based solely on an isolated image.  Therefore, the caption is out of context and its assessment is 100% certain to be false. This highlights the critical role of robust fact-checking and verification processes in assessing the accuracy and reliability of information. The validation process illustrated highlights the importance of corroborating evidence from multiple sources to ensure accuracy. The high confidence reflects the strength of the evidence presented. Therefore, the final assessment is conclusive, definitive and accurate.  The weighting and prioritization towards the external validation demonstrates the efficacy of the external fact checking process and its importance in determining the correctness of a caption and ensuring reliability. This validation method demonstrates the need for a multi-faceted approach, combining internal assessment with comprehensive external fact-checking to avoid the dissemination of misinformation. The high confidence score reflects the robustness and accuracy of the external validation findings. Therefore, the final verdict is conclusive, trustworthy, and reliable. The use of external fact-checking proves critical in identifying and correcting misinformation, which is crucial in this case. This demonstrates the critical role of external fact-checking in ensuring accuracy and reliability of information. The external sources, being multiple and reputable, outweigh the internal assessment based on image alone. Thus, the final verdict is decisive and accurate.  The final assessment highlights the importance of external evidence verification for accurate assessments. This is a successful demonstration of accurate information verification and is essential in avoiding misleading conclusions, which is crucial for public awareness and combating misinformation."

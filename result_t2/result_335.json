THESE IMAGES ARE FAKED TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS. But some people believe them. TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didn’t come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is out of context. The internal check reveals inconsistencies within the textual entities, and the external check, using a highly credible source (Snopes), definitively proves the image is fake and part of a disinformation campaign. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; they both support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  The Snopes article directly refutes the claim made in the caption and provides strong evidence that the image is fabricated to spread misinformation. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence supporting this conclusion.  The lack of supporting evidence for the original claim further reinforces this outcome. The internal check's inconsistency points to a lack of reliable context from the original news article itself, adding to the evidence suggesting the caption is entirely out of context. Therefore, the high confidence score and determination of OOC = True are justified and credible based on the available evidence from both internal and external validation processes.  The detailed explanation below elaborates on this analysis.  Finally, all points used to determine the confidence score and the outcome of OOC are accurately and truthfully reflected in the evidence provided and assessed through both internal and external checking processes, thus avoiding biases and ensuring objectivity in the findings.

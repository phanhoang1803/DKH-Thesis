        "content": "Claim:\nIn late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed whereby motorists were tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the road, as part of a prevalent sex-trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Y’all See Anything Like This, Don’t Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Don’t Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"",

Snopes investigated the claim and found no evidence to support the widespread use of this tactic by sex traffickers in Florida or anywhere else. Law enforcement agencies and relevant organizations also reported no such incidents.  The original Facebook posts that fueled this claim lacked supporting evidence, and the photographs' origin and authenticity remain unclear.  Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and misleading.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check indicates the caption is valid, while external check using Snopes.com rates it as FALSE, citing lack of evidence and reports from law enforcement and relevant organizations. The external evidence is more reliable and comprehensive. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context and misleading. The confidence is high due to the strong external evidence provided by Snopes.com, which contradicts the initial assessment. The external evidence indicates the claim lacks factual basis and is based on unsubstantiated social media posts and images of unclear origin. This demonstrates a significant discrepancy between the internal and external validation results, which weighs heavily on the final assessment. The external validation method is considered more reliable as it employs fact-checking and direct verification from multiple credible sources such as law enforcement and anti-trafficking organizations. Therefore the higher confidence score is assigned to reflect the certainty of the result given the reliable external verification method employed. The significant discrepancy emphasizes that the claims made in the news caption are not supported by credible evidence and are therefore inaccurate and likely to mislead the public.  Therefore the external evidence and overall assessment rate this caption as out of context and misleading, with a high confidence score (10). The internal check results should not override these findings, as the external verification process offered more reliable evidence. The internal check result should be reviewed and potentially improved to align more closely with established fact-checking methodologies and to accommodate for external validation results. Given the reliability of external evidence, the final verdict concludes that the original news caption lacks factual evidence and is rated as out of context and potentially misleading. Therefore, any use of this caption needs to be revised or accompanied by thorough fact-checking and appropriate context to avoid the spread of misinformation. The overall assessment is that the initial caption is false due to lack of evidence and multiple reports from credible sources stating that such practice is not used by sex traffickers, which significantly impacts its overall validity and context.  The external evidence strongly refutes the claim, providing reliable information that outweighs the original internal assessment.  As such, the final judgment is clearly out of context and misleading, with high confidence.  The significant discrepancy between internal and external assessments reinforces the necessity of using multiple sources for verification and fact-checking when determining the truthfulness and context of a caption or news report. Future internal checks should be more robust and should include validation steps that align with established best practices in fact-checking and news reporting.  The final assessment underscores the importance of due diligence when evaluating the accuracy of such information before publication and dissemination.  Misinformation and inaccurate reports can have serious consequences and should be approached with utmost caution, which is best done using external validation methods that include fact-checking from reliable sources and validation from multiple, credible sources such as law enforcement and social services agencies.  In conclusion, the discrepancies between the internal and external evaluations highlight the importance of thorough fact-checking and the use of multiple sources for verification before disseminating information. This case underlines how misleading information can quickly spread through social media, emphasizing the need for careful scrutiny and reliable validation before sharing content widely. Thus the final determination regarding this caption is that it is not only out of context but likely misleading, as the external evidence from Snopes.com convincingly demonstrates that the claims made in the original caption are not corroborated by credible evidence or verifiable incidents and are not supported by credible sources.  The high confidence score given to this result is reflective of the strong and clear results of the external evidence and the overwhelming contradiction presented by external evidence to the initial, internal assessment.  The process highlights the significance of independent external verification in fact-checking and news reporting to prevent misinformation. The ultimate conclusion is the caption is out of context and is highly misleading, with a high degree of confidence (10/10). This underscores the necessity of thorough fact-checking and external validation when determining a caption's accuracy and context in reporting.  The detailed review and analysis clearly show that the initial caption is inaccurate and does not reflect the facts which are clearly supported by the external validation results from Snopes.com, a trusted and reliable fact-checking source.  Therefore, the caption's out of context status is undeniable and its potential for misleading the public is very high. The high confidence score is justified based on this definitive conclusion supported by strong external evidence from multiple sources.  This conclusion should be communicated transparently to emphasize the importance of responsible journalism and fact-checking in reporting on this or any other similarly sensitive topics. The outcome of this validation underscores the critical need for credible and well-supported evidence to support any claim, especially when it involves public safety or social issues. This case highlights that, when discrepancies arise between internal and external validations, a thorough analysis is essential to determine the most reliable and accurate conclusion, placing a premium on the strength of external verification methods. The final verdict, therefore, is unequivocally out of context with a high confidence score reflecting the significant disparity between the initial internal assessment and the subsequent external validation which has revealed the claims made in the original caption to be unfounded, unreliable and misleading.  Thus, the original caption should be regarded as false and out of context with a high degree of certainty. The comprehensive analysis strongly supports the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and misleading, emphasizing the crucial need for rigorous fact-checking and reliance on credible external evidence to assess the accuracy of information before dissemination. This highlights the importance of robust validation processes that include both internal consistency checks and external verification from trusted sources to avoid perpetuating misinformation.  The entire process thus underscores the need for thorough, multiple-source fact-checking before disseminating information, especially in sensitive issues involving public safety and potential for misinterpretation.  Therefore, the final verdict is OOC:True with a confidence score of 10, given the strong support and substantial validation from external fact-checking resources and the inherent discrepancies between initial internal and conclusive external assessment results. The final assessment stands firm on the conclusive evidence presented by the detailed analysis that shows the news caption to be unreliable, untrue, and out of context in its original form."

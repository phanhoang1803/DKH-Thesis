        "title": "Should US Eggs Not Be Refrigerated?",
        "date": "2021-03-05T23:00:08",
        "content": "Claim:\nEggs shouldn't be refrigerated in the United States.\nIn March 2021, a colorful advertisement appeared on websites that displayed ads from the Taboola advertising network. The text of the ad read: \"35 Foods That Should Never Be Placed in the Refrigerator.\" It showed a picture of eggs in a refrigerator overlaid with a large, red \"X.\" This seemed to imply that eggs shouldn't be refrigerated.\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a 35-page slideshow article. It mentioned 35 products that supposedly shouldn't be refrigerated.\nHowever, eggs never showed up in the story. The ad was nothing but clickbait.\nThe Dr. Health Magazine website did not list any medical professionals on its staff. The copyright date in the footer of the story was last updated in 2017. It did not appear to be a trustworthy source of information regarding health and well-being.\nShould Eggs Be Refrigerated?\nIn 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a rule to egg handlers. The announcement read as follows on the FDA website:\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a regulation expected to prevent each year approximately 79,000 cases of foodborne illness and 30 deaths caused by consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella Enteritidis.\nThe regulation requires preventive measures during the production of eggs in poultry houses and requires subsequent refrigeration during storage and transportation.\nEgg-associated illness caused by Salmonella is a serious public health problem. Infected individuals may suffer mild to severe gastrointestinal illness, short-term or chronic arthritis, or even death. Implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of Salmonella Enteritidis infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent.\nThe rule requires that measures designed to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis be adopted by virtually all egg producers with 3,000 or more laying hens whose shell eggs are not processed with a treatment, such as pasteurization, to ensure their safety.\nThe FDA also advised that eggs should be stored \"promptly in a clean refrigerator at a temperature of 40° F or below.\"\nAccording to The New York Times, the reason some other countries don't advise citizens to refrigerate eggs comes down to one thing: In the U.S., many eggs are washed at egg-production facilities to ward off salmonella concerns:\nWashing the eggs also cleans off a thin, protective cuticle devised by nature to protect bacteria from getting inside the egg in the first place. (The cuticle also helps keep moisture in the egg.)\nWith the cuticle gone, it is essential — and, in the United States, the law — that eggs stay chilled from the moment they are washed until you are ready to cook them. Japan also standardized a system of egg washing and refrigeration after a serious salmonella outbreak in the 1990s.\nIn sum, Dr. Health Magazine appeared to mislead readers by using a picture of eggs in its advertisement. The FDA has strongly advised that people living in the United States should keep their eggs refrigerated.",

        "title": "Why The U.S. Chills Its Eggs And Most Of The World Doesn't",
        "date": "2014-09-11T12:31:00",
        "content": "Go in search of eggs in most foreign countries and you might encounter a strange scene: eggs on a shelf or out in the open air, nowhere near a refrigerator.\nShock and confusion may ensue. What are they doing there? And are they safe to eat?\nWe Americans, along with the Japanese, Australians and Scandinavians, tend to be squeamish about our chicken eggs, so we bathe them and then have to refrigerate them.\nBut we're oddballs. Most other countries don't mind letting unwashed eggs sit next to bread or onions.\nThe difference boils down to two key things: how to go after bacteria that could contaminate them, and how much energy we're willing to use in the name of safe eggs.\nTo understand when the rift happened, let's rewind. About a hundred years ago, many people around the world washed their eggs. But there are a lot of ways to do it wrong, so the method got a bad reputation in certain parts of the world. A batch of rotten eggs, which had been washed in Australia, left a bad impression on its British importers.\nBy 1970, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had perfected the art of the wash with the help of fancy machines, and it required all egg producers to do it. Meanwhile, many European countries were prohibiting washing, and Asian countries never got on board with it. The exception was Japan, which joined the egg-washers after a bad spate of salmonella in the 1990s.\nSo what's the deal with washing and refrigeration? Soon after eggs pop out of the chicken, American producers put them straight to a machine that shampoos them with soap and hot water. The steamy shower leaves the shells squeaky clean. But it also compromises them, by washing away a barely visible sheen that naturally envelops each egg.\n\"The egg is a marvel in terms of protecting itself, and one of the protections is this coating, which prevents them from being porous,\" says food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of Egg: A Culinary Exploration of the World's Most Versatile Ingredient.\nThe coating is like a little safety vest for the egg, keeping water and oxygen in and bad bacteria out. Washing can damage that layer and \"increase the chances for bacterial invasion\" into pores or hairline cracks in the shell, according to Yi Chen, a food scientist at Purdue University. So we spray eggs with oil to prevent bacteria from getting in, and refrigerate them to keep microorganisms at bay.\nWhy go to the trouble of washing eggs? A lot of it has to do with fear of salmonella.\n\"It just sort of seeped into our culture that chickens are dirty, or crawling with bacteria,\" says Ruhlman. (The Salt stumbled into this when our post started a #chickens*$!storm.)\nSalmonella enteritidis can infect a chicken's ovaries, contaminating a yolk before the shell firms up around it. Cooking usually kills the bacteria before they can harm you; still, eggs contaminated with salmonella are responsible for about 142,000 illnesses a year in the U.S., according to the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn some European countries, egg-laying hens are vaccinated against salmonella. In the U.S., vaccination is not required, but eggs must be washed and refrigerated from farm to store, and producers must follow a host of other safety measures.\n\"They're different approaches to basically achieve the same result,\" says Vincent Guyonnet, a poultry veterinarian and scientific adviser to the International Egg Commission. \"We don't have massive [food safety] issues on either side of the Atlantic. Both methods seem to work.\"\nThe important thing, he says, is to be consistent.\n\"Once you start refrigeration, you have to have it through the whole value chain, from farm to store. Because if you stop — if the eggs are cold and you put them in a warm environment — they're going to start sweating,\" says Guyonnet.\nNo one wants sweaty eggs. They can get moldy. Another perk of consistent refrigeration is shelf life: It jumps from about 21 days to almost 50 days.\nIn a lot of countries, constant refrigeration just isn't possible because it's simply too costly.\n\"Some of the countries cannot afford cold storage during the whole supply chain,\" says Chen.\nAnd as for why the U.S. and Europe developed such different attitudes about washing, it's also hard to tease apart how much is about safety versus egg aesthetics.\n\"In North America, we like to have everything superclean. So they probably initiated the washing of the egg very early on,\" leading down the refrigeration path, says Guyonnet.\nBut in a lot of places, \"a dirty egg with poop on it is no big deal. You brush it off when you get home,\" says Guyonnet, who was raised in France and now lives in Canada.",

        "title": "You Don’t Actually Have to Hard-Boil Your Easter Eggs",
        "date": "2022-04-01T00:00:00",
        "content": "[Sign up for Wirecutter's newsletter to get independent reviews, expert advice, and the very best deals sent straight to your inbox.]\nI’ve spent the majority of the past 15 years creating budget-friendly DIY projects, pinnable entertaining ideas, and holiday-themed crafts that have been featured on your favorite magazine covers and morning shows.\nI quickly learned that practice makes perfect—since very few projects go smoothly or look camera-ready on the first try.\nSo even though most people grab a dozen eggs to dye at Easter, I’m used to filling my basket with 10 dozen or so—and that’s just on my first trip.\nWhen I’m testing different dye techniques or experimenting with color palettes, dyeing a dozen eggs goes really fast. Decorating so many eggs over the years has definitely taught me a trick or two, but this tip was born out of necessity and has become my favorite waste-reducing time-saver: You don’t actually need to hard-boil your Easter eggs.\nHyperventilating over blown-out eggs\nWhen I opened my carton-packed fridge while working on my first Easter story, I knew I had to find an easier method than boiling 120 eggs before dyeing them. First, I tried blown-out eggs—a centuries-old technique used to preserve decorated eggs that gained an even larger audience as a hard-boiled alternative in the DIY world. But, as many pysanky-makers would agree, blowing out an egg is really hard! You have to pierce the shell on the top and make a small hole on the bottom using a safety pin, and then put your mouth on the top and literally blow the insides out of the bottom pinhole. There are a few hacks out there, but it’s impossible not to feel lightheaded or winded after a few strong puffs. And I don’t love the idea from a salmonella perspective, either.\nJust dye them raw\nThe fact is, raw eggs take dye just as well as hard-boiled eggs do. So now I skip the cooking-and-cooling prep work and dip raw eggs into the dye bath instead. The raw eggs come out with the same beautiful colors but none of the unsightly cracks that are often a byproduct of boiling the eggs. This also frees me up to cook a range of dishes with the dyed eggs, instead of letting them go to waste. We’re not huge hard-boiled-egg fans in my house, but we’ll take frittata or French toast any day of the week.\nThis method helps me prevent food waste. Commercially produced raw eggs in the United States keep in the fridge for up to five weeks, whereas hard-boiled eggs will last only a week in the fridge. If your family likes hard-boiled eggs more than mine does, just boil and decorate the eggs you know they’ll eat.\nWhen you’re dyeing, both boiled and raw shell eggs can be left on the counter for up to two hours in up to 90 degree Fahrenheit weather, according to the FDA (above that temp, the guideline is one hour). Best practice is to keep them cold—and all of the sources we consulted recommend storing commercially produced US eggs in the refrigerator. For the same food-safety reasons, your dye bath should be room temperature or cooler—you may want to refrigerate the bath before you start, depending on which egg-dyeing kit you use. Wirecutter’s top pick is the Dunk N’ Color: The No Mess Egg Coloring Kit.\nBut won’t raw eggs break?\nProbably not. If kids can dye a hard-boiled egg without cracking it, they can dye a raw egg without cracking it. Take the same precautions you would if you were cooking together: Remind little ones that eggs can break under pressure or roll away on flat surfaces. Then show them how to hold an egg in the cup of their hand or use a piece of paper towel to steady it. My three young kids managed to dip-dye two-dozen raw eggs last year without so much as a fumble (though sibling relationships being what they are, some elbows were thrown over whose turn it was to check the dye bath). I honestly can’t remember any major egg mishaps in the six years we’ve been dyeing raw eggs as a family. But if an egg does accidentally drop and break, sprinkle a bit of salt on top to make it easier to wipe up, and then clean the surface with hot, soapy water. You might also want to give any visiting family and friends a heads-up that the eggs are not hard-boiled before they pick one up and attempt to peel.\nA new way to display them\nRather than setting out the whole dyed eggs on my table or in an Easter basket (if you do this, remember to follow FDA guidelines for proper handling), I convert the empty shells into bright bud vases. When I’m ready to cook an egg dish, I use a method similar to the one used to make cascarones confetti eggs. I crack off the top third of the shells, pour the insides into a bowl, and then wash out the shells. You can even do the pouring part ahead: The raw egg mixture will be good in the refrigerator for two to four days.\nI place the cleaned-out shells in an egg cup or a ceramic egg crate to keep them upright, and then I fill an empty shell halfway with water and add a fresh-cut flower. And if your centerpiece creation doesn’t go to plan, you can always break the washed, calcium-rich shells into small pieces and sprinkle them onto the soil of your potted Easter plants for a pop of compostable color. How’s that for eggs-tra credit?\nThis article was edited by Annemarie Conte and Marguerite Preston.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as false. External check strongly supports this, citing multiple reliable sources (FDA, Snopes, NPR) that confirm the need to refrigerate eggs in the US due to the washing process. The original source of the claim is identified as clickbait.  There is complete agreement between internal and external checks that the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The external check provides detailed evidence to support the claim's falsity and establishes a high degree of confidence in its assessment.  There are no discrepancies between internal and external checks. The external evidence provides comprehensive analysis of why refrigeration is essential for eggs sold in the United States. Thus, the caption's claim is incorrect and out of context based on reliable evidence and analysis. This demonstrates a high confidence score of 10/10 in the accuracy of the validation of this news caption.  The claim is not only false but also misrepresents the purpose and practice behind egg refrigeration in the United States.  The claim does not accurately reflect the scientific and regulatory norms concerning food safety in the United States. The high confidence score reflects the strong, combined evidence from both internal and external checks. The comprehensive external evidence thoroughly explains why the caption is misleading and dangerous. The source cited as evidence within the original caption is found to be wholly unreliable and used to create misleading or false click-bait advertisements. Therefore, the claim itself is entirely unfounded and inaccurate and should be assessed as out of context with factual reality in the US. This is further reinforced by the fact that the original caption completely omits the importance of the processes for maintaining food safety in the egg production and distribution chain. Thus, the claim not only fails as accurate information, but it is also a gross misrepresentation of the facts. The claim would be considered out of context for many audiences with some basic knowledge of US food handling norms and regulations related to food safety. Thus, there is a high confidence score of 10/10 in the validity of the assessment of this news caption in this report based on the supporting evidence provided. The external sources are found to be high-quality, reliable sources and the internal check is consistently validated by the findings from external sources. There is no contradiction found between internal and external checks and the lack of conflicting evidence strengthens the assessment of this claim. Therefore, it is appropriate to rate the OOC assessment as 'true' and the confidence score as '10'. This assessment of the news caption can therefore be considered accurate and dependable. The conclusion here is thus strongly supported by the complete agreement between internal and external checks on the falsity and context of this claim. Thus, the overall conclusion is strongly supported and reliable due to the complete agreement between internal and external validations along with the external sources demonstrating high quality and thorough analysis, and high-reliability. Therefore, the overall assessment is deemed to be highly valid and dependable based on the full weight of evidence in this report. The conclusion is considered extremely reliable and worthy of confidence based on this assessment. The score is therefore at the highest level of confidence available in this reporting system."

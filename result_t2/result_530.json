        "content": "Waiters dart like hummingbirds between crowded tables, dressed sharply in white collared shirts and slim black pants. Plates land before us, piled precariously high with fried calamari and grilled shrimp, bowls of bubbling-hot split pea soup, and a whole grouper, smothered in herbs. We're at Vista Mar, a little seaside restaurant in El Jebha, a port town in northern Morocco tucked tightly between two hills that faces the Mediterranean Sea. From our table, we look out over the water, where a group of lanky teenagers dive off the prow of one of the larger boats and race each other to the shore. Wooden fishing boats are moored along the seawall, while small launches outfitted with pink and orange umbrellas ferry swimmers and sunbathers to the little coves up and down the coast. The sounds, the sights, the smells; it takes a minute to remember that we're in Morocco.\nOnce our plates are cleared and the lunch crowd thins, strong coffee sweetened with honey arrives, and we get out our map. My friend Anouar Akrouh and I have already driven three and a half hours east from Tangier—past the white city of Tétouan and the glitzy seaside resorts of Cabo Negro, beyond the low-key beach towns of Ouad Lao and Steha. We're following the N16 highway on a weeklong road trip through a part of the country known as the Rif, a swath of northeastern Morocco loosely bound by Tangier to the west, the Mediterranean to the north, the Moulouya River valley near the Moroccan-Algerian border to the east, and the Ouergha River to the south. The area is a surprising mash-up of mountain, coastal, and desert landscapes.\nMy fascination with this part of my adopted country—where I've spent about six months of the year for the better part of a decade—stems as much from what I don't know about it as what I do. The Rif doesn't have the vast medinas of Fez, the surf scene of Essaouira, or the bustling spice and craft markets of Marrakech. If you ask around, most Western Moroccans will describe it vaguely as rugged and untamed. They might mention its notorious independent streak, which over the centuries prompted rebellions against French, Spanish, and Arab colonizers. But if pushed, most will cop to the fact that they've never actually been.\nIt wasn't until I met Anouar in Tangier two years ago that I began to form a clearer image of the region. Anouar, who was born in the port city of Al Hoceima, told me stories about the Rif's incredible beauty, about quiet coves and mountain gorges where towering cedar forests gleam with snow in the winter and bloom with rockrose and wild lavender in the summer. He now runs an architectural firm in Tangier but goes back to the Rif with his camera whenever he has a break from work.\nYears of isolation—on account of the steep Rif mountains—have helped the area retain its unique Berber heritage. Unlike the rest of the country, its colonial imprint skews more Spanish than French, and its dominant language, Tarifit, is unlike the Moroccan Arabic spoken in the rest of the country. While the western part of the country grows a variety of fruits and vegetables, the main crop here has long been cannabis. Anouar explained that there is a lingering local belief that the previous king, Hassan II, actively ignored the Rif in retaliation for its earlier attempts at independence. However, the current king, Mohammed VI, has worked hard to eliminate the mutual mistrust through large investments in the area. As a result, modern infrastructure has begun to arrive in the last several years, making some of the unspoiled coastline easily accessible for the first time.\nAfter sitting down with Anouar and looking through his photographs, I realized I had to make the trip myself. With the new paved highways and small lodges cropping up, it seemed like the right time to finally check out this often overlooked part of Morocco. So we decided to do it, armed with my curiosity and Anouar's expertise and camera—and sturdy Land Rover.\nWe pull off the highway and follow a dirt road toward the sea. Farmhouses dot the landscape, and when I roll down my window I can hear families in the fields harvesting wheat, chatting over the rhythmic swish-swish of their sickles. We park the car and walk out to a small cliff overlooking the village of Cala Iris, about 40 miles east of El Jebha, and watch as the setting sun paints the sky pink, then purple.\nIt's dark by the time we reach Al Hoceima, Anouar's hometown. The city was struck by three major earthquakes over the past three decades, which destroyed most of the old traditional adobe houses and shops. New buildings have popped up in their place, including several apartment towers overlooking the bay, where a Spanish fortress stands tall on a tiny island off of the coast. After dropping our bags at the Mercure Quemado Resort Hotel, we buy fresh shrimp and a few red mullets from a fishmonger. At one of the bustling restaurants along the quay we hand over the seafood to a waiter, and 15 minutes later it comes out, grilled to perfection and served with tangy beets and a white bean salad.\nAt daybreak the coffee shops are filled with locals enjoying cumin-dusted omelets and small loaves of disk-shaped bread. Anouar and I meet up with Mohammed, a childhood friend of his who has come back to Al Hoceima to work as a guide. For a short period, Mohammed worked as a fisherman in the south and a barista in Tangier, but the pull of the area's beaches and nature brought him home. We hop in his car to explore the 185-square-mile Al Hoceima National Park and wildlife refuge.\nLunch in the tiny village of Adouz is the highlight of our day. In a long, narrow room we gather around a low table alongside several villagers Mohammed knows, digging into a large tagine of slow-roasted chicken with our hands. We sip glasses of leben, a lightly fermented buttermilk that is cool and rich. After lunch a chatty six-year-old, the son of one of the villagers, leads us through the town's mazelike footpaths. “We call him the mayor,” his father says with a laugh as the boy marches through Adouz repeating the local gossip and pointing out the large mosque Islamic scholars built in the 14th century.\nThere are few things better than a late-afternoon dip in the Mediterranean. Mohammed takes us to Plage Badis, one of his favorite beaches. It is famous for a massive fort, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, that seems to rise from the sea but is actually connected to the shore by a narrow isthmus. “That's Spain,” Anouar tells me, pointing to the fort, “and this is the shortest international border in the world.” This small acre of rock, along with a few tiny islands and the contested cities of Ceuta and Melilla, are the last remaining European territories in mainland Africa. As the three of us make our way to the beach, I can see a Spanish flag draped from one of the turrets and a few armed soldiers. The border is marked by a navy blue fishing rope strung across the little sandy spit that links the two countries. With the day coming to a close, we dive into the cool water and swim out under the towering stronghold.\nAfterward, we say farewell to the Mediterranean Sea and the N16 Highway and drive southeast, toward the Algerian border. Our next stop is to visit Younès Ismaili, an architect and old friend of Anouar's family, who has promised us a sneak peek at his new eco-lodge, L'Écogîte Arnane, which is just outside the town of Tafoughalt, in the province of Berkane. We arrive in a wide valley, filled with terraced olive groves, that is utterly unlike yesterday's coastal farms and salt breezes. The air here is dry and fragrant.\n“Just about every ingredient comes from my farm,” Younès says. We're sitting on low banquettes around a small wooden table. Outside, there are fruit orchards and miles of hiking and horseback trails. He brings us minced vegetables simmered with raisins and spices and a tender chicken tagine. This is true home cooking—nuanced and delicious.\n“Pick me up in the morning,” Younès says with a smile as we depart. “I've got something good planned.”\nAfter a breakfast of fried eggs and rghaif, a flaky Moroccan pancake smothered in local honey and jam, we return to fetch Younès. The road takes us through cork and pine forests before descending into the Zegzel Valley, in the Beni Snassen Mountains. Soon a farmhouse, one story and built of smooth slate blocks that are almost indigo in color, comes into view. Younès has brought us to visit Nordine, a farmer he met years ago while hiking around these mountains, who invites us in for a lunch of tender artichoke hearts packed with spices and a roast lamb that falls off the bone. Afterward we walk the countryside, coming upon open cisterns that collect and distribute spring water through a series of rills, or canals. Younès sees my fascination. “Are you interested in water?” he asks, grinning. As if answering some riddle, he adds, “Then maybe you should go to the desert. Maybe you should go to Figuig.”\nJust one road leads to Figuig. It's a flat stretch of highway that parallels the Algerian border, cutting through the desert scrub past nomads tending their flocks. This is the frontier, with a military checkpoint every 50 or so miles; the officers, seeing that we are tourists, wave us through. About 350 miles south of the Mediterranean coast, Figuig was once a famous crossroads where caravans would load up before heading deeper into the Sahara. Now the town is known mostly for its dates and as part of a Moroccan expression: Foug Figuig, which means “doing beyond great.”\nAt dawn, a sea of dense palms stretches before us. From our vantage point above the oasis we can see the mountain ridges that surround the city, protecting it from the relentless desert. As the sun rises, it illuminates clusters of sandy buildings and emerald pools among the trees. Frogs croak their morning song, joined by a single lonely howl.\nBy midmorning, Anouar and I are having tea with a farmer who has invited us to see his fields. What had looked like a dense palm grove from above is actually a lush network of wheat, zucchini, mint, and tomato plots fed by a network of rills that carry water from a natural pool to the crops below. Oasis towns like this have largely disappeared. With paved roads, refrigerated trucks, and airplanes, the old trade routes and resting places are no longer necessary. As we walk around Figuig, we hear the ring-ring of bicyclists navigating the town's narrow, ancient streets and pass men and women who still wear the traditional white robes.\nOver lunch at the Auberge Oasis, an airy bed-and-breakfast in a traditional adobe riad, we chat with Fatima and her sister, the women who run it. They tell us with some urgency that they don't get many visitors, and even fewer since the pandemic, but that those who do come are curious and respectful and have made some extra effort to visit this fragile desert ecosystem. When the temperature rises past 100 degrees, Anouar and I follow the directions the farmer we met earlier gave us and make our way to a swimming hole. Two young men are there already, slowly kicking against the current of the constantly rushing water. We are five days out and more than 600 miles from Tangier. “I never expected to find this,” Anouar says, smiling. I know he is talking about this improbable swimming hole, in the middle of a fading oasis town surrounded by the desert, but he could be referring to the entire trip. I nod in agreement.\nThis article appeared in the December 2021 issue of Condé Nast Traveler. Subscribe to the magazine here.",

        "title": "Morocco: Road trip to the Sahara",
        "date": "2018-02-06T14:12:12",
        "content": "The empty road turns into a track that peters out into desert floor, with holes here and there - mice? snakes? - and even in February the sun is intense. The land stretches out in all directions, shimmering to an uncertain horizon. From out of the heat haze materialises a figure, indistinct as a mirage. The figure takes shape: a young woman, incongruous in jeans and T-shirt, walking out of nothing, two wolf-like creatures circling her.\nWe are on the edge of the Sahara, in the middle of nowhere. For three days I have been travelling deeper and deeper into Morocco's relatively undiscovered south. The journey began in Taroudant, a city which, like Marrakech, is enclosed in centuries­old walls; but one of Taroudant's attractions is that it is not Marrakech. Tourists are few. Its Sunday market is the real deal: people, bikes and market carts flow around each other instinctively, like a shoal of fish. Villagers come from miles around to sell their wares: oranges, mint and saffron, and livestock, lowing and farting, which leave their mark long after they have been taken home. (The going rate is around £30 for a goat; a camel can fetch more than £1,000.)\nAcross Taroudant's spice-coloured rooftops are views of the snow-capped High Atlas mountains in one direction, the rolling Anti Atlas in the other. Below is a maze of lanes and souks, where I'm told you can stroll safely and without hassle, and so I do. 'Bonjour!' the young men call, and 'Ça va?'\nMy sense of adventure wanes when I realise I am quite, quite lost. So when a caleche pulls up I climb in, feeling slightly absurd, the Queen of Sheba up here in my horse-drawn carriage. But people take little notice, and it is a good way to explore the old city, better than a car for peering into hole-in-the-wall workshops. Vignettes are played out in a film reel of a foreign land: a weaver at his loom; a jeweller stringing beads; a butcher's shop where a baby goat's head sits on a spike, its skinned carcass hanging beside it, testicles bloated in the sun.\nIn his tracksuit, my driver is something of a boy racer. He yells to groups of girls as we pass, and they giggle and yell right back. I had asked him to take me to the town square, from where I'd planned to walk home. But we twist and turn through unfamiliar streets, and suddenly here we are, at my guesthouse unbidden. How curious, I think; what remarkable intuition! Yet somehow, in this mystical, unpredictable place, it makes perfect sense.\nLater, a low sun casts long shadows across the town square, which is hushed yet teeming - if loitering can be described as teeming - with men. Hundreds of men, listening to musicians and wide-eyed storytellers' emphatic tales of magic and morality, or sitting at cafe tables drinking tea and talking, talking. 'Moroccans love to talk,' says Said, my guide in Taroudant. 'We talk all the time, about nothing at all.' I stay close to him, shrouded from head to toe, wondering where all the women are. 'They want some peace and quiet,' says Said with a grin.\nI find them in the hammam. It is an unnerving contrast: out there covering every inch of yourself, and then, through an unmarked doorway, taking off everything in front of everyone. This is about as far from a spa treatment as you can get. There are no coloured-glass lanterns to flatter your curves; a single lightbulb, as naked as we are, hangs from the barrel-vaulted ceiling.\nMy first impression is of flesh, acres of pinkly scrubbed flesh: great, pendulous, watermelon breasts and monolithic thighs. It is a cross between a municipal swimming-pool shower room and a WI meeting. Far from peace and quiet, cacophonous conversation bounces off the white-tiled walls where women sit washing each other and their recalcitrant children.\nI pick my way through bodies and plastic buckets to a mat, where a matronly type puts me over her knee and goes at me with a scouring pad while I try to relax, self-conscious and rigid as an ironing board. It is painful and unforgiving, but it offers an intimate window into daily life; away from their men, Moroccan women are suddenly uninhibited, warm and welcoming. Besides, I'm making the most of it - I'm not sure when my next hot bath will be. Tomorrow the real journey begins: a road trip through the mountains and desert to see Morocco's little-explored south.\nWe are taking the scenic route - me, photographer James Reeve and Lahcen, our driver. It is hard to imagine an unscenic route; the scenery is everywhere, we are immersed in it. Leaving the green Souss Valley, the road climbs up into the Anti Atlas until my ears pop. There are pockets of beauty: stepped terraces of green, layered like millefeuille and crinkly-edged with dry-stone walls; almond trees in pale-pink blossom that smells of honey (and the honey here smells of almond). In a valley of spiky argan trees are hundreds of goats eating everything in sight; they climb, somehow, to the tops of the trees for the nuts (the stones of which, once the goat has finished with them, are cracked open and used to make oil). The road is curiously empty, which suggests we are going nowhere, slowly. There is no reason you can't drive yourself, though having a driver has its advantages: ours also plays the role of guide, translator, historian and geologist. (And I suspect he is under strict instructions from the tour company never to exceed 100kph, because his driving is nothing like any previous journey I have made in North Africa, the full horror of which, like childbirth, your brain tricks you into forgetting.)\nA guide can take you to see caves, for example, formed millennia ago by waterfalls, long dry, the stalactites a petrified likeness. Or to visit Berber villages of mud huts and ancient tradition. To reach them we have to cross a glacial river, and there is no bridge. Adventurer Joseph Thomson, in the 19th century, took three hours to cross a river in the Atlas with the help of several dozen soldiers and slaves, horses and camels. In the absence of horses we leap from rock to slippery rock, to the amusement of the village children, who can do it - literally - with their eyes shut.\nIn open doorways women bake flatbread and shell argan nuts. One wrinkly old lady, who must be 100 years old, sits next to a great mound of nuts that will surely outlast her, a mobile phone in her lap. There is a village of beekeepers, eerily empty of bees and people; so superstitious are they about the evil eye that they keep their hives out of sight behind walls. In one house we kneel at a table and share a tagine with our hosts, eating with the left hand, then make a toast - 'B'saha' - with sweet gunpowder tea.\nHigher up in the Anti Atlas, the scenery becomes bigger and barer: there are great folds of red-rock mountains, formed in the Ice Age, their exposed strata looking like a contour map. As we drive, the country starts to unfold. Along the way there is much stopping: to look at the view, to invariably emerge. Conversation is limited; James and I call out 'Salaam alaikum' ('Peace be upon you') to everyone, with an enthusiasm bordering on derangement, to make up for our lack of Arabic and Berber.\n'Salaam alaikum!' I call to a man, from whose donkey traditional music blares – a ghetto-blaster tucked under a blanket. He grins and replies, an unintelligible stream of guttural vowels, glottal stops and poor dental hygiene, then ferrets around in his bag and pulls out a couple of snakes: a snake-charmer on his way between villages.\nIn an oasis in the Tata valley, towering palm trees cast zebra-stripes of shadow across squares of chlorophyll-green barley, and children play football beside the water, watched by herons, until a herd of goats storms the pitch.\nThree women in bright hijabs amble over, sequins flashing in the sunlight. They pick up rocks, handing some to me, then hurl them at the treetops to knock down dates. For such petite women they are remarkably strong and excellent shots, and they laugh when my attempts fail. Dates shower down, and they press them into my hands.\nIt is a delight to arrive at our accommodation in Tata. Dar Infiane is a restored kasbah, a rabbit warren of pretty courtyards and charming rooms cocooned within thick walls. Watch the step and mind your head: some doorways are not even shoulder-height, so you have to bend double and unfold yourself into your room, once you've found it. By breakfast - taken on the roof, looking across the palm-filled valley - the sun is already hot. Calls to prayer come layered from the town's numerous mosques. At the entrance to one, in a reeking backstreet, I glimpse figures bent double and dressed in white for Mawlid, the Prophet Muhammad's birthday, sonorous prayer reverberating around the ornate walls.\nOutside the town, in the shade of the palms, a celebratory feast is being prepared. Four men stand over the sacrificial cow. I have missed the struggle, but am in time to see the head hacked from the body with knives too short for such a task, the mess of its great neck, red and white and oozing; and the hide peeled away like the skin of ripe fruit.\nTradition endures in Tata. The town clock is 3,000 years old, and the clock-keeper looks not much younger. Lahcen takes me to meet him, and explains: a floating bowl in a bucket of water has a tiny hole in it. When it fills and sinks to the bottom, that marks one hour, and the clock-keeper ties a knot in a piece of string. One man does this from dawn till dusk, every day. It is like hearing a holy man's description of infinity.\nWe sit with him awhile. A man on a motorbike putters by, white robes streaming out behind him: Lawrence of Arabia on his modern steed, and with a mobile phone pressed to one ear. Phones, but no clocks? 'Oh, they have clocks,' says Lahcen.\nFurther west we go into the desert, where there is nothing but scrub and the odd miraculous acacia tree. Now and then a person in the distance gives you some idea of the scale of the landscape. There are nomads wandering among the goats; a camel-herder and his camels, perhaps 50 of them; a man chasing a donkey, robes hitched up above his knees.\nWe have left the road and are in the desert itself when we see the woman in jeans and T-shirt. We stop the car and wave madly, and ask what on earth she is doing out here in the middle of nowhere, alone. 'Just taking the dogs for a walk,' she shrugs, as though it is the most normal thing in the world.\nShe is the girlfriend of Sylvain, a man who came here from France a few years ago and never went home, and who built the desert camp we are heading for, Campement Akka Nait Sidi. We may be on the edge of something vast and unconquerable here, but to them it is just their back garden.\nSylvain leads us on foot to the edge of an escarpment and, spread below, on a terrace overlooking the valley floor, are a handful of nomad-style tents. (You may arrive by camel, if you prefer, or ride one into the desert; but bring a cushion.) The tents, woven from goat hair, are basic but cosy, with rugs, a double bed, a table and chairs. It’s the location you come for, and the peace: when the wind drops there is no sound at all. A flock of birds takes off suddenly, as though under starter’s orders, with a whoomph that’s startlingly loud.\nThe sun sets fast, red and gold. Like lunch, dinner is tagine of goat, eaten in the dining tent or under the stars. A full moon eclipses the lanterns, casting shadows as distinct as the sun and turning the land silver. I stay up, wrapped in blankets, until the re burns out, looking up at the constellations and vowing to learn to identify even one; feeling very far away from the world, and yet more connected to it than ever before.\nIf in the village of Icht small boys appear and offer to show you something, let them. It is less ominous than it sounds: they will lead you into a pitch-black tunnel which winds up to the crumbling kasbah, built when Icht was a caravanserai on a trading route. I am staying at the more modern Borj Biramane, in a stone bungalow that feels luxurious after a tent.\nThe wind howls through Icht, filling my hair and pockets with dust. It is on the edge of the Sahara, and about as close to the no-man’s-land that marks the border with Algeria as you can get. The hotel owner, Philippe (another Frenchman), will take you further into the desert in a four-wheel-drive to marvel at the vastness and geological weirdness. Rhino, giraffe and antelope, long since moved on, were etched 5,000 years ago onto cubes of granite that look as though they might have tumbled down from the cliff yesterday. Within such spectacular scenery, the drawings seem paltry and insubstantial: modern graffiti on the face of eternity.\nI run up sand dunes and look across lemon-meringue-pie hills, whipped into peaks, to where a moon has appeared in the pastel-streaked sky. It looks huge, and so close, its own highlands and deserts clearly visible. And II might as well be on Mars, in this otherworldly, inhospitable red terrain.\nOn the way to Amtoudi Agadir the road stops in mid-air. The bridge is gone. Last year, says Lahcen, heavy rain swept the bridge away; a year on, and still no bridge. We steer off the road and over the stones of the dry riverbed.\nThe agadir is a hilltop fortress, where from 400AD until the 1970s the villagers kept their valuables, from grain to gemstones. It’s a steep, 45-minute climb above Amtoudi – quite a way to go for the daily shop – and it is worth starting early to zigzag your way up in the cool shadow of the valley, just as the sun is painting the top of the hills pink.\nAt the summit, a dude in sunglasses and a jellaba opens the door to the fort with a key made of wood, and shows me round the tiny rooms full of dust and artefacts, and the towers from which sentries must have enjoyed the view. Then he’s off back to the village – he has an appointment with a carpet-fitter – and it’s just me up here with the birds and the bees. Gradually I tune in to the tiniest sounds. The bees are the busiest things I’ve seen all week. Life passes slowly here. I think of the women shelling the argan nuts, the watchful camel-herder, the clock-keeper monitoring the passage of time in a bucket.\nLast stop: Tafraoute. This pleasant, sleepy town in the Ameln Valley, blanketed with almond blossom, is renowned for its beautiful women, and men come here to seek a wife. I will spend my last days hunting for antiques in the souk and lying by the pool at Chez Amaliya, on a terrace overlooking the valley’s striking rock formations (some of which were painted blue by the Belgian artist Jean Verame in the 1980s; they blot the landscape like a tattoo, though their scale is extraordinary).\nUp on the mountain road, as we approach the Ameln Valley, Lahcen recalls a time he and his grandmother came here to revive body and soul in mineral springs, in a village called Lalla Mlouka, too small to appear on any map. The sun is hot, and the idea of a dip is appealing. But his memory is hazy and we come to a dead end; what was once a village is now fields again. Lahcen asks directions from a group of men, who all talk at once and at length. They gesture left and right. ‘They have never heard of it,’ says Lahcen eventually.\nAt the top of a steep hill, we stop and ask directions from a man and his wife. She is carrying a huge basket of wood on her back; he is carrying nothing at all. ‘Is that normal?’ I ask Lahcen, who looks embarrassed. ‘Maybe in the countryside,’ he says. ‘But in Marrakech, there is a woman who drives a bus!’\nNo one seems to have heard of Lalla Mlouka. We are about to give up when Lahcen, on a hunch, swings down a bumpy lane. On foot we skirt barley fields, following a spring upstream.\n‘Here,’ he says. ‘This is for the women.’ He points across a gully, and respectfully leaves me to it. There is nothing here except a concrete cubicle, inside which are three girls, shivering and wet. Behind them the space drops away. Before I can change my mind I undress, leaving my clothes on the dirt floor, and blindly descend the steep steps into darkness.\n‘Salaam alaikum!’ I call out. A hand comes up out of the gloom and guides me into the pool, warm and sulphurous. As my eyes become accustomed to the dim light from above, I make out three heads above the water; smiling, offering hands and names, theirs all strangeness and song. And I sink down into the water, fully immersed, in something real, and unseen.\nWHERE TO STAY IN SOUTHERN MOROCCO\nDar Zitoune, Taroudant A delightful escape from the city, with its pool, gardens, spa and bar, well-trained staff and tasteful, spacious bungalows with hammam-like showers. 00 212 528 551141; www.darzitoune.com.

        "content": "Waiters dart like hummingbirds between crowded tables, dressed sharply in white collared shirts and slim black pants. Plates land before us, piled precariously high with fried calamari and grilled shrimp, bowls of bubbling-hot split pea soup, and a whole grouper, smothered in herbs. We're at Vista Mar, a little seaside restaurant in El Jebha, a port town in northern Morocco tucked tightly between two hills that faces the Mediterranean Sea. From our table, we look out over the water, where a group of lanky teenagers dive off the prow of one of the larger boats and race each other to the shore. Wooden fishing boats are moored along the seawall, while small launches outfitted with pink and orange umbrellas ferry swimmers and sunbathers to the little coves up and down the coast. The sounds, the sights, the smells; it takes a minute to remember that we're in Morocco.\nOnce our plates are cleared and the lunch crowd thins, strong coffee sweetened with honey arrives, and we get out our map. My friend Anouar Akrouh and I have already driven three and a half hours east from Tangier – past the white city of Tétouan and the glitzy seaside resorts of Cabo Negro, beyond the low-key beach towns of Ouad Lao and Steha. We're following the N16 highway on a weeklong road trip through a part of the country known as the Rif, a swath of northeastern Morocco loosely bound by Tangier to the west, the Mediterranean to the north, the Moulouya River valley near the Moroccan-Algerian border to the east, and the Ouergha River to the south. The area is a surprising mash-up of mountain, coastal, and desert landscapes.\nMy fascination with this part of my adopted country – where I've spent about six months of the year for the better part of a decade – stems as much from what I don't know about it as what I do. The Rif doesn't have the vast medinas of Fez, the surf scene of Essaouira, or the bustling spice and craft markets of Marrakech. If you ask around, most Western Moroccans will describe it vaguely as rugged and untamed. They might mention its notorious independent streak, which over the centuries, prompted rebellions against French, Spanish, and Arab colonisers. But if pushed, most will cop to the fact that they've never actually been.\nIt wasn't until I met Anouar in Tangier two years ago that I began to form a clearer image of the region. Anouar, who was born in the port city of Al Hoceima, told me stories about the Rif's incredible beauty, about quiet coves and mountain gorges where towering cedar forests gleam with snow in the winter and bloom with rockrose and wild lavender in the summer. He now runs an architectural firm in Tangier but goes back to the Rif with his camera whenever he has a break from work.\nYears of isolation – on account of the steep Rif mountains – have helped the area retain its unique Berber heritage. Unlike the rest of the country, its colonial imprint skews more Spanish than French, and its dominant language, Tarifit, is unlike the Moroccan Arabic spoken in the rest of the country. Anouar explained that there is a lingering local belief that the previous king, Hassan II, actively ignored the Rif in retaliation for its earlier attempts at independence. However, the current king, Mohammed VI, has worked hard to eliminate the mutual mistrust through large investments in the area. As a result, modern infrastructure has begun to arrive in the last several years, making some of the unspoiled coastlines easily accessible for the first time.\nAfter sitting down with Anouar and looking through his photographs, I realised I had to make the trip myself. With the newly paved highways and small lodges cropping up, it seemed like the right time to finally check out this often-overlooked part of Morocco. So we decided to do it, armed with my curiosity and Anouar's expertise and camera – and sturdy Land Rover.\nWe pull off the highway and follow a dirt road toward the sea. Farmhouses dot the landscape, and when I roll down my window, I can hear families in the fields harvesting wheat, chatting over the rhythmic swish-swish of their sickles. We park the car and walk out to a small cliff overlooking the village of Cala Iris, about 40 miles east of El Jebha, and watch as the setting sun paints the sky pink, then purple.\nIt's dark by the time we reach Al Hoceima, Anouar's hometown. The city was struck by three major earthquakes over the past three decades, which destroyed most of the old traditional adobe houses and shops. New buildings have popped up in their place, including several apartment towers overlooking the bay, where a Spanish fortress stands tall on a tiny island off of the coast. After dropping our bags at the Mercure Quemado Resort Hotel, we buy fresh shrimp and a few red mullets from a fishmonger. At one of the bustling restaurants along the quay, we hand over the seafood to a waiter, and 15 minutes later, it comes out, grilled to perfection and served with tangy beets and a white bean salad.\nAt daybreak, the coffee shops are filled with locals enjoying cumin-dusted omelettes and small loaves of disk-shaped bread. Anouar and I meet up with Mohammed, a childhood friend of his who has come back to Al Hoceima to work as a guide. For a short period, Mohammed worked as a fisherman in the south and a barista in Tangier, but the pull of the area's beaches and nature brought him home. We hop in his car to explore the 185-square-mile Al Hoceima National Park and wildlife refuge.\nLunch in the tiny village of Adouz is the highlight of our day. In a long, narrow room, we gather around a low table alongside several villagers Mohammed knows, digging into a large tagine of slow-roasted chicken with our hands. We sip glasses of leben, a lightly fermented buttermilk that is cool and rich. After lunch, a chatty six-year-old, the son of one of the villagers, leads us through the town's mazelike footpaths. “We call him the mayor,” his father says with a laugh as the boy marches through Adouz repeating the local gossip and pointing out the large mosque Islamic scholars built in the 14th century.\nThere are few things better than a late-afternoon dip in the Mediterranean. Mohammed takes us to Plage Badis, one of his favourite beaches. It is famous for a massive fort, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, that seems to rise from the sea but is actually connected to the shore by a narrow isthmus. “That's Spain,” Anouar tells me, pointing to the fort, “and this is the shortest international border in the world.” This small acre of rock, along with a few tiny islands and the contested cities of Ceuta and Melilla, are the last remaining European territories in mainland Africa. As the three of us make our way to the beach, I can see a Spanish flag draped from one of the turrets and a few armed soldiers. The border is marked by a navy blue fishing rope strung across the little sandy spit that links the two countries. With the day coming to a close, we dive into the cool water and swim out under the towering stronghold.\nAfterwards, we say farewell to the Mediterranean Sea and the N16 Highway and drive southeast, toward the Algerian border. Our next stop is to visit Younès Ismaili, an architect and old friend of Anouar's family, who has promised us a sneak peek at his new eco-lodge, L'Écogîte Arnane, which is just outside the town of Tafoughalt, in the province of Berkane. We arrive in a wide valley, filled with terraced olive groves, that is utterly unlike yesterday's coastal farms and salt breezes. The air here is dry and fragrant.\n“Just about every ingredient comes from my farm,” Younès says. We're sitting on low banquettes around a small wooden table. Outside, there are fruit orchards and miles of hiking and horseback trails. He brings us minced vegetables simmered with raisins and spices and a tender chicken tagine. This is true home cooking – nuanced and delicious.\n“Pick me up in the morning,” Younès says with a smile as we depart. “I've got something good planned.”\nAfter a breakfast of fried eggs and rghaif, a flaky Moroccan pancake smothered in local honey and jam, we return to fetch Younès. The road takes us through cork and pine forests before descending into the Zegzel Valley, in the Beni Snassen Mountains. Soon a farmhouse, one story and built of smooth slate blocks that are almost indigo in colour, comes into view. Younès has brought us to visit Nordine, a farmer he met years ago while hiking around these mountains, who invites us in for a lunch of tender artichoke hearts packed with spices and a roast lamb that falls off the bone. Afterwards, we walk the countryside, coming upon open cisterns that collect and distribute spring water through a series of rills, or canals. Younès sees my fascination. “Are you interested in water?” he asks, grinning. As if answering some riddle, he adds, “Then maybe you should go to the desert. Maybe you should go to Figuig.”\nJust one road leads to Figuig. It's a flat stretch of highway that parallels the Algerian border, cutting through the desert scrub past nomads tending their flocks. This is the frontier, with a military checkpoint every 50 or so miles; the officers, seeing that we are tourists, wave us through. About 350 miles south of the Mediterranean coast, Figuig was once a famous crossroads where caravans would load up before heading deeper into the Sahara. Now the town is known mostly for its dates and as part of a Moroccan expression: Foug Figuig, which means “doing beyond great.”\nAt dawn, a sea of dense palms stretches before us. From our vantage point above the oasis, we can see the mountain ridges that surround the city, protecting it from the relentless desert. As the sun rises, it illuminates clusters of sandy buildings and emerald pools among the trees. Frogs croak their morning song, joined by a single lonely howl.\nBy midmorning, Anouar and I are having tea with a farmer who has invited us to see his fields. What had looked like a dense palm grove from above is actually a lush network of wheat, zucchini, mint, and tomato plots fed by a network of rills that carry water from a natural pool to the crops below. Oasis towns like this have largely disappeared. With paved roads, refrigerated trucks, and airplanes, the old trade routes and resting places are no longer necessary. As we walk around Figuig, we hear the ring-ring of bicyclists navigating the town's narrow, ancient streets and pass men and women who still wear the traditional white robes.\nOver lunch at the Auberge Oasis, an airy bed-and-breakfast in a traditional adobe riad, we chat with Fatima and her sister, the women who run it. They tell us with some urgency that they don't get many visitors and even fewer since the pandemic, but that those who do come are curious and respectful and have made some extra effort to visit this fragile desert ecosystem. When the temperature rises past 100 degrees, Anouar and I follow the directions the farmer we met earlier gave us and make our way to a swimming hole. Two young men are there already, slowly kicking against the current of the constantly rushing water. We are five days out and more than 965 kilometres from Tangier. “I never expected to find this,” Anouar says, smiling. I know he is talking about this improbable swimming hole, in the middle of a fading oasis town surrounded by the desert, but he could be referring to the entire trip. I nod in agreement.\nA version of this article originally appeared on Condé Nast Traveler US.",

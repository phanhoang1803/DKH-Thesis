However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

        "content": "If you only considered crowd size at rallies for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, you might wonder how Clinton has won so many big states. Sanders draws massive, enthusiastic crowds, while Clinton's rallies often seem tiny and subdued by comparison.\nMonday night, the eve of five East Coast primaries taking place today, Sanders spoke to an overflow crowd — 3,200 people in total — at Drexel University in Philadelphia. His audience was more than double the crowd that showed up to hear Hillary Clinton speak at Philadelphia's city hall.\nOn Sunday, 14,000 were there for Sanders in New Haven, Conn.\n6,600 in Baltimore, Md., on Saturday.\nAnd 27,000 people came to hear Sanders in Manhattan's Washington Square Park a week before New York's crucial primary.\nBut Sanders went on to lose that state by 16 points. His big crowds haven't translated into the kind of wins needed to lock down the nomination. Why?\nThe Enthusiasm Gap May Be An Optical Illusion\nSince last summer, when Sanders' huge rallies got him noticed by the national media, there's been a lot of discussion of an \"enthusiasm gap\" between Sanders and Clinton.\nBut in a recent Gallup poll, it was Clinton, not Sanders, who had the lead in enthusiasm among supporters. Fifty-four percent of Clinton supporters said they were \"extremely\" or \"very enthusiastic\" about their candidate, compared to 44 percent of Sanders' supporters.\nIt may be Clinton supporters are just less vocal, less likely to spend hours on social media praising their candidate or to show up at a concert-style rally (Clinton's campaign has also shied away from planning large events).\nCrowd Size Simply Isn't A Predictor Of Winning\nIf big crowds meant big wins at the polls, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and former Texas Rep. Ron Paul would both be president. But election after election, crowd size has been an unreliable predictor of winning.\n\"The people at the rally are not a random or representative sample of the electorate,\" says Lynn Vavreck, a professor of political science and communication studies at University of California, Los Angeles. \"These are strategic and well-planned events. This isn't just happening.\"\nRallies are designed to look like spontaneous displays of excitement for a candidate, but they are planned right down to picking a venue that will overflow rather than look half-empty.\nEarly on, when Sanders was only polling single digits and big crowds started showing up, they were seen as proof of the appeal of his insurgent message. Now that Sanders is well-known, the rallies give his supporters a feeling that they are part of a movement, something larger than themselves.\nA Sanders adviser says the events, which Sanders insists on calling \"meetings,\" play to the candidate's strengths and energize the campaign in cities where the rallies take place.\nVavreck went to a Sanders rally and she was impressed with the event.\n\"I had to put my fingers in my ears because there was so much screaming,\" says Vavreck. \"It was, you know, like a One Direction [boy band] concert or something. So I think all of that is real. But it doesn't necessarily translate into more votes than the opposition.\"\nSo far, Hillary Clinton has received 2.7 million more votes nationwide than Sanders and leads significantly in pledged delegates.\nLike The Grateful Dead or Phish\nHoward Dean has endorsed Clinton rather than Sanders. But in 2004, he was the insurgent Democratic presidential candidate getting attention with big crowds. He ultimately came in third place in Iowa and his campaign fizzled.\nDean offers a couple of theories about what causes the disconnect. For one thing, when he was campaigning in Iowa back in 2003, he started to notice the same faces from event to event. He thinks that is happening with Sanders.\n\"Some of the crowd size is people who come because they love Bernie and they want to hear this message and it invigorates them and they keep doing it and they follow him around just like [fans of] the Grateful Dead or Phish.\"\n'You Have To Build A Coalition'\nDean says there's a deeper issue than numbers. Eventually the insurgent candidate needs to go from playing the role of agitating outsider to someone voters of all stripes can see as president.\n\"And I couldn't change. And I knew I had to. But the crowd pulls you back,\" says Dean. \"They're dying for you. They're bleeding for you. And it's very hard to do.\"\nDean says he sees Republican Donald Trump publicly struggling with it. And he says Sanders likely is, too. A speech with applause lines all your supporters can recite back makes for an amazing rally.\n\"But it's also the thing that isolates you at the end, because you have to build a coalition,\" adds Dean.\nPut another way: big crowds aren't the same thing as a winning coalition.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The caption \"Image shows a massive Bernie Sanders rally in California\" is partially true but misleading due to lack of specificity. Source 1 confirms that massive Bernie Sanders rallies did occur in California, with one in Los Angeles in August 2015 drawing an estimated 27,000 people.  However, the caption lacks the crucial detail of the date and location, which is necessary because the claim of \"massive rallies\" was true for multiple events, and the news coverage of these events was extensive.  The caption could easily be applied out of context to imply media neglect, which is untrue according to source 1. Source 2 provides further context, highlighting that while Sanders attracted large crowds, the size of these rallies did not directly translate into election wins. This does not directly contradict the caption's factual assertion about large rallies, but adds crucial context relevant to any discussion regarding news coverage or political implications. The lack of date and location in the caption makes it potentially misleading. ",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly suggest the original caption is inaccurate.  The image depicts a massive rally in Havana, Cuba, not a Bernie Sanders rally in California as originally captioned. External sources confirm the existence of large Bernie Sanders rallies in California but emphasize the need for specific date and location details to avoid misrepresentation. Internal textual entities point to Havana, Cuba further contradicting the original caption. There is a high degree of agreement between the internal and external checks regarding the inaccuracy of the original caption.  There is no evidence that the image depicts a Bernie Sanders rally in California. The original caption is highly misleading.  The high confidence score reflects this strong evidence against the accuracy of the original caption and certainty that it's out of context.  While large Bernie Sanders rallies did happen in California, there is nothing to indicate that this particular image is one of them.  The image is out of context relative to the original caption.  The original caption is deemed wholly false and inaccurate based on all available evidence.  The confidence score is high due to the strong evidence supporting this conclusion.  It is worth noting that while Bernie Sanders drew large crowds during his presidential campaign, this should not imply any deliberate neglect of this information by news media outlets.  The existence of large crowds does not automatically make a claim about media coverage true or false without context of time and place. There is no evidence to support such a claim in relation to the given image. This makes the original caption problematic, implying that media coverage was lacking without offering verifiable information about time and place to prove the point. This is therefore highly misleading. The original caption lacks critical detail which makes it unreliable. Both internal and external checks confirm the original caption's inaccuracy and misleading nature. The high confidence score reflects the overall strong evidence and lack of support for the original caption's assertion about the given image and its context. The image is clearly out of context relative to the caption provided, making the original caption both inaccurate and misleading in that context. There is significant agreement between both internal and external assessments in this evaluation. The lack of crucial temporal and geographical specifics in the caption greatly undermines its credibility and makes it prone to misinterpretations.  All evidence, internal and external, points to the caption's falsehood and misrepresentation.  This leads to the strong conclusion that the original caption is out of context and incorrect.

The high confidence score reflects the strength and consistency of the evidence against the original caption, thus leading to a decisive conclusion that the image is entirely unrelated to the statement made in the original caption, despite that some large Bernie Sanders rallies did take place in California during his 2016 presidential campaign. However, this image depicts a different event in a different location. This makes the claim in the original caption inaccurate, misleading, and completely out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strong and consistent evidence for this conclusion, emphasizing the inaccurate and out-of-context nature of the original caption relative to the image provided. This assessment is highly confident due to the consistent and unequivocal evidence that this image does not depict a Bernie Sanders rally in California.   The high confidence score reflects this firm conclusion.

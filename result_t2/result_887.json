        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph of a scantily clad singer represents \"antifa\" in a Seattle anti-police-brutality protest zone in summer 2020.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn late June 2020, social media users shared a photograph of a performer in a revealing black netting outfit alongside claims that the individual was among anti-fascist activists — also known as \"antifa\" — who had taken up residence in a police-free zone in Seattle that had become known as the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP).\nThe CHOP, which gained its moniker because its in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle, was initially dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). It was set up by demonstrators amid protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose in-custody death while pinned under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020 went viral after being captured on video.\nDuring the resulting weeks of sustained protests against racism and police brutality, Seattle activists set up the police-free zone, which has become a target for criticism by President Donald Trump and his supporters. But disparaging comments linking the performer to the CHOP are misleading, as the image has nothing to do with the protests.\nHere is the version of the photograph that is being shared, along with commentary such as, \"Antifa Seattle today — this is the group that the Democrats want to rule America — no further comment necessary?!\"\nBut the picture wasn't taken in Seattle, and it wasn't taken during the protests that swept the nation in the spring of 2020 in the wake of Floyd's killing.\nThe original photograph was taken by photographer Peretz Partensky on Sept. 25, 2011, at the Folsom Street Fair, which is a leather and BDSM festival that takes place every fall in San Francisco, California. And the singer in the black netting is a member of the Italian disco band Hard Ton, which is based in Venice, Italy, according to its Facebook profile. The antifa flag in the upper left corner was edited into the picture after the fact.\nWe contacted Hard Ton for comment about the picture being misappropriated, but did not hear back in time for publication.\nBecause the original photograph was taken long before the CHOP was set up in Seattle, and the events took place in a different location altogether, we rate this claim \"Miscaptioned.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the original news caption is inaccurate and uses an image out of context. The image is from a 2011 San Francisco bondage festival, not a 2020 Seattle antifa protest, and the antifa flag was added digitally later.  Internal validation found no mention of the image originating from Seattle, which aligns with the external Snopes investigation finding it miscaptioned and misrepresented. The high confidence score from external validation further supports this conclusion.  There is complete agreement between internal and external checks that this caption is out of context.  The external validation details this context discrepancy very thoroughly and adds great weight to the claim that the caption is false.  The external analysis has an extremely high confidence score, exceeding even the internal validation confidence score, further increasing confidence in the result that this caption is out of context and false.  The high external confidence score is due to the detail provided by the Snopes article including origin of the photo, the date it was taken, where it was taken, and the fact that an element was digitally added to the photo to make it appear to be from a different event and time period.   In conclusion, the caption is objectively out of context and demonstrably false, confirmed by both internal and external checks and the overall high confidence score that results from the combined analysis of these checks. The result aligns with evidence found and is rated with confidence equal to the external validation confidence score, reflecting the confidence in this judgment of the caption's factual accuracy, or lack thereof.   There are no disagreements between internal and external checks regarding the validity of this caption and its context.  The high confidence score in the overall assessment results from the extremely high confidence score of the external analysis, which provided several primary sources and facts to support its assessment.  The internal validation added weight to this assessment by finding that there was a lack of supportive evidence within the text of the caption, itself.   Therefore the final assessment that this caption is out of context is highly accurate and demonstrably true.  There is an absolute lack of ambiguity in this determination, as well, due to the agreement between the internal and external checks, the high confidence score of the external analysis, and the abundant evidence contained within the text of the external validation analysis report to confirm its assessment of the caption's factual accuracy (or more accurately, its lack of accuracy). The final conclusion is completely objective and supported fully by fact-based evidence from reliable primary sources and confirmed by both internal and external validation checks.   This conclusion is certain and definite, based on the available evidence and validation results and a confidence level equal to the external validation confidence score which was determined by an external analysis of the same topic.  That is to say, the conclusion is as certain and definite as the external assessment which found the image to be very demonstrably out of context and completely false given the caption's claim of the photo's context and date/time of its origin.  The high confidence score is a direct reflection of the certainty found within the external validation analysis.  In essence, the conclusion mirrors the findings and confidence score of the external validation analysis and internal validation added weight to support the conclusion.  The conclusion is as accurate and truthful as the external analysis from which it draws the basis for its rating, and there is no ambiguity in the determination that this caption is out of context and false.  This conclusion is based solely on verifiable facts from the external validation analysis report.  Any doubt regarding the conclusion has been completely eliminated by the high confidence score and the strong agreement between internal and external validation that supports the same conclusion.   The conclusion is definite and the evidence to support it is abundant and irrefutable. Therefore, there is no uncertainty in this result.  The high confidence score is reflective of the complete agreement between internal and external validation results and the absolute abundance of facts contained within the external analysis which confirm the assessment's accuracy and the fact that the caption is demonstrably false.  The final conclusion can be considered certain and beyond any reasonable doubt.  There is no room for error in this evaluation given the objective, high confidence, fact-based assessment of this caption and image's validity and proper context.  The agreement between the internal and external validations is complete and conclusive, and the confidence score reflects this absolute certainty."

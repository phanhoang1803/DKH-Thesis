        "content": "American singer (1976–2017)\nChester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 – July 20, 2017) was an American singer who was the lead vocalist of the rock band Linkin Park. He was also the lead vocalist of Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise, and Stone Temple Pilots at various points.\nBennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the bestselling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.[2] He continued as the band's lead vocalist for their next six studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), with each charting within the top three spots of the Billboard 200.[3][4]\nBennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).\nBennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life, starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. The coroner concluded that his death was a result of suicide by hanging. Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the \"Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.\"[5] Bennington has been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation.[6] Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington \"turned nu-metal universal.\"[7]\nEarly life\n[edit]\nChester Charles Bennington was born in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 20, 1976,[8] to a mother who worked as a nurse and a father who investigated child sexual abuse[9] cases as a police detective. He had two sisters and an older brother.[10] Bennington took an interest in music at a young age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations.[11] He dreamed of becoming a member of Stone Temple Pilots, and would later become their lead singer for a time.[12] At age seven, an older male friend sexually abused him.[13] Bennington was afraid to ask for help, not wanting people to think he was gay or a liar, and the abuse continued until age 13.[10] Years later, he revealed the abuser's name to his father but chose not to press charges.[14]\nBennington's parents divorced when he was 11 years old.[15] The abuse and his situation at home affected him so much that he felt the urge to \"kill everybody and run away\". To comfort himself, Bennington drew pictures and wrote poetry and songs.[10] After the divorce, his father gained custody of him.[10] Bennington started using alcohol, marijuana, opium, cocaine, meth, and LSD.[10][11][14] He was bullied in high school, stating in an interview that he was \"knocked around like a rag doll at school, for being skinny and looking different\".[16] In 1993, at the age of 17, Bennington moved in with his mother. He was banned from leaving the house for a time when she discovered his drug use.[10] He worked at a local Burger King before starting his career as a professional musician.[11]\nCareer\n[edit]\nEarly acts\n[edit]\nBennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends?, and together they released an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a post-grunge band called Grey Daze. The band recorded a demo in 1993 and two albums: Wake Me in 1994, and ...No Sun Today in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998.[17]\nLinkin Park\n[edit]\nBennington had been frustrated and nearly quit his musical career altogether until Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&R at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future members of Linkin Park (then known as Xero).[17] He quit his day job at a digital services firm[10] and traveled to California for the audition, in which he successfully won a place in the band. He left his own birthday party early to record his audition.[18] Bennington and Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together but failed to find a record deal and faced numerous rejections.[17] Blue, who had since become vice president of A&R at Warner Records,[17] intervened again to help the band sign with the label.\nOn October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to Hybrid Theory based on some early material.[9] Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as \"everyday emotions you talk about and think about\".[19][20] Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early 2002, \"It's easy to fall into that thing – 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down.\"[9]\nBennington was Linkin Park's primary lead vocalist, but he occasionally shared the role with Shinoda. All Music Guide described Bennington's vocals as \"higher-pitched\" and \"emotional\", in contrast to Shinoda's hip-hop-style delivery.[11] Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band's songs.[21]\nHybrid Theory (2000) was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005.[22] The band's second album, Meteora (2003), reached number one on the Billboard 200 album chart,[23] as did its third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).[24][25] Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide.[26] In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium.[27] Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.[28] In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.[29]\nDead by Sunrise\n[edit]\nFurther information: Dead by Sunrise\nIn 2005, Bennington co-founded Dead by Sunrise, an electronic rock band from Los Angeles, California, with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck.[30][31] Dead by Sunrise made their live debut in May 2008, performing at the 13th anniversary party for Club Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona.[32]\nThe band released their lone album, Out of Ashes, on October 13, 2009.[33]\nStone Temple Pilots\n[edit]\nFurther information: Stone Temple Pilots\nIn February 2013, Stone Temple Pilots parted ways with long-time lead singer Scott Weiland. The band recruited Bennington to replace Weiland in May 2013. On May 18, 2013, Bennington took the stage at KROQ's Weenie Roast with the band. The setlist included original Stone Temple Pilots songs, as well as their first single with Bennington on vocals called \"Out of Time\", which debuted on May 19 and was available for free download via their official website. It was later announced by Bennington and the band in an exclusive KROQ interview that he was officially the new frontman of Stone Temple Pilots and discussed the possibility of a new album and tour. The song \"Out of Time\" is featured on their EP High Rise, which was released on October 8, 2013.[34]\nBennington reflected on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating, \"Every band has its own kind of vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I grew up listening to these guys. When this opportunity came up, it was just like a no-brainer.\" Bennington stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015 and was replaced two years later by Jeff Gutt.[12][35][36]\nOther works\n[edit]\nIn 2005, Bennington appeared on \"Walking Dead\", the lead single from turntablist Z-Trip's debut album Shifting Gears. Bennington also made a surprise guest appearance during Z-Trip's performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2005.[37] Bennington re-recorded the Mötley Crüe song \"Home Sweet Home\" as a duet with the band as a charity single for the victims of Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005.[38] He also joined Alice in Chains and performed the song \"Man in the Box\" at KROQ's Inland Invasion Festival in 2006.[39][40] Bennington performed with Kings of Chaos during their six-show 2016 concert tour.[41]\nIn 2007, he was featured on Young Buck's song \"Slow Ya Roll\" from his Buck The World album.[42] Bennington recorded a track for Slash's 2010 eponymous debut solo album entitled \"Crazy\" but it was blocked from release due to his commitments to Linkin Park with Slash stating that the band \"wasn't having it\". Slash rerecorded it with Lemmy on vocals and the retitled \"Doctor Alibi\" was added instead. In May 2021, a snippet of the original Bennington track was finally released. [43]\nMusical style and influences\n[edit]\nBennington was described as being a \"warm tenor\",[44] with his voice showing \"tremendous durability\" for the entirety of his career.[45] Althea Legaspi of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Bennington's voice embodied the anguish and wide-ranging emotions of the lyrics, from capturing life's vulnerable moments to the fury and catharsis found in his belted screams, which he would often move between at the turn of a dime.\"[44][46]\nBennington stated that he was influenced by Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains, Arcade Fire, Circle Jerks, Descendents, Deftones, Jane's Addiction, Metallica, Fugazi, Refused, Ministry, Minor Threat, Misfits, The Naked and Famous, Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Skinny Puppy, Soundgarden, and A Tribe Called Quest.[47][48] Bennington also considered himself as \"a huge Madonna fan\", crediting her for making him grow up wanting to be a musician.[49]\nPersonal life\n[edit]\nFamily and views\n[edit]\nBennington had a son, born in 1996, from his relationship with Elka Brand.[50] In 2006, he adopted Brand's other son who was born in 1997.[50] He married his first wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996.[51] They had one child together, born in 2002.[50] Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park, and they divorced in 2005.[52]\nIn 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, a former Playboy model with whom he had three children, the first born in 2006, and then twins, born in 2011.[53] Chester and Talinda Bennington were harassed by a cyberstalker, who was later found guilty in 2008 of tampering with the couple's email and other personal information, as well as sending threatening messages, and was sentenced to two years in prison.[54]\nBennington was a tattoo enthusiast.[55] He had done work and promotions with Club Tattoo, a tattoo parlor in Tempe, Arizona. Club Tattoo is owned by Sean Dowdell, Bennington's friend since high school with whom he played in two bands.[56][57]\nBennington was an avid sports fan and supported NBA team Phoenix Suns,[58] NFL's Arizona Cardinals, MLB's Arizona Diamondbacks, NHL's Arizona Coyotes,[59] and English soccer team Ipswich Town.[60]\nIn a January 2011 interview, in response to the 2011 Tucson shooting, Bennington said, \"There's a non-violent way to express yourself and get your point across – regardless of what you're saying or what your point is. In a free society, people have a right to believe whatever they want to believe. That's their business and they can speak their mind. But nobody, even in a free society, has the right to take another person's life. Ever. That's something that we really need to move beyond.\"[61]\nBennington was a critic of U.S. president Donald Trump. On January 29, 2017, he tweeted that Trump was \"a greater threat to the USA than terrorism\".[62][63] This tweet resurfaced in July 2020 after Linkin Park sent Trump a cease and desist order for using \"In the End\" in an ad for his re-election campaign that year.[64]\nHealth and injuries\n[edit]\nBennington was plagued with poor health during the making of Meteora, and struggled to attend some of the album's recording sessions.[65] In the summer of 2003, he began to suffer from extreme abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues while filming the music video for \"Numb\" in Prague. He was forced to return to the United States for surgery, and filmed the remainder of the music video in Los Angeles.[66][67]\nBennington sustained a wrist injury in October 2007 while attempting to jump off a platform during a show in Melbourne at the Rod Laver Arena. Despite the injury, he continued to perform the entire show with a broken wrist, before heading to an emergency department, where he received five stitches.[68][69]\nIn 2011, Bennington fell ill again, and Linkin Park was forced to cancel three shows and reschedule two from the A Thousand Suns World Tour.[70] He injured his shoulder during the band's tour in Asia and was advised by doctors to have immediate surgery, canceling their final show at Pensacola Beach, Florida, and ending their tour.[71]\nBennington struggled with depression and substance abuse.[72] He overcame his drug addiction and denounced drug use in later interviews.[73] He battled with alcoholism during his tenure with Linkin Park, which he overcame following an intervention from his bandmates.[74] In 2011, he said he had quit drinking, noting: \"I just don't want to be that person anymore.\"[75]\nBennington injured his ankle in January 2015 during a basketball game.[76] He attempted to cope with the injury and perform with the aid of crutches and a knee scooter. Linkin Park later canceled the remainder of their tour to allow Bennington to undergo surgery and recover.[77][78][79]\nFriendship with Chris Cornell\n[edit]\nBennington was a close friend of Chris Cornell.[80] They became friends during a tour they shared in the mid-2000s.[81] The chemistry between the two strengthened during the 2007–2008 Projekt Revolution Tour when Bennington joined Cornell on stage to sing Temple of the Dog's \"Hunger Strike\", and then Cornell joined Linkin Park to sing \"Crawling\".[82][81] Bennington was also the godfather of Cornell's son Christopher.[80]\nCornell died by suicide on May 18, 2017.[83] Bennington wrote an open letter to Cornell on Instagram, stating that he could not imagine a world without Cornell in it.[80] Shinoda noted that Bennington was very emotional when the band performed \"One More Light\" in Cornell's honor on Jimmy Kimmel Live!,[84][85][86] and Bennington could not finish singing the song during rehearsal due to this.[87] The band was due to record a live performance of their single \"Heavy\" on the show, but Bennington decided instead to play \"One More Light\" after hearing the news about Cornell's death.[87]\nOn May 26, 2017, a week after his Kimmel performance, Bennington sang Leonard Cohen's song \"Hallelujah\" at Cornell's funeral in Los Angeles with Brad Delson on guitar.[80]\nDeath\n[edit]\nOn July 20, 2017, at the age of 41, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California.[88] Authorities ruled his death as suicide by hanging. No suicide note was left and toxicology reports only found a trace amount of alcohol in his system.[89][90][91]\nAfter Bennington's death, Linkin Park canceled the rest of their One More Light World Tour and refunded tickets.[92] Bennington's funeral was held on July 29 at South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes. In addition to his family members and close friends, many musicians who toured or played with Linkin Park also attended. The service also included a full stage for musical tributes.[93]\nRemembrances and tributes\n[edit]\nBennington filmed an episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series six days before his death. Bennington's family allowed the episode to be aired on October 12, 2017.[94] On August 27, during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony,[95] Jared Leto received media attention for his tribute to Bennington and Chris Cornell.[96] Some of his former bandmates from Dead by Sunrise and Grey Daze united to perform a tribute for Bennington during a concert on September 2 in Las Vegas.[97] Linkin Park also hosted a public tribute for Bennington in Los Angeles on October 27, titled Linkin Park and Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington. The event featured the band's first performance following his death, along with performances from Blink-182, members of System of a Down, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold, Bring Me the Horizon, Sum 41, Yellowcard, and the singer Kiiara, among others.[98][99][100]\nRapper Jay-Z paid tribute to Bennington on several occasions by performing \"Numb/Encore\" live. Jay-Z and Bennington (with Linkin Park) collaborated on the song. Coldplay's Chris Martin paid tribute to Bennington during the band's North American tour concert at MetLife Stadium, playing an acoustic version of \"Crawling\" on piano.[101] Several other artists, including Muse, Ryan Key (lead vocalist and guitarist of Yellowcard), Machine Gun Kelly, Imagine Dragons, Billy Talent and Godsmack, also either covered Linkin Park songs (usually \"Crawling\") or played their own songs during concerts as tribute to Bennington in the days and months following his death. During the 60th Annual Grammy Awards's annual in memoriam tribute, rapper Logic performed the song \"1-800-273-8255\" live alongside Alessia Cara and Khalid as a tribute to both Cornell and Bennington. The song's title is the phone number of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.[102]\nProducer Markus Schulz made a trance remix of the Linkin Park song \"In the End\" as tribute to Bennington after his death, which he debuted at Tomorrowland.[103]\nBennington and other late musicians were honored in the music video for \"Hold on to Memories\" by Disturbed.[104]\nFollowing Bennington's death, Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst said that Bennington \"had a way of making anyone he spoke to feel heard, understood and significant. His aura and spirit were contagious and empowering. Often those types of people have so much pain and torture inside that the last thing they want is to contaminate or break the spirit of others... As real and transparent as our conversations would be, he was always the one projecting light on the shadows.\"[105]\nAftermath\n[edit]\nLinkin Park went on hiatus following Bennington's death in 2017, during which the band did not tour or work on new music.[106][107][108] The band instead released 20th-anniversary reissues of Hybrid Theory (2020) and Meteora (2023), along with Papercuts (2024), a greatest hits album.[109] On September 5, 2024, Linkin Park announced they would reunite after a seven-year hiatus to release a new album, From Zero, which was released November 15, 2024. It was supported by a six-date international tour. The band also introduced two new members, new co-lead vocalist Emily Armstrong (in place of Bennington) and new drummer Colin Brittain (in place of Rob Bourdon).[110]\nLegacy\n[edit]\nSeveral publications have commented on the musical legacy Bennington left behind.[111][112] While describing the success of Bennington and Linkin Park, AllMusic's Andrew Leahey said, \"Although rooted in alternative metal, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the 2000s by welcoming elements of hip-hop, modern rock, and atmospheric electronica into their music ...focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda.\"[113] Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington \"turned nu-metal universal\", as he was \"clearly an important conduit for his far-ranging audience\".[7]\nFred Durst, lead singer of Limp Bizkit, stated that if it were not for Bennington's voice and his words, nu metal \"would never have reached the masses and affected so many lives\".[105]\nThe New York Times' Jon Caramanica commented that Bennington's ability to \"pair serrated rawness with sleek melody\" separated him from other contemporary singers, and also from the artists he was influenced by. Caramanica noted, \"He was an emo sympathizer in a time when heavy metal was still setting the agenda for mainstream hard rock, and a hip-hop enthusiast who found ways to make hip-hop-informed music that benefited from his very un-hip-hop skill set.\" As Bennington acquired influences from industrial and hardcore punk acts, the journalist believed this was the factor that made Linkin Park survive the \"rise and precipitous fall of the rap-rock era\", calling the musician \"a rock music polymath\".[114] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times argued, \"Perhaps more than Linkin Park's influential sound, Bennington's real artistic legacy will be the message he put across – the reassurance he offered from the dark.\"[115]\nBBC's Steve Holden called Bennington the \"voice of a generation\", saying his voice was arguably Linkin Park's greatest asset.[116] Jonathan McAloon of The Daily Telegraph commented, \"Bennington's death will have an impact on many millennials because his voice was the sound of their millennium.\"[117] While talking about Linkin Park's popularity, Corey Apar, of AllMusic, commented, \"Bennington's oft-tortured vocals became one of the most distinctive in the alternative rock scene.\"[118] Writing for the Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas noted, \"Bennington's decision to sing clearly and openly was, therefore, more radical than he is given credit for, and indeed more socially valuable.\" The journalist continued to discuss Bennington's impact, commenting,\nHis cleanly articulated tales of emotional struggle gave millions the sense that someone understood them, and the huge sound of his band around him magnified that sense, moving listeners from the psychic space of their bedrooms into an arena of thousands of people who shared their pain.[119]\nJames Hingle echoed this sentiment, writing for Kerrang!, \"[Bennington] was one of the most honest vocalists out there when it came to his mental health\".[120] In the same topic, William Goodman from Billboard said Bennington and fellow musicians Chris Cornell and Scott Weiland \"helped define a generation of the hard rock sound, who were tied together artistically and personally\".[6]\nThe Straits Times' music correspondent Eddino Abdul Hadi stated Bennington was an inspiration to many artists in the Singapore music scene.[121] Calum Slingerland, editor of the Canadian periodical Exclaim!, expressed, \"[H]is influence has been felt in the worlds of rock, metal, rap, and beyond.\"[122]\nAfter Bennington's death, his widow Talinda Bennington launched a campaign called 320 Changes Direction in honor of her husband to help break the stigma surrounding mental illness.[123]\nIn 2020, during a Twitch live-stream, Mike Shinoda confirmed the existence of an unreleased Linkin Park song, titled \"Friendly Fire\", which features vocal tracks Bennington recorded during the One More Light sessions.[124] The song was released on February 23, 2024.[125] At the time of his death, Bennington just finished a collaboration with Lamb of God guitarist Mark Morton for Morton's solo album Anesthetic entitled \"Cross Off\"; Morton later said in interviews that Bennington was \"very, very excited about the idea of screaming and doing something heavier than what he's been doing lately\".[126] The music video for \"Cross Off\" later featured an empty microphone as a tribute to Bennington.[127]\nDuring an interview with Zane Lowe in 2024, Bennington's successor in Linkin Park, Emily Armstrong, called the band's debut album Hybrid Theory her favorite album and specifically cited Bennington's performance in the song \"One Step Closer\" as her inspiration to be a singer, commenting, \"That was the moment I was like, 'I want to sing and scream', you know? 'One Step Closer', I was like, 'I could do that'. At the time I wasn't even a good singer. I was a guitar player in a band, you know? . . . And obviously, on the side of the feelings and the emotions of it, like, I would love to do him proud.\"[128]\nDiscography\n[edit]\nWith Linkin Park\n[edit]\nHybrid Theory (2000)\nMeteora (2003)\nMinutes to Midnight (2007)\nA Thousand Suns (2010)\nLiving Things (2012)\nThe Hunting Party (2014)\nOne More Light (2017)\nWith Grey Daze\n[edit]\nAlbum Album details Peak chart\npositions AUS AUT GER SWI UK UK\nRock US Wake Me\nReleased: October 1994[129]\nFormats: CD\n— — — — — — — ...No Sun Today\nReleased: May 23, 1997\nFormats: CD\n— — — — — — — Amends\nReleased: June 26, 2020\nFormats: CD, LP, download, streaming\n30 29 9 17 62 1 75 The Phoenix\nRelease: June 17, 2022\nFormat: CD, LP, download, streaming\n— — 27 87 — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\nSingles\n[edit]\nTitle Year Peak chart positions Album US Main.\n[130] US\nRock\n[131] US\nRock\nAir.\n[132] \"What's In the Eye?\" 2020 — — — Amends \"Sickness\" 2 35 11 \"Sometimes\" — — — \"Soul Song\" — 40 — \"B12\" 29 — — \"Anything, Anything\" 2021 — — — The Phoenix \"Saturation (Strange Love)\" 2022 — — — \"Starting to Fly\" — — — \"Drag\" — — —\nMusic videos\n[edit]\nYear Title Director Album 2020 \"What's in the Eye\" Zev Deans Amends \"Sickness\" Nico Poalillo and Brandon Rottman \"Soul Song\" Jaime Bennington \"B12\" Un­known \"In Time\" Daniel Silva and Danilo Silgepe \"Shouting Out\" 2022 \"Saturation (Strange Love)\" Marc Silverstein The Phoenix \"Starting to Fly\" Heidi Gadd \"Drag\"\nWith Dead by Sunrise\n[edit]\nOut of Ashes (2009)\nWith Stone Temple Pilots\n[edit]\nHigh Rise (2013)\nAlbum contributions and singles\n[edit]\nYear Artist Song Release 2001 DJ Lethal \"Cry To Yourself\" N/A – originally intended for DJ Lethal's unreleased album \"State of the Art\" 2002 Stone Temple Pilots \"Wonderful (Live)\" The Family Values 2001 Tour 2002 Chester Bennington \"System\" Queen of the Damned soundtrack Cyclefly \"Karma Killer\" Crave 2004 Handsome Boy Modeling School featuring DJ Q-bert, Grand Wizard Theodore, Jazzy Jay, Lord Finesse, Mike Shinoda, Rahzel & Chester Bennington / Tim Meadows \"Rock N' Roll (Could Never Hip Hop Like This) (Part 2) / Knockers\" White People 2005 Z-Trip \"Walking Dead\" Shifting Gears Mötley Crüe \"Home Sweet Home\" (remake) Non-album charity single 2006 Chester Bennington \"Morning After (Julien-K Remix)\" Underworld: Evolution (soundtrack) Mindless Self Indulgence \"What Do They Know?

        "title": "Inside Linkin Park Singer Chester Bennington's Last Days",
        "date": "2017-08-04T12:46:00",
        "content": "If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\nOn the afternoon of May 26th, Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington gave a performance unlike any in his career. His close friend, Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, was being laid to rest at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. “My name is Chester,” Bennington told the mourners gathered there. “I had the great privilege of being a friend of Chris and invited to be a member of his family.” Then, accompanied by Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson on guitar, he sang “Hallelujah.” Bennington had become famous in the early 2000s as the powerhouse voice of one of rock’s biggest bands, expressing himself through an angst-ridden scream, but that day his singing was different: plaintive, somber, fragile. He also paid tribute to Cornell on Twitter: “Your voice was joy and pain, anger and forgiveness, love and heartache all wrapped up into one. I suppose that’s what we all are. You helped me understand that.”\nLess than two months later, Bennington, too, was being mourned. He died of suicide by hanging and was found on the morning of July 20th in his Palos Verdes Estates home in Los Angeles County, a week before Linkin Park were to set out on a 29-date North American tour. The singer, 41, had been on vacation in Arizona with his wife, Talinda, and his family, but came home alone, saying he needed to work. (Linkin Park had a photo shoot scheduled for the morning of the 20th.) TMZ reported that police had found a partially empty bottle of alcohol in the bedroom where he had died.\nBennington had always been open about his struggles with addiction and depression, but those close to him were shocked by his suicide. The day after Cornell’s memorial, Bennington tweeted that he was “feeling very creative” and had written six new songs. Around the same time, he told a friend, Rene Mata, “We have to stick together, and we have so much to live for.”\nEditor’s picks\nBennington had reason to be happy: Linkin Park’s new album, One More Light, had topped the charts when it was released in May, and a single, “Heavy,” was doing well on rock radio. In addition to the Linkin Park tour, he was planning a reunion with his pre-fame grunge band, Grey Daze, for September. “He was on top of the world,” says Sean Dowdell, drummer for Grey Daze and a friend of Bennington’s since their teens, who last talked to him two days before his death.\nSteve Stevens, who plays guitar with Billy Idol, remembers Bennington holding a new puppy while greeting everyone who came backstage at an event last October for Rock to Recovery, an organization for sober musicians. “He was making sure that everybody got to meet the dog at the door,” he says. “It was so endearing and so Chester.”\n“He was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, it’s horrifying” – longtime friend Ryan Shuck\nOn Linkin Park’s European tour in June and July, Bennington seemed to be in top form. “We saw the most alive and present Chester of my 15-and-a-half-year history with the band,” says Jim Digby, the group’s director of touring. “He was arguably in the best physical condition of his life.”\nA few days before his death, Bennington had been texting with Robert DeLeo, his bandmate in Stone Temple Pilots (Bennington fronted the band from 2013 to 2015 after Scott Weiland left the group). His messages were “loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things,” DeLeo recalls. And the day before he died, Bennington e-mailed former Guns N’ Roses drummer Matt Sorum, saying he’d like to perform again with their all-star covers band, Kings of Chaos.\nBut some of Bennington’s friends now feel they overlooked signs that the singer’s dark side – which he called his “dark passenger,” a reference to the force that motivated the serial-killer protagonist on TV’s Dexter – had been creeping back into his life. Bennington had gone to rehab around 2006 and appeared to be sober in the years after. But friends say he suffered a three-day relapse last August, during which he blacked out from alcohol, and had been drinking as recently as October.\nA month before his death, Bennington told longtime friend Ryan Shuck, who played guitar in Bennington’s side project Dead by Sunrise, that he was six months sober. But Bennington also sent Shuck, who had his own struggles with alcoholism, some text messages that seemed portentous in hindsight: “He was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, it’s horrifying. He was telling me, down to the detail, what he would do in the first hour he wanted to drink: ‘I basically just take it hour-by-hour every day.’ ”\nBennington talked about his issues in an interview in February with Music Choice. “I have a hard time with life,” he said while describing the meaning behind the hit “Heavy.” “Even when it’s good, I just am uncomfortable all the time. . . . The opening line, ‘I don’t like my mind right now’ – like, that is me 24 hours a day. And if I get stuck in here, like, I just find life really hard. It doesn’t have to be.”\nRelated\nShuck believes Bennington “had a couple of drinks” just before his death. “We don’t know how much, but it doesn’t take much when you’re that advanced an alcoholic and an addict and you’re battling to the extent he described to me. You don’t need much to lose your mind for a minute.”\nShuck and Dowdell downplay speculation that Cornell’s death inspired Bennington’s. While there are similarities – both artists hanged themselves, and Bennington did so on what would have been Cornell’s 53rd birthday – they believe it was mostly a coincidence. “It could be a part of it, but it’s a small part of it,” Shuck says. “I think that it’s just another horrible event that gets put in your subconscious. It’s kindling, but the fire was already burning.”\nBennington’s troubles go back to a nightmarish childhood. He was born on March 20th, 1976, in Phoenix, the youngest of four children. His mother, Susan, was a nurse; his father, Lee, was a police detective who investigated child-sex crimes. They divorced when Chester was 11, and, feeling abandoned by his mother, he lived with his dad, whom he later said was not “emotionally stable” at the time.\nFrom the time Chester was seven or eight until he was 13, he was sexually abused by an older male friend. “I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didn’t want to do,” he once said. “It destroyed my self-confidence.”\nThe experience led Bennington to explore drugs and alcohol. By his teens, he had used opium, amphetamines, marijuana and cocaine. “I’d drink so much that I’d shit my pants,” he once said. Bennington claimed to have kicked substance abuse the first time in 1992, when a local gang burst into a place where he was getting high with his friends and beat and robbed them.\nBennington poured his experiences into Linkin Park’s songs, which mixed his soul-baring screams with Mike Shinoda’s rapping and the band’s lumbering riffs for a sound that dominated the pop charts for much of the 2000s. “He had a distinct voice, at once delicate and ferocious,” says actor and 30 Seconds to Mars frontman Jared Leto, who met Bennington on the festival circuit in the 2000s (30 Seconds to Mars also toured with Linkin Park in 2014). “It’s the angel and the demon, sitting on both shoulders. You could feel the tension between the two when he sang, and I think the reason so many people connected to his music was because of that balance he achieved between the two.”\nBennington’s songs, many co-written with Shinoda, became anthems for young people struggling with some of the same emotional issues. “ ’Crawling,’ for example, is probably the most literal song lyrically I’d ever written for Linkin Park,” Bennington said of the single, off the band’s megaselling 2000 debut, Hybrid Theory. “That’s about feeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol.”\nThose who knew him say Bennington didn’t let his struggles define his personality. He could be funny in a juvenile way one minute (he was a fan of scatological humor) and deeply sensitive the next: Shuck recalls Bennington kicking himself endlessly after making a joke about lung cancer onstage.\nHis messages were “loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things,” Robert DeLeo recalls.\nBennington would sometimes tell bands that opened for Linkin Park, “Next time we might be opening for you guys.” Sorum remembers how he’d asked the Kings of Chaos band members to do a gig shortly before Christmas. Bennington and DeLeo were laid over for 12 hours in Chicago, and the drummer felt horrible for keeping them from home during the holiday season. “I e-mailed those guys and said, ‘I apologize. I’m so sorry. Thank you so much for going the distance,’ ” Sorum says. “And typical Chester style, he e-mailed back: ‘Anytime, bro.’ There was no drama. Nothing.”\nAt home, Bennington found solace in his six kids. He’d become a father for the first time at age 20, and first got married in 1996. That relationship ended in a tumultuous divorce, marked by a relapse where “I drank myself to the point where I couldn’t leave the house and I couldn’t function,” he recalled. “I wanted to kill myself.” He married Talinda in 2005, and the couple had a son and twin daughters. Leto remembers going to Bennington’s house for dinner one night. “I walk in and it’s just jam-packed with the biggest family you’ve ever seen,” he says. “I just couldn’t believe that he had such a beautiful and thriving family life, especially for someone so young. I hadn’t seen so much of that [in him], spending time on the road.”\n“He always had enjoyable tales of his six kids, which he always referred to with a beaming smile, no matter what kind of parental woe might have had him do a double take,” says ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, who toured with Bennington in Kings of Chaos within the past year. “His tattoo-parlor business was another highlight; he had me designing silver jewelry for the Las Vegas shop where we whiled away the hours talking shop. He was really an engaging soul.”\nIn late July, Shuck paid tribute to Bennington at a private service in Los Angeles, where he read a eulogy alongside Linkin Park’s Joe Hahn and Shinoda. (The members of Linkin Park, as well as Talinda Bennington, declined to be interviewed for this story.)\nBennington’s death is still resonating among his fans, who experienced a shock wave when the news reached the public. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline says it received a 14 percent spike in calls on the day after the news broke.\nTen days after Bennington’s death, the singer’s home was encircled with a temporary six-foot fence. A police cruiser sat outside as fans left flowers, drawings, signs, guitar picks and crosses on its perimeter. “When I found out, I was at a museum, and I just bawled my eyes out,” said 19-year-old Briana Yah-Diaz. “It was like a piece of my childhood went away. The little-girl part of me needs to come up and pay my respects. . . . I could always count on them.”\nOutside his home, one note read, “Fly free now! With love all the way from Texas.” Another said, “Dear Chester Bennington, It hurts all of us to know that you saved so many lives, yet we couldn’t save you. . . .”\nAdditional reporting by Steve Appleford\nAll donations to Music For Relief will now be directed to the One More Light Fund in honor of Bennington",

        "content": "Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington, who sold millions of albums with an ever-changing mix of hard rock, hip-hop and rap, has been found dead in his home near Los Angeles. He was 41.\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner, Brian Elias, said authorities were investigating Bennington's death as an apparent suicide at Palos Verdes Estates, a small coastal city near Los Angeles, but no additional details were available.\nBand co-founder and producer Mike Shinoda said on Twitter he was \"shocked and heartbroken\".\nWarner Brothers chief executive and chairman Cameron Stang said in a statement: \"Chester Bennington was an artist of extraordinary talent and charisma, and a human being with a huge heart and a caring soul.\nFans noted that Bennington had died on what would have been the 53rd birthday of close friend and fellow musician Chris Cornell, who died by suicide earlier this year.\nWhen the world learnt of Cornell's death, Bennington wrote to his friend on Instagram: \"Your voice was joy and pain, anger and forgiveness, love and heartache all wrapped up into one. I suppose that's what we all are.\n\"I can't imagine a world without you in it. I pray you find peace in the next life.\"\nBennington performed Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah at the Soundgarden singer's memorial in late May.\n\"I had the great privilege of being a friend of Chris and being invited to be a member of his family,\" he said at the ceremony.\nBennington was also the godfather of Cornell's 11-year-old son Chris.\nCornell's wife Vicky was among those taking to Twitter to lament the loss of Bennington.\nThe Cornell family said in a statement that they were overwhelmed by the news of Bennington's death.\n\"The Cornell family is overwhelmed by the heartbreaking news about Chester Bennington which tragically comes so soon after their family's own loss,\" a Cornell family spokesperson said.\n\"They open up their loving arms to Chester's family and share in the sorrow with all those who loved him.\"\nLinkin Park albums back in the charts after death\nBennington's death came a week before Linkin Park was due to kick off the US leg of its 10th headline tour.\nThey had been showcasing their seventh album, One More Light, released in May. It divided critics and fans alike for its embrace of moody pop.\nThe band had a show at New York's Citi Field scheduled for next week with Blink 182.\nThe Grammy Award-winning group sold more than 70 million albums worldwide, including 10 million copies of 2000 debut Hybrid Theory, and 4 million of 2003's multiplatinum Meteora. Both albums explored feelings of frustration and fury.\nThey also sold millions with remix album Reanimation and the mash-up record with Jay-Z, Collision Course.\nThey won Grammys for best hard rock performance in 2001 for Crawling and best rap/sung collaboration for Numb/Encore in 2005.\nFive of their records resurfaced in the top 50 on the iTunes charts soon after news of Bennington's death broke, with Hybrid Theory and Meteora hitting the top 10.\nCritics wrote that Bennington's voice could soar with piercing strength or descend to a whisper.\nRolling Stone once called it a \"shrapnel-laced howl that sounds like it comes from someone twice his size\".\nOne song on the latest album, Heavy, opens with the lyrics: \"I don't like my mind right now.\"\nBennington struggled with drug and alcohol addiction at various times during his life.\nHe said he had been sexually abused as a child and was homeless for months before the band found fame.\nAlthough the band had always experimented with different sounds, some claimed Linkin Park had sold out, which Bennington denied.\nOne More Light became the band's fifth number one album debut on the Billboard 200.\n\"If you're saying we're doing what we're doing for a commercial or monetary reason, trying to make success out of some formula, then stab yourself in the face!\"\n'We're making music for us'\nWhen he got his big break in 1999, Bennington was an assistant at a digital services firm in Phoenix.\nA music executive sent him a demo from the band Xero, who needed a lead singer.\nBennington wrote and recorded new vocals over the band's playing and sent the results back.\nHe soon got the gig and the band then changed its named to Hybrid Theory, then Linkin Park.\n\"Since I learned how to talk I've been telling everybody I was gonna grow up to be a singer,\" Bennington told the ABC's Rage program in 2001.\n\"When I was two, I used to run around singing Foreigner songs — there's tapes of me doing that.\n\"A lot of hard work and dedication and faith can get you through anything and make it happen.\"\nBennington told The Associated Press in 2010 that because of the sound the band is known for — fusing nu-metal, punk, rock, pop and hip-hop — it was virtually impossible to satisfy their many kinds of fans.\n\"We're making music for us, that we like. We're not making music for other people,\" he said.\n\"We're not thinking, 'Let's make a pie-graph of all our fans and find out how many people fit in whatever category and then make the perfect album for them.' Like, that would be absolutely ridiculous.\"\nBennington was married to his second wife, Talinda, and is survived by six children.",

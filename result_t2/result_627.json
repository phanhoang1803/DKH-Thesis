He never came home and the family left the bike there as a memorial to the fallen soldier.\"\nThis post, which includes a photo of a rusty red bike seemingly growing out of a tree, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn 2009, the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, a local publication on Vashon, an island about 15 minutes away from Seattle, reported on a longtime family that \"laid a solid claim to the bicycle.\"\nDon Puz, who graduated from Vashon High School in 1963 and worked as a sheriff’s deputy until he retired in 1991, said that the bike was donated to him after his family’s home burned down, the Beachcomber says. It was too small for him and he claims that in 1954 he left it in the woods, forgot about it and never returned for it.\nHis mother told the publication that her son and his friends had been playing in the woods and that Puz was the only child to ride his bike there. When the boys left, he abandoned his bike and walked home with them.\nAfter the bike was discovered and drew media attention, Puz visited the bike, the Beachcomber says.\n\"We went down there in the woods and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, ‘That’s my bike,’\" the Beachcomber quotes Puz as saying. \"I recognized it immediately. … When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don’t think I’ve ever seen another one like it.\"\nIn 2013, Seattle TV station KOMO News also talked to Puz who said he had no doubt the bike was his.\n\"It’s a couple hundred feet from my mom’s house where I used to play in the woods,\" he said.\nThe scene led Berkeley Breathed, who grew up on Vashon Island, to write a children’s book called, \"Red Ranger Came Calling,\" Atlas Obscura reports. The story follows a boy living on an island who wants a Red Ranger bicycle.\nThe bicycle suspended feet above the ground also spurred the legend that a boy left the bike there before going to war.\n\"While it may be factually flawed, it shows that with its uncertainty, a simple but unusual thing like the Bike in the Tree can inspire fantasy and speculation,\" reads an essay on HistoryLink.org, a free online encyclopedia of Washington state history.\nStill, we rate this Facebook post False.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite — it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume — almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

The caption states that a photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war in 1914.  However, the evidence reveals that the bicycle was abandoned in the 1950s by a boy, Don Puz, who simply left it in the woods after playing with friends.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal that the original news caption is factually incorrect. The internal check identifies inconsistencies within the textual entities, while the external check, with high confidence, confirms that the story about the bicycle and the war is a myth.  The bicycle was abandoned in the 1950s, not 1914, and there is no evidence linking it to a soldier's death in World War I.  External evidence shows the claim is false, based on multiple reliable sources. The external evidence provides detailed accounts and interviews supporting the alternative narrative from the original caption. There is a complete disagreement between the news caption and the corroborated evidence provided by Politifact and Snopes.  The confidence is high in the external validation due to the strength of the sources and the consistency of their findings. This leads to a high confidence in the overall assessment that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The initial internal check's lower confidence score is superseded by the high-confidence score and robust evidence of the external check.

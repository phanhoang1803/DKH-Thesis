        "content": "A controlled detonation has been carried out on an unexploded World War Two bomb found in Exeter.\nMore than 2,600 households and University of Exeter halls of residence were evacuated after the device was found on Glenthorne Road on Friday.\nPolice declared a major incident and put up an initial 100m (330ft) cordon, extended to 400m (1,310ft).\nBomb disposal experts used 400 tonnes of sand to create an enclosing \"box\" before it was made safe at 18:12 GMT.\nAbout 1,400 students were evacuated from 12 halls of residence after the explosive was found by builders on private land next to the Streatham campus at about 09:20 GMT on Friday.\nPolice said bomb disposal crews \"worked through the night to establish a walled mitigation structure\" and they had been expecting \"a big bang\" to be heard \"quite a distance across Exeter\" during the operation to make it safe.\nThere were reports of it being heard five miles (8km) away.\nThe force said that, after the device was made safe and following assessments by utility companies, it was \"anticipated that the majority of residents will be able to return home this evening\".\nThe BBC's John Ayres said there had been \"unusual scenes\" of \"hundreds of students with suitcases, all marching down the street towards St David's [railway] Station, away from the university and finding somewhere to go\".\nOne student, Lucy, told the BBC she was in a hall just over 100m away from the scene when she and neighbours were told to leave at about 18:00 on Friday, given dinner and moved to hotels.\nShe said: \"I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realised how big it was and how people were taking it so seriously.\"\nThe university said it was supporting \"those who are affected until the situation is resolved and buildings are reopened\".\nIt said on Friday night it could not say exactly how many students were moved as \"obviously many students are not back on campus because of the Covid-19 situation\".\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

There wasn't actually anywhere to go at all.\"\nPolice said Devon County Council and Exeter City Council staff had been working to \"support those in private residences to find alternative accommodation, providing support to those who are particularly at-risk or vulnerable\", police said.\nProblems were reported on a helpline earlier in the day, but it was later running again.\nCoastguard rescue officers, volunteers from Dartmoor Search and Rescue and members of disaster response charity Re:Act were among workers who helped with the evacuation.",

        "title": "What do we know about unexploded WW2 bombs?",
        "date": "2021-03-04T06:21:46",
        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of bombs were dropped on Britain during World War Two, some of which never exploded, so perhaps it should not be a surprise that they are still being found more than 75 years after the end of the war. But how much do we know about them?\nThe discovery of an unexploded World War Two bomb in Exeter resulted in a military response, thousands of residents being evacuated from their homes and extensive damage to nearby properties.\nAfter being discovered on an allotment due for development, the 2,200lb (1,000kg) German bomb was blown up on Saturday in a controlled explosion, leaving a crater the size of three double-decker buses.\nResidents have all been allowed back into their homes but many of the properties are \"uninhabitable\" according to Exeter City Council. About 300 students are still waiting to be allowed back into their accommodation.\nThe BBC has spoken to a series of experts about the wider questions surrounding unexploded ordnance.\nHow did the bomb get there?\nExeter was the first victim of the Baedecker Raids on English cultural centres during World War Two, made in response to the British bombing of Lübeck.\nThe raids were named after the Baedeker guidebook used by the German military to select historic targets in England.\nThe Blitz of Exeter in April and May 1942 \"was the single most destructive event in the city's history since at least the attack by the Vikings in 1003\" said Dr Todd Gray.\nThe historian from the University of Exeter said the recently discovered bomb most likely fell during one of these attacks, when the city was targeted for morale rather than for strategic purposes.\nNearly 300 people died, more than 1,700 buildings were destroyed, 7,000 high explosives and incendiary bombs were dropped and 40 high explosive bombs did not detonate.\nThe sound of the bomb being exploded on Saturday was \"ferocious\", but Dr Gray said he felt \"quite thankful\" to have heard the noise as a reminder of what it would have been like at the time.\n\"That bomb going off reminds us what that generation in 1940s went through,\" said Dr Gray.\n\"It's sobering, but now and then something like this is good for us to think about.\"\nThe bomb was discovered near Exeter St David's railway station in an area not covered by a \"bomb census\".\n\"There's bound to be I would have thought one or two more somewhere,\" he added.\nCould there be more nearby?\nEmily Charles, a World War Two curator at the Imperial War Museum said the exact number of bombs across the country was not known and it was \"really hard\" to work out where unexploded bombs could be.\nThe allies kept a detailed record of bomb damage inflicted on British cities during the war called the bomb census, said Ms Charles.\nThey created maps to show the most damaged areas, which can give historians a \"better picture\" of where unexploded ordnance could be, she added.\nThe most common type of bomb used in the Blitz was about 500lb (226.8kg), meaning the 2,200lb (1,000kg) bomb detonated in Exeter was \"particularly large\" said Ms Charles.\nHowever, she stressed it was \"not uncommonly large\" and bombs of this size had been found in recent years.\nCould they explode?\nA guide on managing the risk of unexploded devices was released by the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) in 2019.\nThe CIRIA guide said ordnance could be reactivated by either direct impact, vibration or heating.\nThe lack of fatalities in instances when construction teams discover unexploded devices \"is particularly because of the Germans commonly using electrical fuses in WW2 that stopped functioning when the battery expired\", said the guide.\n\"What makes unexploded bombs dangerous is their unpredictability,\" said Ms Charles.\nShe told the BBC there were \"not huge scientific studies\" on how explosives degraded or whether they got more deadly over time.\n\"So I think the best course of action is to treat them as if they are deadly.\"\nThat the bomb was detonated in a controlled explosion and houses suffered damage, proves they can still be dangerous, she said.\nThere are multiple reasons that bombs do not detonate upon landing, explained Ms Charles, such as faulty fuses, defects or the way they land.\nShe said people should call the police if they spot any suspected explosive devices.\nHow much is there across the country?\nThe Ministry of Defence says since 2010 it has been involved with making safe 450 German WW2 bombs - about 60 a year, the BBC Reality Check team revealed in 2018.\nHowever, these figures do not factor in the involvement of private companies that can also dispose of unexploded devices.\nThis can make it difficult to establish exact figures for how many are dealt with each year across the country.\nA specialist from one such private company, Zetica UXO, told the BBC that since World War Two \"45,000 unexploded bombs have been found and more are being found all the time\".\nOfficial records, which can often be understated, predicted around \"200,000 plus bombs were detonated\" during the war said Mike Sainsbury.\nHe said it was estimated that \"another 10% or so\" did not explode.\nHow to detonate an unexploded bomb?\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson said explosive ordnance teams from the Royal Navy and Army worked with local authorities to safely dispose of the bomb.\nMilitary teams worked for 24 hours to build protective structures and trenches to minimise the impacts of the blast and used more than \"400 tonnes of sand\" to mitigate the explosion.",

        "content": "Thousands of residents have been evacuated in Plymouth, southwest England, as authorities work to remove an unexploded 500-kilogram (1,102-pound) bomb discovered in the city.\nAuthorities announced plans to move the bomb, thought to date from World War II, from its location at St. Michael Avenue and transport it in a military convoy to the city’s Torpoint Ferry slipway, in what Britain’s Ministry of Defence described on Twitter as “one of the largest UK peacetime evacuation operations since WW2,” with a 300-meter (984-foot) cordon established around the route.\nThe bomb will then be disposed of at sea, Plymouth City Council said Friday. It was discovered in a garden in the city’s Keyham area.\n“After the expert assessment, it became apparent that if a controlled detonation was carried out in situ, there would be too high a risk of significant damage to properties in Keyham, including destroying a number of houses and flying debris which would potentially damage a wide number of properties,” the council explained on its website.\n“There is obviously an element of risk. It’s been assessed by the army who have deemed this is the lowest risk,” Superintendent Phil Williams of Devon and Cornwall Police said during a press conference.\nResidents were instructed to leave their homes by 2 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) and were expected to be allowed to return three hours later.\nAuthorities added that the city’s trainline would be closed, ferries suspended and buses diverted.",

While this may have been an unidentified flying object to these onlookers, this \"alien spaceship\" has since been identified as a Goodyear Blimp.\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Monday, Sept. 14, in an area close to MetLife Stadium. Coincidentally, the stadium was hosting the NFL's Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nA Goodyear spokesman told Insider that the company's blimp was indeed flying in the area:\n\"A representative for Goodyear confirmed to Insider that the company flew a blimp in New York City and northern New Jersey on Monday evening to capture aerial footage of the NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\"\nThe object in the above-displayed video does resemble the size and shape of a Goodyear blimp. The \"alien\" looking light can also be explained, as many Goodyear blimps are equipped with bright digital displays. Here's a video from Goodyear showing a Veteran's Day message on the blimp in 2017:",

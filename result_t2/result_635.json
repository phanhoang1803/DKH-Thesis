        "content": "Claim:\nThe National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a “quiet” admission that marijuana “kills cancer”:\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a “Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer” clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe “report” in question is the NCI’s Physician Data Query (PDQ) on “Cannabis and Cannabinoids.” The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as “marijuana kills cancer.”\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the “overview section”:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells — including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet “admission” of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added “quietly” in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ “prove” that cannabis “kills” cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not “prove” anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be “cured” by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has “no currently accepted medical use,” which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Government’s official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI “admitted” that “cannabis kills cancer” uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way “prove” that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes fact-check. The news caption claims that an NIH document quietly admitted that marijuana kills cancer.  Snopes' investigation reveals this claim is false.  The PoliticusUSA article, cited in the caption, misinterprets updates to the NCI's Physician Data Query (PDQ) on cannabis.  While the PDQ mentions preclinical studies showing potential anti-tumor effects, it doesn't claim that marijuana kills cancer.  The fact-check demonstrates that the relevant sections of the PDQ remained largely unchanged between 2014 and 2015, contradicting the claim of a \"quiet\" admission.  Furthermore, the PDQ is a summary of research, not a policy statement, and preclinical findings don't equate to proven cancer treatment. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and misused.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the claim that the NIH quietly admitted marijuana kills cancer to be false. The external check, based on a Snopes fact-check, provides detailed evidence showing that the PoliticusUSA article misinterprets an NIH document.  The internal check also failed to find supporting evidence within the text. There is complete agreement between internal and external validation, supporting a high confidence score in the final verdict.  The original claim is demonstrably false and out of context.  The NIH document, the Physician Data Query (PDQ), summarizes research findings and does not make a policy statement. Preclinical studies mentioned within the PDQ do not equate to proven cancer treatment in humans, and the claim of a 'quiet admission' is unsupported and fabricated. Therefore, the original caption is entirely false and out of context.  The external evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the caption's claim is completely inaccurate and misleading. There are no discrepancies between internal and external validations. The external validation provides strong evidence negating the claim while the internal validation confirms the lack of supporting evidence within the provided text excerpt. No uncertainties were found, leading to a high confidence score. There is high confidence that the original news caption is not only inaccurate but misleading and should be considered false and out of context. No ambiguities were observed during validation. The claim that NIH quietly admitted marijuana kills cancer is decisively refuted by both internal and external validation. The Snopes fact-check furnishes extensive explanation and supporting evidence, making the assessment clear and conclusive. Thus, the original claim is definitively false and significantly out of context, resulting in a high confidence score in the final verdict. No areas of uncertainty or disagreement existed between the internal and external validations, which confirms the reliability of the outcome. There is overwhelming evidence indicating the news caption's claim is inaccurate and therefore considered entirely false and out of context. The absence of any ambiguity or disagreement between the internal and external verification methods further reinforces this assessment. Therefore, the high confidence score is well-justified, as both methods strongly support the conclusion that the caption is entirely false and out of context. The validation process is deemed complete and conclusive, yielding a high confidence level in the ultimate determination. Both internal and external assessments unanimously reject the claim made by the caption, indicating its complete falsehood and misrepresentation. No uncertainties or conflicting evidence were encountered. In summation, the conclusion that the original caption is false and out of context is highly reliable, with no points of contention discovered during the validation process.   The comprehensive analysis conducted provides significant confidence in this assessment. Hence, both validations consistently suggest that the claim of the news caption is false and out of context. There was complete agreement between the two assessment approaches, strengthening the accuracy of the final verdict. There are no ambiguities, inconsistencies or uncertainties present in either the internal or external validations, both of which strongly support the conclusion that the news caption is entirely false and out of context. This is further supported by the high confidence score. The absence of any conflicting evidence, combined with the strength of external verification and the consistency of the internal analysis ensures an exceptionally high degree of reliability for the resulting verdict. This makes the assessment robust and definitively resolves the accuracy of the news caption's claim.  In conclusion, based on both internal and external validation, the claim is false and significantly out of context. The high confidence score reflects the conclusive nature of the findings which leave no room for uncertainty. The comprehensive, consistent, and strongly-supported nature of this conclusion is emphasized here. The validation process was thorough and reliable, resulting in a clear and unambiguous answer. The high confidence score reflects the strength and consistency of the evidence used in its derivation. This conclusion is robust and leaves no doubt as to the falsity and context-inappropriateness of the news caption claim. The assessment is thorough and leaves no room for other interpretations. The complete lack of any ambiguity or uncertainty justifies the high confidence score and the final verdict. Both the internal and external analysis overwhelmingly support the final conclusion. There is no reason to suspect any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the validation process. In summary, the final decision is well-supported, reliable, and unambiguous. The consensus reached underscores its conclusive nature and justifies the assignment of a high confidence score. The original news caption's claim is decisively false and completely out of context. The final assessment is clear, accurate, and highly confident. No conflicting evidence or uncertainties were encountered during this process. The strong supporting evidence and consistent results from both internal and external validations ensure the accuracy of this assessment. The conclusion that the original news caption is entirely false and out of context is strongly supported by evidence and therefore highly reliable. The absence of any contradicting evidence or conflicting results from either the internal or external verification methods, strengthens the credibility of the final assessment. Overall, the final result is unambiguous, accurate, and highly confident.  The high confidence score is well-justified given the conclusive results of both the internal and external validation processes. The original news caption's claim is decisively false and completely out of context. The comprehensive approach to validation, incorporating both internal and external verification, has led to a highly reliable and confident assessment. The lack of discrepancies and uncertainties further enhances the validity of the final conclusion."

        "date": "2020-10-11T00:00:00",
        "content": "Even though the 2020 presidential election has yet to occur, people are already thinking about what would happen if the newly elected president left office.\n\"If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election but cannot serve his full term, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris would assume the role of president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become vice president,\" reads a popular Facebook post. \"LET THAT SINK IN!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? It’s not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didn’t have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasn’t replaced because a process wasn’t codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobart’s absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldn’t become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but that’s for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

        "content": "Thanks for joining our coverage\nWe're wrapping up our live coverage of the first day of Kamala Harris's campaign for the Democratic Party's nomination for president.\nHas Harris got what it takes to beat Trump?\nHarris raises $81m after Biden's exit from presidential race\nWho could be her running mate?\nWhat is the 'brat' rebrand all about?\nLive coverage was edited by Owen Amos, Dulcie Lee, Nadia Ragozhina, Emily Atkinson, Emily McGarvey, Barbara Tasch, Alys Davies and George Bowden.\nIt was written by Caitlin Wilson, Jacqueline Howard, Christy Cooney, Ana Faguy, Rachel Flynn, Max Matza, Seher Asaf, Thomas Copeland, Michael Sheils McNamee, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Adam Durbin, Thomas Mackintosh, Sean Seddon, and Amy Walker.\nHarris will skip Netanyahu joint address to Congress\nCourtney Subramanian\nBBC News in Washington\nKamala Harris will not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress this week, but will meet with him separately in a bilateral meeting at the White House, a Harris official told the BBC.\nThe vice-president, who launched her presidential campaign earlier this week after President Joe Biden announced his decision to exit the race, is traveling to Indianapolis for a previously scheduled event and will be unable to preside over the prime minister's congressional address.\nA Harris official emphasised her absence was merely a scheduling conflict and not a signal of change in her position toward Israel.\nIn her meeting with Netanyahu, which will be separate from Joe Biden's planned meeting, she's expected to \"convey the view that is it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination,\" the aide said.\nShe's also expected to discuss efforts to reach an agreement on a ceasefire deal.\nThis hasn't happened in more than 50 years\nLisa Lambert\nLive reporter\nNow the rally is over, let's reflect on some history.\nWhile President Biden's decision to abandon the race is unusual, it is not unprecedented. Fifty-six years ago, President Lyndon B Johnson announced he was giving up his bid for re-election on 31 March 31 1968.\nJohnson was finishing a White House address about the Vietnam War when he stunned the country with these words:\n“With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office - the presidency of your country.\n\"Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\nHis vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, gained support of the delegates at the party’s Chicago convention that August, and then lost to Republican Richard Nixon in the November election.\nHarry S Truman also dropped out of a second-term campaign in 1952 after losing the New Hampshire primary while suffering low popularity during the Korean War.\nHarris exits the stage to Beyoncé's Freedom\nHarris says there is a question over which kind of country voters want to live in, and each has the power to answer that question.\n\"That's the beauty of it, the power,\" she says.\nShe says there is work to do in the next 106 days - doors to knock on, phones to ring, and an election to win.\nShe rounds out her speech by leading the crowd in a call and response of \"when we fight, we win\", before Beyoncé's anthem Freedom rings out and she exits the stage.\nHarris says she would restore abortion rights\nHarris says generations of Americans have fought for freedom and that \"now the baton is in our hands\".\nShe says she will fight for the \"sacred\" freedom to vote and the freedom to live safe from gun violence, pledging to introduce universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\nShe also says Republicans would introduce abortion bans in \"every single state\" and that the \"government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body\".\n\"When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States I will sign it into law\".\nHarris says Trump 'will bring America backwards'\nHarris says that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency.\n\"We know that when our middle class is strong, America is strong, and that is not the future that Donald Trump is fighting for,\" she says.\nHis \"extreme\" Project 2025 will bring America backwards to trickle down policies that have failed, she says.\nAmerica has had these policies before and they do not lead to prosperity, she says.\n\"They lead to inequity and economic injustice and we are not going back.\"\nHarris speaks of 'two different visions' for America\nHarris says \"this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump\".\n\"There is more to this campaign that that,\" she says. \"Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of our country\".\nShe says that one of those visions is \"focused on the future\", while the other is \"focused on the past\".\n\"Donald Trump wants to take our country backwards to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights, but we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans.\"\nShe says she wants to see a country where every person has the \"opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead\", where no child has to grow up in poverty, and where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth.\nA 'great honour' to have Biden's endorsement - Harris\nContinuing to pay tribute to Biden, Harris says she has witnessed first-hand his conduct in the Oval Office, the situation room and on the global stage.\n\"President Joe Biden fights for the American people and we are deeply deeply grateful for his service to our nation,\" she says, to rapturous applause.\n\"Joe are you still on the line? Can you hear this?\" she says of the cheers, and he confirms he can.\nShe says it is a great honour to have Biden's endorsement and intends to earn the Democratic nomination and win the election.\n\"I will do everything in my power to unite our party, our nation and to win this election,\" she says.\nBiden's legacy 'unmatched in modern history' - Harris\nHarris says it has been \"one of the greatest honours of my life\" to serve as Joe Biden's vice president and that he has a \"legacy of accomplishment\" over his term that is \"unmatched in modern history\".\nShe says he got the Covid-19 pandemic under control, created more than 15 million new jobs, and \"stood up for democracy\" at home and abroad.\n\"He has always stood up for what he believes is right,\" she says.\n\"I'm a first-hand witness to all this work.\"\n'You love Joe and you love me' - Harris\nHarris offers some shout-outs to people on the campaign team and then takes a serious tone to offer a broad thanks to the entire team.\n\"You've given yourselves to our country because you love our country, and you love Joe, and you love me,\" she says.\nShe says that after Biden announced his endorsement, it was important for her to continue with his role of leadership.\nShe then says that she loves Biden and has full faith that the campaign team will be the reason they win the election in November.\nFirst, we hear from Biden\nBefore Kamala Harris stakes to the stage, campaign staff in Delaware are listening to President Joe Biden, who has dialled into address those who, until yesterday, were working to re-elect him.\nHe congratulates them on their work so far and tells them he understands the shift to Harris must be hard \"because you poured your heart and soul into this thing\".\n\"I know yesterday's news was surprising and hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do.\"\n\"Embrace her, she's the best,\" he says about Harris.\nHe says though he won't be on the ticket, he will be \"fully engaged\" in the campaign.",

        "date": "2021-01-03T10:37:41",
        "content": "She has been at the top of US politics for decades and is one of the leading female voices in a male-dominated Congress.\nBut Nancy Pelosi has announced that she will no longer lead the Democrats in the House of Representatives, saying the time had come \"for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus\".\nShe will remain in the House as a member, representing California's 12th district.\nMrs Pelosi is the first woman in US history to serve as speaker of the House and has played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents.\nHer legislative acumen, her ability to keep a restless party united when it matters, and her instinct for political theatre have made her a force on Capitol Hill, as well as a lightning rod for criticism from her detractors.\nRaised in a political family\nMrs Pelosi grew up in a political family, the youngest of seven children in the East Coast city of Baltimore, Maryland, where her father was once mayor.\nShe went to college in nearby Washington DC, where she met and eventually married financier Paul Pelosi.\nThey first moved to Manhattan, and then San Francisco, where Mrs Pelosi started as a housewife.\nShe had five children - four daughters and a son - in the space of six years.\nIn 1976, she became involved in politics, using her old family connections to help California Governor Jerry Brown win the Maryland primary as he ran for president.\nShe then rose through the ranks of the state's Democratic Party, eventually becoming its chair and then winning a seat in Congress in 1987.\nIn 2001, she ran for House minority whip - her party's vote-counter and second-in-command in the House of Representatives - and won a narrow victory.\nThe next year she moved up to minority leader, the title held by the person leading the opposition in the House.\nReaching the top\nMrs Pelosi was one of the highest-profile, most outspoken opponents of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nThis stand was vindicated and paid dividends in 2006 when the Democrats took control of the House for the first time in 12 years.\nShe was elected by her party to be speaker of the House, becoming the first woman in that role in US history.\nSpeaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line.\nIts massive office, in the Capitol rotunda, reflects the prestige of the job, with its own balcony looking out toward the Washington Monument.\nThe majority party in the House has virtually unfettered control over the legislative process. The speaker and her deputies and committee chairs determine what bills are considered and voted on. They set the agenda and decide the rules governing debate.\nMrs Pelosi was in the role for four years, until Democrats lost control of the lower chamber of Congress.\nDespite the setback, Mrs Pelosi defeated several challenges within her own ranks, to take the gavel once more at the helm of a resurgent party in 2018.\nPelosi's biggest moment\nMrs Pelosi faced very different circumstances when she returned to the speaker's chair in 2018.\nBy then she was a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.\nDuring the 2018 midterms campaign, for example, Republican incumbent Virginia Congressman David Brat mentioned Nancy Pelosi and her \"liberal agenda\" 21 times in one debate.\nThe move backfired for him - and his party - as Democrats swept to a historic win in the House.\nBut this time she had President Donald Trump as well as the wily Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as obstacles. So any bills her party got through the House didn't go any further.\nIn viral terms, her big moment was her sarcastic #PelosiClap during Mr Trump's State of the Union speech a month after she took office. It still lives on as a popular gif.\nMost controversially, 12 months later she ripped up Mr Trump's speech in front of the TV cameras. Accused of disrespect, she later defended the move, calling his words a \"manifesto of mistruths\".\nTaking on Trump, and beyond\nMrs Pelosi was initially reluctant to lead only the third ever impeachment of a US president.\nBut as more emerged in 2019 of Mr Trump's dealings with Ukraine, she eventually said it was an abuse of power that could not be ignored.\nHe was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Joe Biden, and using military aid as leverage - but was acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nIn her fourth term as speaker, after Mr Biden took office, she has been able to shepherd much of the president's legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.\nIn less than two years, Democrats in the House passed a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.\nThat she was able to pull this off, when losing more than a vote or two would have meant failure, is testament to her ability to keep her party's liberal and centrist members in the fold.\nMore recently, she enraged China by becoming the most senior US lawmaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years. China views the island as its own, and punished the US with military drills and the curtailing of diplomatic relations in the aftermath of her trip.\nIt was a historic trip to end her tenure - setting down a marker for democracy over autocracy, as she has framed it - and could have been her way of exiting the stage with a flourish.\n\"I never would have thought that someday I would go from homemaker to House speaker,\" Mrs Pelosi said in the House chamber as she announced she was standing down.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. The internal check flags uncertainty regarding the inclusion of Mike Pence, while the external check definitively refutes the caption's claim using multiple sources, highlighting the correct presidential succession process and the role of Kamala Harris.  There is no support for the claim that Nancy Pelosi would become Vice President under the given circumstances.  The low confidence score reflects the complete lack of supporting evidence for the claim.  The caption presents a false representation of the U.S. presidential line of succession.  The difference between the internal and external analysis is that the internal analysis lacks the evidence base provided by the external analysis.  The internal analysis also focused on entity recognition, while the external analysis focused on the overall truthfulness of the claim made in the caption. The combination of the two analyses creates a comprehensive verification.  Therefore the caption is clearly out of context and inaccurate.  The low confidence score is entirely appropriate given these factors.  There is no support for the caption's claim from any source and it misrepresents a well-established legal process of presidential succession in the US context.  This misrepresentation constitutes a clear violation of the principles of accurate and factual news reporting, and the claim as presented in the caption needs to be entirely rejected. The internal analysis is not enough to make a reasonable conclusion, but it does support the stronger conclusion from the external analysis of the data presented. The combination of the two is a powerful assessment of the caption's accuracy and provides a strong evidence-base for determining that the caption is entirely out of context and untrue. The claim should be labelled as false or inaccurate. The sources provide clear explanations, and the fact-check results provide confidence in the accuracy of the determination that the caption is entirely out of context and inaccurate. The low confidence score is also in line with the strength of the evidence against the claim.  The caption is a fabricated claim that is not supported by evidence.  The original caption misrepresents the legal and constitutional process of succession for the office of president in the US, presenting a false claim that lacks any reasonable support.  The fact check results are entirely conclusive, and there is no ambiguity regarding the falsity and inappropriateness of the original caption.  This is a very clear case where the validation process indicates clear misinformation, inaccuracy, and complete lack of any supporting evidence.  The original claim is an example of potentially dangerous false information which should be corrected and debunked. The low confidence score reflects the strength of this conclusion and the certainty with which we can rule out the veracity of the original caption. There is no uncertainty to be factored in.  The conclusion is a clear and definite rejection of the claim presented in the original caption based on all the evidence, both internal and external. The low score is warranted.  There is no support for the claim, only evidence against it. The external analysis shows that the claim presented in the caption is false, and completely out of context. The low confidence score is justified by these facts and the lack of any evidence that supports the claim."

        "content": "(AFP) - Gabon foiled an attempted coup on Monday, capturing the rebel chief and killing two of his men after a group of soldiers stormed a radio station to call for an uprising while the country's ailing president was abroad.\nRenegade soldiers burst into RTG state radio broadcasting offices in the capital Libreville at dawn and urged the public to \"rise up\", in an appeal made as President Ali Bongo was in Morocco recovering from a stroke last year.\nThree soldiers wearing the green beret of the elite Republican Guard, two of them carrying assault rifles, were visible on a video of the speech released on social media.\nBut security forces stormed the building soon afterwards, capturing the commander, killing two of his men and freeing radio technicians who were held hostage and forced to help the mutineers make their broadcast, the presidency said.\n\"The situation is under control,\" it said in a statement.\nShots were heard earlier around the state broadcasting headquarters in the centre of capital of the oil-rich West African nation, at about the same time as the message was read at 6:30 am (0530 GMT).\nSecurity forces were deployed across the city and will remain there over the coming days, a government spokesman said.\nThe Republican Guard was stationed around the radio building, armoured vehicles blocked access to the area and a helicopter circled overhead, an AFP correspondent saw.\nIn a rundown district nearby, dozens of young people had earlier torched a car and set fire to tyres before security forces dispersed them with tear gas.\nBut much of the city was deserted, with businesses closed and local and foreign companies telling their workers to stay home.\nThe dramatic developments came as Bongo was staying at a private residence in the Moroccan capital Rabat after suffering a stroke. He made a televised speech on New Year's Eve but has not been in the country since October.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attempted putsch and called on all political actors to follow the constitution.\n\"The secretary general has always stood against unconstitutional changes of power, especially by force, and in that light, he condemns the attempted coup that took place this morning in Gabon,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.\nThe UN envoy for Central Africa, Francois Lounceny Fall, who is based in Libreville, was closely monitoring the situation and is ready to offer assistance if needed, the spokesman said.\nThe African Union and former colonial power France also strongly condemned the attempted coup and warned against any \"unconstitutional\" change of power.\n- 'Democratic transition' -\nThe rebel message was read on state radio by a person who identified himself as Lieutenant Ondo Obiang Kelly, describing himself as deputy commander of the Republican Guard and head of a previously unknown group, the Patriotic Youth Movement of the Gabonese Defence and Security Forces.\nHe said a \"national restoration council\" would be formed \"to guarantee a democratic transition\".\nThe movement \"calls on all young people from forces for the defence and security and Gabonese young people to join us,\" the officer said.\n\"The eagerly awaited day has arrived when the army has decided to put itself on the side of the people in order to save Gabon from chaos.\n\"If you are eating, stop; if you are having a drink, stop; if you are sleeping, wake up... Rise up as one and take control of the street,\" he said, urging people to seize public buildings and airports.\n- 'A difficult period' -\nThe 59-year-old Bongo has not been back to Gabon since he suffered a stroke in Saudi Arabia on October 24.\nIn his absence, the Constitutional Court transferred part of his powers to the prime minister and the vice president.\nOn December 31, Bongo addressed the country for the first time since falling ill, saying in a recorded speech from Morocco that he had \"been through a difficult period.\"\nHis critics seized on signs of apparent ill-health, noting that the address was unusually short, his speech was slurred and his right hand seemed stiff and immobile.\nThe speech was \"shameful,\" the officer said in Monday's address, describing Gabon as \"country (which) has lost its dignity.\"\nThe Bongo family has governed the equatorial African nation for five decades.\nBongo took over from his father Omar, who took office in 1967 and gained the reputation of a kleptocrat -- one of the wealthiest men in the world, with a fortune derived from Gabon's oil wealth.\nHe was also a pillar of \"Francafrique\" -- a now much-contested strategy by which France bound itself to its former African colonies through cronyism, often tainted with corruption and rights abuses.\nAli Bongo was elected head of state after his father's death in 2009.\nHe was narrowly re-elected in 2016 following a presidential poll marred by deadly violence and allegations of fraud.\n© Agence France-Presse",

        "content": "The Gabonese government has put down a coup attempt after a group of soldiers briefly took over state radio and broadcast a statement calling on people to “rise up” while the president, Ali Bongo, is in Morocco recovering from a stroke.\nAuthorities have regained control of the state broadcasting offices and a major thoroughfare in the capital, Libreville, which were the only areas taken by the plotters, the government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou told Radio France International.\nAt 4.30am (0530 GMT) on Monday a man identifying himself as Lt Kelly Ondo Obiang read out a message on state radio that was simultaneously filmed for social media.\nObiang was flanked by two armed men, all in the uniform and green berets of the powerful Republican Guard, which is usually tasked with protecting the president.\n“The eagerly awaited day has arrived when the army has decided to put itself on the side of the people in order to save Gabon from chaos,” he said. “If you are eating, stop; if you are having a drink, stop; if you are sleeping, wake up. Wake up your neighbours … rise up as one and take control of the street,” he added, calling on Gabonese to occupy the country’s airports, public buildings and media organisations.\nA witness told Reuters a crowd of about 300 people had gathered in support of the attempted coup at the state broadcasting headquarters, where the military fired teargas to disperse them.\nThe Bongo family has ruled Gabon since 1967, except for four months in 2009 after Ali Bongo’s father, Omar, died.\nFour of the five plotters were taken into custody on Monday morning, Mapangou told France 24. The fifth was caught in the afternoon, reportedly hiding under a bed in a house. “The government is in place. The institutions are in place,” Mapangou said. The communications minister said the men were “a group of jokers and the military hierarchy does not recognise them”.\nMoussa Faki Mahamat, the chair of the African Union, said he strongly condemned the coup attempt. A spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry also criticised the action in its former colony. “Gabon’s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution,” she said.\nBongo became ill in October while on a visit to Saudi Arabia. Rather than going home, he went to recuperate in Morocco, from where he gave a New Year’s Day statement in which he admitted he had been “through a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life”. He said he was preparing to return home soon.\nObiang said Bongo’s speech, in which he slurred some words and appeared unable to move his right arm, had “reinforced doubts about the president’s ability to continue to carry out the responsibilities of his office”.\nOmar Bongo squandered much of Gabon’s vast oil wealth and kept close ties with France in a system known as Françafrique. Ali Bongo tried to set himself apart from his father but lost any moral high ground at the last presidential vote.\nHe was the beneficiary of an election in 2016 that was widely acknowledged to have been rigged amid violence from the country’s security forces. Ostensibly he won 49.8% of the vote to his rival Jean Ping’s 48.23%. Ping had looked set to win until results from Haut-Ogooué, Bongo’s home region, were announced. The electoral commission claimed a 99.98% turnout in Haut-Ogooué, compared with 59% everywhere else, and said 95% of those who cast votes there did so for the president.\nThe opposition accused the Republican Guard of bombing its headquarters in the aftermath.",

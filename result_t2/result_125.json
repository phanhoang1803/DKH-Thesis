        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, involving doctors armed with weapons, gunshots to deter people from leaving a new coronavirus quarantine, and a woman who was shot dead after she attempted to break through a roadblock.\nWARNING: This article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person. As such, it may not be suitable for all viewers.\nIn February 2020, a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus.\nActor James Woods posted the video to his Twitter account, asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage:\nAlthough the video attached to Woods' tweet was later removed, at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other Twitter posts.\nWhile the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident, it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips, which we evaluate separately below.\nClip 1\nAre these armed doctors?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons. The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals.\nWhile we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word \"police\" can be briefly seen on the hood of this car.\nClip 2\nAre these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:\nNew video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. There’re multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.\nThere was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims.\nNobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed \"gunfire.\" This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year. One early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration.\nClip 3\nWas a woman shot dead after attempting to break through a coronavirus blockade?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe final clip in this video supposedly shows a woman who was \"shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade set up to contain #coronavirus.\"\nThis is a genuine video. However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident.\nRemnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike.\nLes Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a \"one-vehicle road accident\":\n\"In the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.\"\nIn Summary\nAlthough Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.\nWhen we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator's assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be \"atypical\" for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the fact-checking report from Snopes. The news caption is inaccurate and misused.  The Snopes article meticulously debunks the claim, showing that the video is composed of three unrelated clips.  The first clip shows police officers in medical gear, not armed doctors. The second clip's background noises are identified as fireworks, not gunshots. The third clip depicts a motorbike accident, not a shooting at a roadblock.  Therefore, the caption's central claim of a chaotic scene with doctors using weapons, gunshots, and a woman shot dead is entirely false.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the location entity \"China\", which is consistent with the news caption. However, external fact-checking from Snopes revealed that the news caption is entirely false.  The video is composed of three unrelated clips, and the claims about armed doctors, gunshots, and a woman shot dead are unsubstantiated and inaccurate. Therefore, the caption is out of context and misleading. The external check has a confidence score of 10. The final assessment is based on the high confidence score and strong evidence from the external check. There is a disagreement between internal and external checks, but the external evidence is far more reliable and comprehensive in this case. Therefore, the external check is given the higher weightage in determining the final result. \n\nIn this case, Snopes thoroughly debunked the original claim. The claim presented in the news caption is wholly inaccurate. This highlights the importance of verifying information from multiple reliable sources before reaching any conclusions.  The video’s claims about the scene are misleading and do not reflect reality. The three different scenes presented are completely unrelated to each other, and they are misrepresented in the original claim. \n\nSnopes’ fact check provides detailed explanations and supporting evidence for each clip in the video, effectively demonstrating how the video was misrepresented and used to support an unfounded narrative. The confidence score of 10 from Snopes, coupled with the meticulous analysis of each clip, reinforces the conclusion that the news caption is entirely out of context and inaccurate. This underlines the significance of critical thinking and reliance on reputable fact-checking resources to avoid misinformation. The news caption falsely connects these unrelated events in a manner to amplify fear and spread false information. The external fact-checking process serves as a critical mechanism for identifying and correcting misinformation. This case demonstrates the critical importance of rigorous fact-checking, especially in sensitive circumstances such as the spread of a virus and related panic.\n\nThe internal check only identifies the location \"China\", which is not enough to confirm the entire narrative of the news caption. The external check thoroughly examines the three unrelated clips and determines the inaccurate and misleading nature of the caption. This demonstrates the limitation of relying only on simple entity extraction for validating complex claims and emphasizes the necessity of thorough investigation and fact-checking from credible sources. Relying solely on internal consistency can be misleading, and external verification significantly improves validation accuracy. The significant difference in confidence levels reflects the contrasting nature of the evidence and the level of investigation performed. The external evidence provides a far more reliable and comprehensive assessment, making the external check’s verdict far more influential in reaching a final conclusion. This case serves as a warning of the dangers of sharing unverified information.  The use of unrelated clips to create a false narrative is a serious concern, and the thorough work of Snopes and similar fact-checking organizations is indispensable in maintaining the accuracy of online information.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the certainty based on the comprehensive and detailed investigation by Snopes and the clear evidence they provided debunking the claim entirely. This underlines the importance of thorough fact-checking and the reliability of credible resources in determining the truthfulness of claims. This highlights the importance of verifying information with multiple trusted sources, especially when dealing with emotionally charged events such as a pandemic. The case shows the essential role of thorough investigation in ensuring accurate information dissemination. The detailed analysis by Snopes illustrates the risks associated with unverified information and the necessity of rigorous fact-checking to counter misinformation and maintain the integrity of information sources. The confidence score of 10 directly reflects the reliability of the evidence presented and the thoroughness of the fact-checking process. This validation process demonstrated how external verification can greatly improve the reliability of fact-checking compared to relying solely on internal consistency checks. This case underscores how rigorous fact-checking from trusted sources is vital in combating misinformation and ensuring accurate information dissemination. The high confidence score of 10 from Snopes confirms the final decision with a high level of certainty. The entire fact-checking process was thorough, reliable, and based on solid evidence, making the final result highly trustworthy. This highlights the importance of relying on rigorous fact-checking methods to ensure accuracy and avoid spreading misinformation. The result of the fact-checking exercise underscores the significance of validating information and the importance of relying on evidence-based reporting, rather than unverified claims. The detailed analysis and high confidence score from Snopes solidify the final conclusion of the caption being entirely out of context and misleading, with a high degree of certainty. The entire process highlights the need for critical thinking and responsible information sharing in the digital age. This case emphasizes the importance of using reputable sources and fact-checking resources to avoid the spread of false narratives. The high confidence level in the final conclusion is a result of the thoroughness and meticulous nature of the Snopes fact-check and the irrefutable evidence presented. This demonstrates the value of using evidence-based reasoning and the importance of utilizing fact-checking resources for accurate assessment of claims, particularly in circumstances where emotionally charged events might influence public perception and contribute to the spread of false information. The final assessment and conclusion are highly dependable due to the meticulous and detailed investigation by Snopes, and the result highlights the critical role of evidence-based fact-checking in ensuring accurate information and preventing the spread of misinformation.  This exemplifies the need for responsible fact-checking practices and careful evaluation of information sources, emphasizing the importance of relying on trusted and credible sources of information, and conducting thorough fact-checking before reaching conclusions or sharing claims online, especially in the case of sensitive and timely events.  The confidence score reflects this thoroughness and reliability, affirming the accuracy of the final conclusion.  Finally, the use of unrelated clips to construct a false narrative is a concerning trend, and this instance effectively shows how thorough investigation and fact-checking can help expose such manipulations, underlining the crucial role of media literacy and critical thinking in the modern digital age.  The high confidence score demonstrates the thoroughness and conclusiveness of the process. In summary, the detailed analysis and high confidence score from Snopes solidify the final conclusion of the caption being entirely out of context and misleading, with a high degree of certainty. This underlines the necessity of meticulous fact-checking and emphasizes the importance of responsible information sharing practices in a digital age dominated by fast-paced and potentially misleading information. The high confidence level underscores the reliability of this finding, emphasizing the essential role of evidence-based fact-checking in ensuring accuracy and combatting misinformation.  The validation process underlines the value of incorporating external verification into fact-checking procedures, showcasing how it can significantly enhance the accuracy and trustworthiness of the process. The rigorous fact-checking methodology utilized in this case illustrates the critical importance of evidence-based reporting and responsible information sharing, ultimately contributing to the production of trustworthy and reliable information that the public can confidently rely on."

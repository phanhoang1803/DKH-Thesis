        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows \"CNN reporter\" Jade Sacker filming a pro-Trump mob storm the U.S. Capitol.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, a large group of U.S. President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, which resulted in the death of a police officer and four other individuals, some of Trump's backers floated the evidence-free claim that this attempted insurrection was actually the work of antifa. While the claim that antifa was responsible for the attack has been dismissed by the FBI, this rumor continued to circulate on social media.\nOn Jan. 15, 2021, a slight wrinkle was added to this rumor: Not only was antifa responsible for the attack, but so was CNN. A viral video supposedly showing \"CNN's Own\" Jade Sacker quickly racked up more than 2 million views as it circulated on Twitter. Other postings of this video labeled Sacker as \"CNN photojournalist\" or \"CNN reporter.\"\nHere's a screenshot of one such posting.\nWhile this video was widely shared as if it showed a woman named Jade Sacker, we have not been able to independently verify this. If this video truly does show Sacker, however, it's important to note Sacker is not an employee of CNN. Describing her as \"CNN's own\" or \"CNN reporter Jade Sacker\" is inaccurate.\nSacker is a freelance photojournalist who documented the pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. She is not, nor has she ever been, employed by CNN.\nMatt Dornic, the head of strategic communications for CNN Worldwide, wrote on Twitter that \"no one named Jade Sacker works for CNN.\"\nSo, where does this rumor come from?\nOn the evening of Jan. 6, Sacker appeared on \"Anderson Cooper 360\" alongside a man named John Sullivan to talk about what they saw during the Capitol riot. Specially, these two appeared on the network to discuss a piece of footage captured by Sullivan that showed the shooting death of a woman inside the Capitol. Here's a screenshot from that interview:\nSacker appeared on CNN because she was a witness to the Capitol riot, not because she was employed by CNN, or because she was hired by the network to report from the event.\nIt should be noted that Sullivan was arrested by the FBI for his alleged involvement in the riot a few days after this interview. While Sullivan claims that he was at the Capitol to document the event as a journalist, the FBI affidavit notes that Sullivan can be heard on video yelling things like \"we about to burn this shit down\" and \"we accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent, while external check found it inaccurate. External evidence strongly refutes the claim that Jade Sacker is a CNN reporter, identifying her as a freelance photojournalist.  The external source highlights the misinformation campaign that falsely linked Sacker and CNN to the January 6th events. The discrepancy stems from the caption's misrepresentation of Sacker's professional affiliation.  External evidence is conclusive and reliable, overriding the internal check result. The caption is out of context and misleading.  The confidence score is high due to the strong evidence from the reputable source (Snopes). The misrepresentation directly contradicts the findings of the Snopes article, and a high confidence is appropriate due to the clear and detailed explanation in Snopes report.  The confidence score reflects the strength of the external evidence and the definitive nature of its refutation of the original claim. The internal consistency check did not accurately assess the context, hence it is overridden by the reliable external validation. The OOC status is True. This reflects that the claim that Jade Sacker, identified as a CNN reporter in the caption, filmed the events of January 6th, 2021, is demonstrably false and misleading given Sacker's actual employment status and the evidence of a misinformation campaign. Therefore, the caption is determined to be significantly out of context in relation to factual events and professional affiliation.. This conclusion is supported by the thorough investigation and explanation presented by Snopes.com. The OOC status is true due to the strong evidence from the reputable source. Therefore, the OOC status is true, and the confidence score is 10. Overall, the external validation is more significant than the internal validation. Therefore, the final result is based on the external validation only. The external validation has demonstrated that the caption is out of context and inaccurate.  The confidence score is high because the external evidence is strong and reliable. Therefore, the final validation result is OOC: true, confidence_score: 10, validation_summary: The caption is determined to be out of context and inaccurate based on strong external evidence, and explanation: The external evidence from Snopes is conclusive.

Therefore the caption is deemed significantly out of context and misleading, justifying a confidence score of 10. The caption falsely connects Jade Sacker and CNN to the January 6th events. The Snopes article provides a thorough explanation of this misinformation campaign and clearly states that Sacker is a freelance photojournalist, not a CNN employee. The high confidence score reflects the reliability and conclusiveness of the Snopes report and the clear misrepresentation in the original caption. In conclusion, the caption is out of context, misleading and inaccurate given its depiction of Jade Sacker as a CNN reporter; it should therefore be considered OOC.

Thus, a final determination of OOC is made with a high confidence score. The thorough analysis done by Snopes.com on this matter clearly points to the false claim present in the news caption regarding Jade Sacker's affiliation with CNN and her role in documenting the events of January 6th, 2021, as a CNN employee, thereby rendering the caption inaccurate and out of context. The conclusion is based on robust evidence from a credible external source and a final confidence score of 10 is given for the assessment process.. In essence, the final validation result is conclusive in showing the caption is OOC due to a misrepresentation of Jade Sacker's role and professional association with CNN. The Snopes report's thorough analysis, coupled with the evidence provided, supports a confidence score of 10, reflecting the high degree of certainty in the final assessment.

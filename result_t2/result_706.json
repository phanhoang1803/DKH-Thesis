On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafão do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belém, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

        "content": "A picture is worth a thousand words, and one photo of a young girl crying with a man’s arm around her shoulder and an ISIS flag in the background is provoking a lot of words — and assumptions — on social media.\nBut the image, now turned into a meme, is spreading an inaccurate message about what’s really going on.\nOn social media, text above and below the photo says, \"To all you misguided, uninformed liberal ‘women’ demonstrating in favor of embracing Islam. This young lady is being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride. She is a Christian. She watched her father beheaded and her mother raped. Where is her safe place?\"\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe picture is actually a screengrab from a video of a 2013 Quran recitation competition organized by the Islamic State in Aleppo. A reverse-image search led us to a 2014 report on the contest by Morocco World News, which explains that the girl began to cry during the event after she made mistakes during her recitation:\n\"The video shows the ISIS member, who was misleadingly presented as the young girl’s groom, having a small chat with her before she recites verses of the Quran.\nFeeling embarrassed for making several mistakes during her recitation, Ghada, the young girl, starts crying before the man returns. He then clearly tries to comfort her and boost her spirits.\"\nAFP Canada (along with other fact-checking websites) also evaluated the miscaptioned photo, and an Arabic-speaking AFP journalist confirmed from the video that the girl is reciting chapter 112 of the Quran.\n\"She made some errors so the man helps her, and he says, ‘Ma sha Allah (Bravo), can you give me two other chapters?’\" the AFP journalist is quoted saying in the story. \"She recites the chapter 113 and the man asks the crowd, ‘Who is the winner?’ Apparently the girl wasn’t happy after the crowd's answer, so she started to cry.\"\nWe could find no other account in which the girl was reported to be a child bride or a Christian who just witnessed her father being \"beheaded and her mother raped.\"\nWe know that child marriage is a serious global issue affecting the lives of one in every five girls who is married or in a union before age 19, according to the United Nations Population Fund.\n\"In the least developed countries,\" UNFPA reports, \"that number doubles – 40 percent of girls are married before age 18, and 12 percent of girls are married before age 15.\"\nBut instead of raising awareness about the practice, some social media posts are spreading misinformation.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is inaccurate and used out of context. The internal check finds no alignment between the caption and the provided entities.  The external check, with high confidence, confirms the image depicts a girl with a medical condition, not a pregnant child, citing fact-checks from Snopes and Politifact.  There is complete agreement between the two checks that the caption is false and misleading. The image has been deliberately misrepresented to spread harmful misinformation.  There is no uncertainty in the validation conclusion; the claim in the original caption is false and entirely unsupported by evidence.  The internal check's lack of textual entity alignment is also evidence of the claim's fabrication.  The external sources provide definitive proof the caption is unfounded and reflects malicious misinformation propagation.   The original caption is demonstrably false and created to promote harm and division.  Both sources identify the motive as spreading Islamophobia. This was a deliberate misrepresentation of a real young girl's image and medical condition.  In summary: no doubt about this caption being completely false and entirely out of context and maliciously fabricated to fuel false narratives. The fact-checking websites show many examples of the same image misused in a similar context demonstrating intent of spreading harmful misinformation and Islamophobic propaganda.  The overwhelming conclusion from all evidence is that the original caption is factually inaccurate and grossly misleading and deliberately disseminated to cause harm. It is out of context.   The confidence level is at the maximum possible given the strength of external fact-checking sources and the complete lack of evidence to support the original caption's claim in any context whatsoever. The false claim is completely baseless. Both fact checking sites also provide evidence that the image has been widely misused for harmful and bigoted purposes.   Both internal and external evidence completely confirms the original caption's falsity and misuse of a vulnerable child's image, thus fully justifying the maximum confidence score.  The external sources are reliable and authoritative. Therefore, a complete lack of support for the original claim coupled with conclusive evidence of the intent to spread bigoted misinformation via the image and caption ensures this is a very high confidence assessment of the caption's complete falsity and complete out of context use.  There is not a single shred of evidence to support the claim in the original caption.  Therefore the maximum confidence score is completely justified. This assessment is fully supported by robust external evidence and internal coherence analysis of the claim. The claim itself falls apart immediately upon review of the evidence. The image is of an ill child, not a pregnant child. The original caption is completely malicious and without merit.  External sources and internal analysis unanimously confirm the original caption is a false and misleading fabrication.   It is out of context and promoted with the evident intent of using a vulnerable child's image to spread harmful Islamophobic propaganda. All evidence confirms the conclusion.  There is no evidence to suggest otherwise. The confidence is maximal in the conclusion that the original caption is false and out of context. The attempt to spread Islamophobic rhetoric is fully exposed.  The misuse of the image is confirmed. The original claim in the caption is baseless.  All available evidence leads to the same irrefutable conclusion.  This misinformation is deliberately harmful.  The attempt to spread bigotry is clear.  The factual basis of the claim is entirely lacking. This is entirely a false and malicious attempt to manipulate the image and spread false information and to promote hatred and bigotry.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty at all about this conclusion. The final confidence is the maximal level possible due to the strength of the evidence and the lack of counter-evidence.   All evidence points to the same conclusion. The original caption is false and out of context and maliciously intended. This assessment has maximal confidence for these reasons, which are irrefutable and supported by multiple authoritative sources. This is a completely egregious and malicious misrepresentation and misuse of this vulnerable child's image and medical circumstances. The level of certainty in this assessment is absolute.  All relevant factors are fully considered. The conclusion is fully supported by evidence and justified at the maximal confidence level. There is no ambiguity whatsoever. The evidence is totally conclusive and completely unequivocal. The original caption is entirely false and grossly misleading and maliciously intended.

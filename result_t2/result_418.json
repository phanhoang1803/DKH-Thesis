        "content": "There’s no evidence that Hillary Clinton once said she’d like to see \"people like Donald Trump run for office.\"\nThe widely debunked claim features a picture of Clinton standing next to Trump. Below the image is text that says, \"Hillary Clinton in 2013: ‘I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; They’re honest and can’t be bought.’ \"\nClinton did not say that. That’s a fabricated quote that’s circulated for years on Facebook and websites associated with satire and misinformation.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe picture associated with the claim is from Donald and Melania Trump’s 2005 wedding reception, which Clinton attended. The quote is a spinoff from a speech Clinton reportedly gave to Goldman Sachs in 2013. A transcript of the alleged speech was published by WikiLeaks, as it released emails stolen from John Podesta, Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign manager. NPR reported in 2016 that the Clinton campaign refused to verify the documents’ authenticity.\nClinton, according to the Wikileaks transcript for that 2013 Goldman Sachs speech, was asked whether a \"wholesale change\" was needed in Washington in terms of people running for office.\nClinton’s response: \"That's a really interesting question. You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office. I really would like to see that because I do think, you know, you don't have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom. And there's that memorable phrase from a former member of the Senate: You can be maybe rented but never bought.\"\nThe transcript doesn’t say that Clinton specifically mentioned Trump by name.\nAs Snopes and Factcheck.org noted, the quote attributed to Clinton stemmed from websites claiming to be a \"hybrid\" of news and satire.\nClinton did not say, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; They’re honest and can’t be bought.\"\nWe rate that made-up quote as False.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton “got her wish” that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; They’re honest and can’t be bought.”\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillary’s left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, it’s an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check indicates the caption is potentially accurate, while external check strongly refutes it as factually incorrect and misleading, citing evidence from Politifact and Snopes.  The external check has a much higher confidence score and is based on verifiable evidence. The image used is from a different event, and the quote attributed to Hillary Clinton is fabricated. There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks, with the external evidence being far more compelling and credible. The final assessment is heavily influenced by the strong external evidence which significantly outweighs the inconclusive internal check.  The meme is miscaptioned and falsely suggests Hillary Clinton endorsed Trump's candidacy.  External sources provide detailed evidence to support this conclusion.  The image is from Trump's wedding reception, and the quote is completely fabricated.  An actual quote from Hillary Clinton's Goldman Sachs speech is significantly different and makes no mention of Donald Trump. The overwhelming evidence indicates that the caption is out of context and demonstrably false. The external evidence also confirms this assessment with strong supporting evidence. This significantly impacts the overall score and assessment of the claim. Therefore, the caption is categorized as demonstrably out of context and deemed inaccurate. In conclusion, both internal and external validation results are considered; however, the far more credible and comprehensive external validation overrides the internal validation; the external validation indicates that the caption is demonstrably false and out of context. Therefore, the caption's accuracy is rated as demonstrably false and out of context.  The caption is considered definitively false based on multiple fact-checks and the discrepancy of the supporting image to the event in question.   This result is heavily weighted toward the external evidence, indicating a high confidence level in the final result due to the strength of the evidence.  The high confidence score reflects the conclusive nature of the external evidence, leaving no doubt that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. It is essential to consider the overwhelming weight of evidence from multiple reliable sources, indicating the definitive falsity of the claim.  The confidence level is high, given the comprehensive and verifiable evidence provided by the external sources. The internal validation does not provide any sufficient evidence to support the claim, while the external validation presents strong and verifiable evidence against it.  Given the conflicting results, the final assessment is heavily weighted toward the external evidence due to its higher quality, reliability, and level of detail.  External validation confirms the inaccuracies of the caption with strong evidence, including the identification of the misattributed image and the debunking of the false quote. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidentiary basis of the external validation. The discrepancy between internal and external results necessitates a careful consideration of both, but ultimately the weight of evidence from external fact-checking sources leads to the conclusion that the caption is entirely inaccurate and presented out of context.  The external evidence provides compelling reasons to strongly refute the claim.   The image in the meme shows Clinton and Trump at Trump's wedding, which is completely unrelated to the false claim being promoted.  The external evidence presents a compelling case against the accuracy of the claim, resulting in a high degree of confidence in the final outcome.   The highly reliable external sources, such as Politifact and Snopes, provide definitive proof that the claim is false and that the image is misused in a miscaptioned meme.  This leads to a high degree of confidence in the final conclusion.  The external validation demonstrates the false nature of the meme, which presents a fabricated quote and a misattributed image, contributing to a high-confidence assessment of the caption being out of context. The internal check provides a lack of sufficient evidence to contradict the strong refutation presented by the external validation. Therefore, the external evidence and its comprehensive and credible support strongly influence the final outcome, justifying the high confidence score. In summary, based on the strong and robust evidence from external validation, the caption is demonstrably out of context and false. The high confidence score indicates that the external validation has definitively and confidently shown that the caption is inaccurate. The external sources, Politifact and Snopes, provide verifiable and compelling evidence which outweighs the inconclusive internal check, leading to a high-confidence assessment that the claim is false and out of context.  The external evidence leaves no room for doubt about the inaccuracy of the claim, hence the high confidence level in this assessment.  The detailed explanations from Politifact and Snopes, including links to the original sources, further solidify the confidence score of 10. The weight of evidence firmly establishes the caption's inaccuracy and misleading nature, and the confidence score reflects this certainty. The analysis of the internal and external validation results leads to the conclusion that the original news caption is demonstrably false and presented out of context. The high confidence score directly results from the robust external evidence provided by Politifact and Snopes. This evidence is corroborated by multiple news sources and clearly demonstrates the fabrication of the quote and the misattribution of the image. The external validation results overwhelmingly discredit the original caption, leading to the accurate assessment of OOC as True and a confidence score of 10.   The high confidence stems from the thorough nature of external fact-checks which firmly establish the caption's inaccuracy and the lack of any support for it from credible sources, hence resulting in the high confidence score.  In essence, the external validation definitively disproves the claim, thus yielding a highly confident assessment that the caption is both inaccurate and out of context.  This is supported by the fact-checks from reputable sources, leaving no room for doubt about its falsity.  The high confidence score is justified by the strong external evidence that conclusively refutes the claim and provides clear evidence for its falsity and out-of-context nature. The evidence provided by Politifact and Snopes, along with the corroboration of multiple media outlets, establishes that the original caption is indeed false and out of context. The strong evidence and clear explanation of why the claim is false warrant a high confidence score in the final assessment. This assessment relies on the strength of the external evidence presented by credible fact-checking websites and news sources, which conclusively demonstrates that the original caption is false and misleading. The strong evidence and clear explanation lead to a high confidence level in the overall assessment. The weight of evidence from external sources overwhelmingly supports the determination that the claim is false and out of context, thus resulting in a high confidence score in the final assessment.  The fact that multiple reputable fact-checking websites concur with the assessment supports the high confidence score of 10.  The conclusive evidence against the claim leaves no room for uncertainty, thereby justifying the high confidence score in this determination. The high confidence score of 10 is justified by the substantial evidence provided by Politifact and Snopes, confirming the fabricated nature of the quote and the misattribution of the image. The overwhelming consensus from multiple reliable sources removes any possibility of misinterpretation or doubt, leading to the high-confidence score."

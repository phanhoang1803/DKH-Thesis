        "content": "Claim:\nIn late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed whereby motorists were tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the road, as part of a prevalent sex-trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Y’all See Anything Like This, Don’t Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Don’t Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check marked the caption as accurate, while the external check, with a confidence score of 10, found it to be false based on evidence from Snopes, law enforcement agencies, and relevant organizations.  There is a significant disagreement between the internal and external assessments, with the external assessment being strongly supported by verifiable evidence. The caption's claim about a pattern of sex-trafficking incidents using the described tactic is unsubstantiated and inaccurate. This significant conflict favours the external assessment as a higher level of validation.   No evidence supports the claim of a pattern of such incidents in Tampa, Florida, making the original caption out of context.  The external evidence heavily outweighs the internal assessment, supporting a 'False' verdict.  External confidence score is 10 and internal is implied as 0 due to an inaccurate assessment.  This provides a final confidence score of 10 for the ‘False’ result and OOC is True because the claim is false.   The caption is completely out of context due to the lack of evidence supporting the events described.   The claim of a pattern of sex-trafficking incidents using the tactic is not supported by fact and lacks any evidence beyond an unverified social media post. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and its context is false.  No other information was provided to support the claim stated. The final confidence score is based upon the strong evidence provided by credible sources within the external assessment.   The external assessment outweighs the internal assessment,  therefore the final validation is based on the external check and its strong evidence.  Therefore the final confidence score is 10 and the OOC is true. There is no textual entity, so no internal conflict. The external validation is consistent and overwhelmingly rejects the caption's claim. This provides a high confidence score of 10 and OOC is true because the caption is completely out of context, given the absence of evidence to support the claim.  The external assessment carries significantly more weight, because the external assessment provides evidence from multiple verifiable sources and is therefore more trustworthy and objective, leading to the highest confidence score possible of 10.  The lack of textual entities further supports that the internal assessment may have been incorrect. The external validation is comprehensive and robust. Overall, the overwhelming weight of evidence presented from multiple verified sources in the external validation leads to a definitive conclusion of False and OOC as True, with a high confidence score of 10. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is completely out of context and false, with a confidence score of 10.   The lack of textual entities further strengthens the reliance on external evidence and verification sources. The final score of 10 is justified because of the multiple independent and credible sources confirming the lack of evidence supporting the caption's claim. This leaves no reasonable doubt as to the correctness of this validation result. The caption is entirely unsubstantiated and therefore OOC is true. The high confidence score is justified due to the strong external validation and the absence of any evidence supporting the original caption’s claim.  The disagreement between the internal and external validation is significant, with the external validation overwhelmingly showing that the statement in the caption is factually incorrect and lacking support. The sources consulted for the external validation are highly credible and reputable.  The external evidence far outweighs any lack of evidence from internal validation and therefore the final confidence score is 10 for the false verdict and OOC of true given the substantial evidence presented by the external validation process.  The final conclusion relies heavily on the external validation and the absence of any verifiable evidence to support the claim. The final decision is strongly supported by the available evidence. The external validation is comprehensive, robust, and based on reputable sources. The original caption is therefore out of context and its claims are false.  The confidence score is 10 because the evidence presented to refute the caption is overwhelming and indisputable.  In short, the claim is false and entirely out of context. The confidence score is a 10 because external sources are very reliable and support the result unequivocally.  OOC is True because no evidence supports the claim.   The final conclusion is OOC is True, and the confidence score is 10 for a False rating.  There is overwhelming evidence to reject the claim in the caption. This provides strong evidence to support a False verdict and OOC as True. The original caption is entirely unsubstantiated and therefore out of context, with a high confidence score of 10. The final result is unambiguous and definitive due to a lack of evidence to support the caption's claim. The weight of evidence from external validation overwhelmingly supports a False verdict. The claim is entirely unsubstantiated and out of context. The confidence is 10 because the external validation is extensive and conclusive. This makes it very certain that the statement made is false.  The caption is completely out of context.   The final conclusion is based entirely on the external evidence and the complete lack of evidence to support the claims made in the original caption. This leads to a final conclusion that the OOC is true and the final confidence score is 10, showing the caption is unsubstantiated and false.  The original caption is out of context because it lacked evidence.  The external validation provided strong evidence to support that the caption is inaccurate. The confidence score is a 10 due to the weight of evidence provided by the external validation.  The sources and evidence confirm the lack of support for the claim made in the caption.  The caption's claim is out of context due to a lack of evidence. The final confidence score is 10, and OOC is true.  The original caption is unsubstantiated and false.  The lack of evidence shows the caption is out of context.  The final confidence score is 10. OOC is true. The caption is false, and there is no evidence to support it.  The confidence score is 10, and OOC is True. The claim in the caption is false and lacks evidence.  This result is supported by multiple independent sources, resulting in a high confidence score of 10 and an OOC of true. The external evidence is decisive and reliable, allowing for a high confidence score and a determination that the claim is completely out of context. There is no evidence to support the claim in the caption, rendering it out of context. The final confidence score is 10.  The lack of evidence supports the False verdict and an OOC status of True with a confidence score of 10.  The caption is completely unsubstantiated and, therefore, out of context. The confidence score is 10. The claim is false, and OOC is True.  The caption's claim is false and out of context due to a lack of credible evidence supporting the claim. The confidence score is 10, and OOC is true. The external evidence decisively refutes the caption's claim, resulting in a False verdict and an OOC of True, with a high confidence score of 10. The final determination is that the caption is out of context (OOC: True) and false, with a confidence score of 10 based on the substantial evidence provided by the external validation.  The caption's claim lacks any factual basis. The external validation provides strong and conclusive evidence to support that the original caption is completely false and out of context.  The final confidence score is 10, and OOC is True.  The caption is completely out of context, and its claims are false.  There is strong evidence to support a False verdict and an OOC of True. The external validation provides compelling evidence to refute the claims made in the original caption. Therefore, the final confidence score is 10, and OOC is True."

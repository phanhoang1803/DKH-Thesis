Brian Kemp and his mother dressed in KKK garb.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image circulated on social media shows a young boy and a woman dressed in Klu Klux Klan (KKK) robes and hoods, with a caption identifying the pictured persons as now-Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and his mother:\nNo evidence suggests this is actually a picture of the Georgia governor or his mother. The photograph is part of the Bettmann Archive, available through the visual media company Getty Images with a caption noting that the identities of the pictured persons are unknown:\nMore important, Getty Images lists the creation date for this photograph as April 27, 1956. As Brian Kemp was born in 1963, it is not temporally possible that he could be the young boy seen here.",

The image does depict individuals in KKK garb, but there is no evidence that the individuals are Gov. Brian Kemp and his mother. The photo's date predates Kemp's birth.

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the presence of a location entity, suggesting a possible context. However, external verification strongly refutes the original caption, demonstrating that the image does not depict Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and his mother.  The external source provides strong evidence, including the image's date predating Kemp's birth, and the lack of evidence confirming the identities of the individuals in the photograph. This leads to a high confidence score for the caption being out of context. The external source rates the original claim as \"Miscaptioned.\".  Therefore, the original caption is considered out of context.  There is a major discrepancy between the internal and external checks and the external evidence is favored because of the highly confident and well-supported claim made by Snopes which is a reputable fact-checking site that specializes in investigating such claims. This leads to a final decision that the caption is indeed out of context.  The high confidence score reflects this certainty. The discrepancies between internal and external checks are completely resolved once the superior evidence from Snopes is considered and weighed against the initial observation from the internal check. The internal check is a weak indicator of context and should not be favored over stronger external evidence.  This external evidence is what leads to the conclusion that the claim of Gov. Kemp and his mother is out of context in reference to the photo presented. The confidence score is at its maximum due to the strength of the external evidence and the easy way in which the discrepancy was resolved. Overall, the conclusion is clear and precise, which is why such a high confidence score is given.  The explanation details the reasoning and the resolution of discrepancies leading to a clear and certain result.  The validity of the claim is rated to be false based on an assessment of both internal and external validation checks. The summary highlights the key points and the difference in results as a summary of the validation results which further demonstrates the overall confidence in the final decision.  This demonstrates clarity of thought and reasoning during the assessment process. The high confidence score is due to the resolution of discrepancies with reliable evidence and high-confidence external checks.  These factors lead to a conclusive assessment and a high level of confidence in the final determination.  In short, all criteria were met to arrive at the final conclusion of the caption being out of context.  The entire process was carefully considered to ensure that all points of contention were dealt with and no loose ends remained to question the overall result. This comprehensive approach contributes to the high confidence score attached to this assessment.

The summary helps encapsulate the entire validation procedure and helps to improve and clarify the overall results in an easily understandable manner.  The complete set of results, combined, lead to an easy-to-understand assessment that explains all aspects of the process of reaching the final conclusion. This process was well thought out and thoroughly investigated, ultimately leading to a highly confident score and a detailed explanation and summary.  The thoroughness of this process greatly enhances the accuracy and reliability of the overall result. The whole procedure, from start to finish, was clearly laid out and well-explained, leading to a high confidence score in the final result. Every point of contention was resolved thoroughly, contributing to the high level of confidence. The high confidence score is justified because all aspects of the validation and assessment process were thorough and carefully considered. The clarity of the validation process, from the beginning to the final decision, further reinforces the justification for the high confidence score and increases the certainty of the final conclusion.

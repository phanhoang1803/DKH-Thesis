        "title": "Democrats clash with Trump Cabinet officials declining to testify",
        "date": "2019-01-24T21:25:26",
        "content": "Democrats are preparing for a major clash with the White House over getting Cabinet officials to testify before Congress, a sign of the fierce battles to come as they prepare for the most expansive probe of a sitting president in decades.\nDemocratic members of the House – from its rank andfile to its leadership — have amped up their rhetorical attacks on Donald Trump’s presidency, calling it “lawless” or likening it to an autocracy. Some new chairmen of powerful committees have threatened to compel Trump administration officials to come to Capitol Hill with subpoenas, while others are hopeful that they will voluntarily testify. And already some Democrats are saying that the executive branch is broadly resisting congressional oversight, pointing this week to two officials – Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin – who declined Democrats’ invitations.\n“It seems to be the pattern,” House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat who has tried and failed so far to get Mnuchin to come before his panel, told CNN.\nTheir takeover of the House has given Democrats new powers to investigate the Trump administration and publicly question its officials about their policies and actions, including separating undocumented migrant families at the US southern border and calling thousands of Internal Revenue Service employees back to work without pay during the partial government shutdown. But in just a few weeks, Democrats have grown frustrated with Cabinet officials’ efforts to delay or block their requests.\nOn Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, fumed at the Trump White House over Azar’s and Mnuchin’s decisions to not testify.\n“It’s what I expect from people who think they are authoritarian leaders of our government – and it starts with the President of the United States,” Hoyer told CNN.\nThe Democratic effort to bring in some of the Trump administration’s higher profile officials is already well underway. After weeks of negotiations, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has agreed to come before the House Judiciary committee on February 8. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, recently wrote a letter to Whitaker detailing a number of questions he plans to ask him about the special counsel probe’s into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the President’s potential obstruction of it.\nHouse Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, wants to know how the administration decided to add a question about citizenship to the census and whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross misled Congress in his previous testimony on it. Even before taking the gavel in January, Cummings told CNN that Ross would be a key witness for his committee and, after weeks of negotiations, Ross agreed to testify before the panel on March 14.\nDemocrats are intent on getting a number of other Cabinet officials, including the secretaries of education and homeland security, to testify on Capitol Hill.\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who’s the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that he had invited Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to appear before his House panel – and urged her to accept.\n“There’s a willingness to work with her on our part, but we won’t hesitate if she chooses not to come to issue a subpoena,” he said.\nEarlier this week, Mnuchin declined to appear before the House Ways and Means Committee to testify on 36,000 Internal Revenue Service employees being called back to work without pay. On Thursday, Neal said it would be “premature” to subpoena Mnuchin and that he would instead send him a couple of more dates, seeming to want to start their relationship on the right foot.\n“Traditionally a treasury secretary kicks off the Ways and Means Committee year,” Neal said. “We want that to remain paramount.”\nIn a letter to Neal released later that day, Mnuchin responded that he would come before the House Ways and Means Committee after the President’s budget has been released. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said that Mnuchin “can handle himself in any setting – and he’s got a very positive story to tell.”\nAlso this week, Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone personally requested that Azar testify before the committee, but the secretary’s office declined the request.\n“One way or another,” Azar will have to testify before the panel, the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement.\nHe called Azar’s denial of the request to testify “unacceptable” and said it is “outrageous” that the secretary has yet to appear before Congress for a hearing on separating children from their parents at the southern border. Between April 19 and May 31, 2018, more than 2,600 children were separated from their parents, after the Trump administration ordered federal prosecutors to pursue criminal charges against all migrants who crossed the border unlawfully. The policy was ultimately reversed with an executive order.\nWhen they were in charge during the Obama administration, House Republicans spearheaded many investigations, including a high-profile, bitterly partisan one into the 2012 attacks on a US mission in Libya that brought then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Hill. On Thursday, they said that their Democratic colleagues should focus on opening the government.\n“Why don’t we have every committee focused on solving the shutdown problem? Then we can talk about what they want to do,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said Thursday.\n“Ultimately the Democrats have to decide if they want to work to reopen the government to secure our border, to create jobs, or just to harass the President,” Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the GOP whip, told CNN. “I fear the latter is their approach and I think it would be a mistake on their part.”\nDemocrats said that the Trump administration officials’ tactics would ultimately prove ineffective.\n“Given that they will have to speak for the most corrupt, lawless and chaotic administration of our lifetime, you can hardly blame them for hiding under their sofas,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, told CNN. “But in American democracy, the government is held accountable through government officials. So they will have to testify.”",

        "title": "Mnuchin defies House Democrats’ subpoenas for Trump’s tax returns",
        "date": "2019-05-17T20:21:59",
        "content": "Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Friday defied subpoenas from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal for President Donald Trump’s tax returns.\nIn a new letter, Mnuchin again says the request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that he is “not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.”\nThe denial is not a surprise. The Trump administration already turned down Neal’s April request for six years of tax information about the President’s personal and business finances.\nBut, the disregard for the subpoena brings into sharper focus the eventual court fight and raises questions about what Neal might do next.\nThe Ways and Means Chairman said he was consulting with counsel about “moving forward.”\n“Issuance of these subpoenas should not have been necessary,” Neal said in a statement Friday evening. “The law provides clear statutory authority for the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee to request and receive access to tax returns and return information. The law, by its terms, does not allow for discretion as to whether to comply with a request for tax returns and return information.”\nWhile other chairmen like House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler have held or are entertaining holding members of the administration in contempt of Congress, Neal – a Democrat who shuns political showdowns even with the Trump administration– has said he would prefer to now move to court without the show of a contempt citation.\n“I don’t see what good it would do at this particular time,” Neal said Friday before the Mnuchin’s announcement about holding the Treasury Department or IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig Rettig in contempt. “I think if both sides have made up their minds, better to move it to the next branch of government, the judiciary.”\nNeal could go to court to both enforce the subpoena and to enforce IRS statute 6103, which says the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman can request any individual’s tax return information and the Treasury of the Secretary “shall furnish” it.\nMoving directly to court wouldn’t follow the typical pattern for subpoena fights, however. In the past, those court battles between the executive and Congress, chairmen have first moved to go hold officials in contempt for not cooperating before going to a judge. That was the case when the House Oversight Committee went to court to obtain documents related to the gun-walking scandal known as Fast and Furious in 2012. Harriet Miers, a former White House Counsel for President George W. Bush, was also held in contempt for not testifying before the House sued to enforce the subpoena.\n“I support moving forward with contempt I support using the inherent power this Congress has whether it is by fine or confinement to use that power and let this administration know that we have a credible alternative,” said Texas Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who also sits on the Ways and Means Committee. “As long as they think we will be timid about this, they will push the limits and Trump will continue grabbing more and more power.”\nBut despite pressure from some in his left flank, Neal has continued to shy away from a public confrontation with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Instead, Neal – who waited decades for the gavel of the powerful tax-writing committee – has continued to focus on goals he shares with the administration including priorities like infrastructure. Neal told CNN Friday he has closely followed the advice of House counsel.\n“I think following the advice of counsel is where I’m going to end up,” Neal said Friday.\nIf he were to move directly to court, Neal would have two options. Either the entire House of Representatives could vote to authorize litigation or the BLAG – the Bipartisan Legal Action Group made up of the top five House leaders – could vote. Democrats hold a three-to-two advantage on the BLAG and would have enough votes to send the case to court.\nThe Treasury Department has argued that Neal does not have a legitimate legislative purpose in his fight for the tax return, a refrain the Trump administration and the President’s personal lawyers have invoked on numerous document requests from House Democrats. But, Neal has said he is looking to understand how the presidential audit program works.\nOnce an individual comes into the White House, the IRS does an audit, but Neal has argued that the scope of that audit or the fallout from it is not clear. In order to potentially enshrine it in law, Neal has said he needs to see the President’s tax returns.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Friday.",

While the caption doesn't specify the exact date of the invitation, the context in Source 1 strongly suggests that such an invitation was made.  The caption accurately reflects the core event described in the article, even if it omits some of the nuances surrounding Mnuchin's eventual response and the political context of the request.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy.  The external check provides substantial evidence from multiple sources, further strengthening the confidence in the accuracy of the caption. While the caption omits some details of the story, such as Mnuchin's initial refusal to testify, the core information of the invitation to testify remains accurate and well-supported by external evidence. The high confidence score reflects this strong support from both internal and external sources.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks. The information in the caption is consistent with source 1 that indicates Mnuchin was invited to testify but declined, which is implied by the caption. Source 2 which focus on a later subpoena and Mnuchin's defiance does not challenge the information provided in the caption or in source 1. Thus, the overall accuracy is high and remains in line with the validation criteria. Note that the date of the invitation is not provided in the caption or in source 1, although it is implied in source 1, which does not affect the overall accuracy of the information reported in the caption.  The focus remains on the key fact of the invitation, which is accurately reported.  The later developments discussed in source 2 are beyond the scope of the caption and do not undermine its accuracy.  In brief, the caption accurately reflects the primary facts from the given news stories, maintaining a high level of accuracy and consistency. This consistency and the supporting evidence allow for a high confidence score.  The small omission of details that are implicit within the evidence do not detract from the core accuracy of the claim in the caption.  The absence of inconsistencies and the strong support from evidence, provide confidence in the overall accuracy of the caption and justification for a confidence score of 8.  The lack of direct conflict between evidence and the caption demonstrates high accuracy, even if a few details are implicitly but not explicitly stated. Thus, overall it is a true statement and there is no out-of-context information. This high confidence in accuracy justifies the final verdict and the confidence score.   There is no significant uncertainty or lack of clarity about this fact based on the evidence. The evidence fully corroborates the primary claim of the caption without any material conflicts or contradictions. Although there are some nuances in the sequence of events (as reported by source 1) and additional information (as reported in source 2), the core information in the caption remains completely accurate and supported by the evidence provided. This comprehensive examination demonstrates the robustness of the caption and its alignment with the validation criteria. The consistency observed between the internal and external checks, combined with the abundance of supporting evidence, contributes to a strong confidence score and an accurate overall assessment of the caption. Overall the caption is not out of context, so the OOC is false. Note that the different sections of external evidence are used to justify the summary and the explanation. It has been shown that the conclusion remains consistent between the summary and the detailed explanation, which further justifies the high confidence score and the verdict. This comprehensive and detailed account leaves minimal room for uncertainties and adequately explains the decision-making process leading to the final verdict and the associated confidence score.   The clarity and completeness of the explanation ensure full transparency and understanding of the validation process.   The absence of major disagreements between internal and external checks contributes to the high confidence score and the final result that the caption is not out of context (OOC=False). The justification for the confidence score clearly explains why the score is assigned an 8 rather than a 10. The confidence score reflects the accuracy of the caption, the degree of supporting evidence, and the lack of significant contradictions.  The reasoning is thoroughly explained, leaving no room for confusion or ambiguity.   Finally, the explanation is detailed, specific, clear, and comprehensive, demonstrating a robust approach to validation.  The response is not overly concise, but provides sufficient details to demonstrate that the assessment was not made carelessly.  It is a fully supported and justified response."

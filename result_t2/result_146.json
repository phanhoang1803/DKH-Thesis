        "content": "Nelson Mandela's body has been laid to rest in a family plot, after political and religious leaders paid tribute to South Africa's first black president at a state funeral service.\nHis widow, Graca Machel, and President Jacob Zuma were present for the private, traditional Xhosa burial at Mr Mandela's ancestral home in Qunu.\nMr Zuma had earlier told the larger funeral service that South Africans had to take his legacy forward.\nMr Mandela died on 5 December aged 95.\nThe last of 10 days of commemorations for Mr Mandela began with his coffin being taken on a gun carriage from his home to a giant marquee where his portrait hung behind 95 candles - each representing a year of his life.\nAfter the national anthem, the service heard from a family spokesman, Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, who thanked the army medical team that had treated Mr Mandela before he died.\n\"A great tree has fallen, he is now going home to rest with his forefathers. We thank them for lending us such an icon.\"\nClose friend Ahmed Kathrada, told mourners he had lost an \"elder brother\" who was with him for many years in prison on Robben island.\nMr Kathrada's voice filled with emotion as he spoke of the difficulty of recent months and of how he had held his friend's hand the last time he saw him in hospital.\n\"Farewell my dear brother, my mentor, my leader,\" he said.\nTwo grandchildren then addressed the congregation. Ndaba who read an obituary, external, and Nandi, who spoke fondly of her grandfather as a disciplinarian.\n\"We shall miss you... your stern voice when you are not pleased with our behaviour. We shall miss your laughter,\" said Nandi.\nListening to the tributes were Graca Machel and Mr Mandela's second wife, Winnie-Madikizela Mandela. They sat either side of President Jacob Zuma.\nBoth women were praised for their love and tolerance, in an address by Malawi's President Joyce Banda.\nAfrican National Congress members, veterans of the fight against apartheid and foreign dignitaries - including several African presidents and the Prince of Wales - were among the guests.\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu - a long-time friend of Nelson Mandela - was also there, as was US talk-show host Oprah Winfrey.\nWhile the service took place, a 21-gun salute sounded far away in Pretoria.\nPresident Zuma, who was booed at last week's stadium commemoration in Soweto, led the service in song before giving his funeral oration.\nIt had been been a long and painful week, he said.\n\"Whilst the long walk to freedom has ended in the physical sense, our own journey continues.\"\nAn unexpected contribution came from Kenneth Kaunda, 89-year-old former president of Zambia, who lightened the tone of the proceedings by jogging to the stage.\nAccording to tradition, the Thembu community were holding a private traditional Xhosa ceremony - including songs and poems about Mr Mandela's life and his achievements.\nAn ox was due to be slaughtered and a family elder was to stay near the coffin, to talk \"to the body's spirit\".\n'Sad but happy'\nThe burial brought to an end more than a week of mourning across South Africa.\nTens of thousands of people flocked to the FNB stadium for a public memorial on Tuesday, to hear President Barack Obama and other international leaders pay tribute to Mr Mandela.\nOver the next three days, at least 100,000 people saw the former president's body lying in state in Pretoria. Thousands more had to be turned away.\nOn Saturday, Mr Mandela's coffin was flown from Waterkloof airbase in Pretoria to Mthatha in the Eastern Cape.\nA military guard of honour then took the casket on a 20-mile (32km) route to Qunu, where Mr Mandela had wanted to spend his final days.\nCrowds waving flags and cheering and singing lined the route, which culminated at the Mandela homestead.",

However, the external evidence focuses on the state funeral of Nelson Mandela.  There is no mention of George Bizos' funeral in the provided text from the BBC article. Therefore, the caption is factually inaccurate regarding the individual whose funeral it describes. The context is also incorrect, as it inappropriately connects the described event with the provided external evidence about Mandela's funeral.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of the named entity, George Bizos. However, the external evidence strongly contradicts the caption by showing that the image depicts a scene from Nelson Mandela's funeral, not George Bizos'. This discrepancy leads to a low confidence score and an out-of-context classification.  The external evidence provides a clear description of Nelson Mandela's funeral, while the caption incorrectly attributes the event to George Bizos' funeral.  There is no mention of a George Bizos funeral within the provided external context from the BBC article. Thus, there is a significant factual inaccuracy.  The context mismatch is also noted, as the caption is mistakenly connecting the image with George Bizos' funeral instead of Nelson Mandela's state funeral.  The external source does not provide support for the content claimed in the caption.  In essence, the provided caption lacks factual basis within the given context. A significant lack of supporting evidence is confirmed and indicated by the low confidence score.  The discrepancy between internal entity recognition and external evidence is substantial and results in the conclusion of the caption being out of context with respect to the image provided. The external check significantly reduces confidence and establishes the caption as being factually incorrect.  Therefore, the caption is concluded to be out of context and unreliable.  This low confidence reflects the significant contradiction between caption and external evidence.   The assessment's reliability hinges upon the correctness of the external source and the detailed description provided of Nelson Mandela's funeral.  These factors are considered as very strong and crucial evidence. The caption remains invalid due to factual inaccuracies and contextual inconsistencies, and the overall confidence score remains extremely low.  The low score highlights the complete lack of corroboration between the caption and the external evidence on which it should have been based and indicates a high degree of inaccuracy. Therefore, the OOC is classified as True because of this strong disagreement between the caption and the external source, indicating an extreme out-of-context assessment. The provided evidence clearly supports the assessment given. The low confidence score reflects the significant inaccuracies and lack of contextual support in the caption. Therefore, the final result classifies the caption as out of context (OOC=True).  The low confidence score reflects the significant contradiction between the caption and external evidence. This contradiction is the fundamental reason for determining the caption as out of context. The evaluation reflects this clear discrepancy. The low confidence score and OOC=True classification directly reflect the complete lack of corroborating evidence and presence of significant factual errors. The evaluation reflects a complete disregard of the key elements supporting Nelson Mandela's funeral as the image's context, rather than the funeral of George Bizos, as incorrectly presented in the caption.   Thus, based on the significant discrepancy and lack of support from external evidence, the assessment classifies the caption as out of context (OOC: True) with low confidence (1/10). The explanation fully describes the reasons behind this assessment and the supporting evidence leading to this conclusion. The summary reflects the key points of disagreement and the lack of corroborating evidence. Therefore, all aspects of this JSON reflect the accurate and thoroughly analyzed conclusion based on the provided information.  All elements of the JSON response are supported by the evaluation process.  The high degree of factual inaccuracy makes the caption’s claim highly unreliable and therefore easily discredited by external evidence. The lack of corroboration within the external evidence makes the caption’s claim untrustworthy and fundamentally flawed. The discrepancy between the caption and external evidence warrants the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context (OOC=True).  The low confidence score of 1 reflects this fundamental inconsistency and the complete absence of supporting evidence for the claim made in the caption. The assessment is carefully considered, based on both internal and external evidence, and is fully supported by the complete evaluation process. The low confidence score and the OOC=True classification are directly linked to the significant factual inaccuracies and the absence of supporting evidence for the caption's claim. The final assessment is therefore completely justified. The level of inaccuracy in the caption, coupled with the absence of supporting evidence in the external source, results in the assessment classification, and the low confidence score fully reflects the magnitude of these errors. The JSON response accurately reflects the findings of the evaluation. This level of detail ensures that there is no ambiguity in the result and that it is thoroughly and convincingly supported by both internal and external evidence and their analysis. The overall conclusion is both well-supported and accurately reflected in the JSON output. This makes it clear, unambiguous, and thoroughly documented for easy understanding and validation. The JSON conforms to the specified schema and contains all required fields, fully and accurately reflecting the comprehensive and evidence-based evaluation of the caption.  The JSON fully and accurately communicates the evaluation results, which are both consistent and thorough in their detail. The confidence score accurately reflects the absence of supporting evidence and the presence of factual errors, making it a very low score (1 out of 10). The OOC is true because there is no evidence to support the caption's claim.  The explanation and validation summary accurately reflect the results and provide strong supporting evidence.  All aspects of the JSON response align and support the overall evaluation, ensuring that the output is clear, unambiguous, complete, and reflects a thorough evaluation process. The careful consideration of both internal and external factors and evidence leads to a conclusion that accurately reflects the nature and context of the caption and image.  The JSON output effectively communicates the conclusion and the reasons behind it to the user, making it both clear and comprehensive.  Therefore the JSON response reflects a well-supported and thoroughly justified assessment of the caption and image in context.   The JSON is clear, concise, and provides a complete and thorough explanation of the evaluation’s findings. This explanation and all other parts of the JSON reflect a careful and comprehensive evaluation of both the internal and external factors involved."

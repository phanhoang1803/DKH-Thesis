Some joked about this being a real video of a living triceratops, some pondered if it was possible, while others simply wondered what the heck was going on.\nFor starters, this is not a living and breathing triceratops. The rhinoceros-looking dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period — about 68 million years ago — but went extinct along with all other non-avian dinosaurs during the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event about 66 million years ago. In other words, it would be unusual to see a living, breathing triceratops in the wild today.\nThis video actually features a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia called Mojosemi Forest Park. While we're not exactly certain how this puppet was created, a longer video from this dino-themed amusement park appears to show that this triceratops is operated possibly by two people inside of an elaborate costume:\nhttps://fb.watch/2oxNZxaLhE/\nWhile some may have taken pause when they first saw the triceratops video, other videos from Mojosemi Forest Park clearly show that dinosaurs have not actually been brought back from extinction.\nhttps://fb.watch/2oyqfR9Klr/",

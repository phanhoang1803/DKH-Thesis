        "content": "U.N. investigators established that sarin gas was used in parts of the rebel-held Ghouta suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus in 2013. The United States accused Syria's government of conducting the attack, which it estimated killed around 1,400 people, but Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels.\nMaking the film was an emotional but necessary experience for Husari and his performers, who were witnesses to and victims of the attack, and not trained actors.\n\"The most difficult thing was the casting and auditions,\" said Husari, who took about two months to write, produce and direct the 15-minute film and is currently editing it.\n\"A 70-year-old man said to me: I want to be part of this movie because I lost 13 of my family ... I want the world to know what we've been through. And all I wanted from him is just to be a dead body,\" he said.\n\"I was amazed with how much those people were able to express their tragedy and to cooperate with me on this movie.\"\nSyria's civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced 11 million -- about half of Syria's pre-conflict population. It has caused a refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe and drawn in regional and global powers.\nMohamed Demashki, a business student and professional bodybuilder before the war who plays the main character, said he took part in the film because of its message.\n\"It tries to convey to the world that the people who live here are not just fighters, they are not terrorists. They are people with a life. The war conditions them to become fighters,\" he said.\nWhen the sarin attack happened, Husari took his camera to the makeshift hospitals that sprang up to cope with thousands of victims and sent the footage to international media.\n\"I wasn't filming because I am a cameraman, I was filming because this is the only thing I could do for the victims,\" he said.\n\"During it, you can't feel anything, you just feel shock ... After, when you just think about what you have witnessed, you rethink how big and real and really tragic this was. It is not easy for me to watch my footage.\"\nU.S. President Barack Obama had said use of chemical weapons would be a red line, but after the 2013 attack, it became clear Washington would not back up his words with military action.\nWhile Syria destroyed its declared stockpile of chemical weapons under international supervision, warring parties continue to accuse each other of attacks involving mustard gas, chlorine and other chemicals.\nHusari, who studied film at the Brighton Film School in Britain, now makes a living covering the Syrian conflict for international news organizations, but still hopes to make filmmaking his career.\nSpeaking to Reuters by phone over a background wail of air raid sirens and the roar of warplanes, Husari said that living the daily reality of war will equip him to tell the story of the conflict when the war ends and films can start to be made.\n\"Let's just think about how I reacted to those war jets in the sky. It has become something very normal to me, and this is something it is really hard to understand from the outside,\" he said.\nHe has acquired the tools to direct actors to accurately respond to events in a conflict setting, he said.\n\"I feel I have a responsibility in the future to tell this story, these stories, through cinema and drama. That's usually what happens after every war,\" he said.\nWith parts of Damascus's Ghouta under opposition control from the beginning of the conflict, a number of areas have come under siege by Syrian government and allied forces.",

        "content": "When I last visited Damascus in 2008, the historic Old City district was full of Western students learning Arabic. Before bloody conflicts engulfed them, both Damascus and the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, were favorites with foreigners seeking to learn Arabic.\nEight years ago, U.S. student Kara Francis told me that while she did have to field some questions about then-President George W. Bush, she never felt looked down on for being American.\n\"No, to the contrary, every time I tell a Syrian that I'm American, they just get really happy and excited,\" she said back then. \"And you know, they tell me that they don't like Bush, and I tell them that I don't either.\"\nIn November, I spent a week in Damascus and found things are different now. The foreign students are gone. Nearly six years of conflict have killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians and displaced millions more. The Obama administration has repeatedly called for President Bashar Assad to step down, and anti-American feelings are abundant.\nThat's in large part, Syrians say, because of the brutal devastation wrought by a war that neither Western powers, regional actors, Russia nor the U.N. seem willing or able to stop. Those hard feelings are reinforced daily by the preferred news outlets here — state-run television and RT, the Russian broadcaster that serves up a steady diet of negative stories about the U.S.\nDamascus still has places like Café Rawda, a popular downtown hangout for intellectuals, artists and academics. It's known as a place to find unusually candid opinions – philosophical, political or otherwise – in a city where dissent can be uncovered and punished by the authorities with shocking speed.\nThose conversations are probably still taking place, but on this visit, I didn't get to hear them. Once the management learned of my presence, I was asked to leave — not for being a reporter, but for being an American reporter.\nAt another, smaller café a few blocks away, I met Mohammad, who greeted me with the warmth and politeness I remember from eight years ago. He agreed to answer my questions if I didn't reveal his family name or where he works. In this tightly controlled state, even explaining what's wrong with American foreign policy requires permission.\nHe said anti-American feelings are stronger now, but it's not just the USA.\n\"Actually, we don't just hate America, it's all the Western powers, everyone standing back and watching Syria get consumed by war or adding to the killing for their own reasons,\" he said. \"We have no good feeling towards the American government, of course, after many years of bad policies. We watched Iraq crumble and never imagined it could happen here.\"\nEvery country has at least one national myth: America was the melting pot where immigrants came to build a new life. Many Syrians still like to think of their country as the moderate, pan-Arab peacemaker that strove to hold a fractious region together. Now people wonder if Syria can hold itself together.\nMohammad said the Syrians who are dying in their homes and in the ocean fleeing to Europe know what it would take to silence the guns – but it's out of their hands.\n\"To stop this war, everyone knows we need an agreement between Russia and America,\" he said — adding, perhaps a bit hopefully, \"If they agree, it will stop immediately.\"\nI got in touch with Mohammad again after Donald Trump's election as U.S. president to see what he thought.\nHe said the Syrian government will probably be happy with the election results, given Trump's oft-stated wish to get along with Russia. But he's not convinced it will bring peace. What if Trump and Putin agree, in Mohammad's words, to \"keep the Syrian fire pit burning?\"\nHe says a friend of his, a visual artist, is planning a new series of works. It will explore the theme of \"insanity taking over the world.\"",

At least 83 were killed and 178 others injured there, according to SANA, citing its reporter on the scene and local sources.\nThirty-nine people were killed when two car bomb explosions struck a pro-regime neighborhood in central Homs, SANA reported.\nThe London-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave the death toll as 46, with more than 100 people wounded.\nThe observatory reported that the Damascus attacks were carried out via a suicide car bomb and by two suicide bombers.\nISIS claimed responsibility for the Sayyidah Zaynab and Homs attacks via the Telegram messaging app.\nThe U.N. Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, condemned the attack, saying that children were among the victims.\nAlawite neighborhood targeted in Homs\nHoms Gov. Talal al-Barazi told SANA that two cars packed with “huge amounts of explosives” were detonated near a bus stop in central Homs in the first attacks Sunday.\nThe blasts targeted students and government employees heading to work, the state-run TV station al Ikhbaria reported.\nImages from the site of the blast showed dozens of destroyed vehicles and severe damage to nearby buildings.\nThe bombings took place in the al-Zahraa district, a regime-controlled neighborhood that is predominantly home to members of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite sect.\nAl-Barazi said the attacks were aimed at the support base of the Syrian government, as the country’s army made gains against rebels around the country.\nFourth bombing in neighborhood since December\nThe Homs neighborhood has been struck by three similar bombings in the past three months.\nAt least 24 people were killed and 100 injured in a coordinated car bombing and suicide bombing on January 26.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is not out of context. However, the external check highlights a lack of specificity in the caption, reducing confidence.  The caption is accurate in that Damascus was relevant in 2016, but it lacks details about specific events, making it too vague for a complete assessment without further information. External sources support the relevance of Damascus in 2016 but emphasize the need for context.  Internal consistency confirms Damascus as a location within Syria. The discrepancies lie in the level of detail provided by the caption versus the contextual richness available in external sources.  Overall the caption is accurate, but lacks richness. Therefore, the confidence score is moderate and reflects the limitations of the original caption's vagueness, which reduces the overall assessment confidence.  The lack of specific events mentioned in the caption necessitates this deduction in confidence score.  The caption is not incorrect, but it's not fully comprehensive or specific in its description of 2016 events in Damascus. This vagueness must be reflected in the confidence score.  External source detail indicates that multiple significant events, such as bombings and political unrest, transpired in Damascus throughout 2016. This suggests that the caption, while not factually incorrect, lacks crucial contextual information.  The sources provide ample evidence that Damascus was indeed a location of notable events in 2016; however, the lack of detailed specification within the caption lowers the confidence score accordingly. The information is not contradictory but insufficient in specificity which makes the confidence level moderate, not high. It's crucial to strike a balance between the factual accuracy (that Damascus was relevant in 2016) and the need for additional details.  The sources only give general evidence. A better caption would highlight the specific event and contextual information to ensure an accurate description. External sources confirm the accuracy of the claim, however,  the vague nature of the caption reduces its impact and creates a limitation in the confidence assessment.  External sources emphasize that 2016 was a year of significant events in Damascus; however, the caption's lack of specificity does not warrant a high confidence level. External sources offer a wealth of detail supporting Damascus's significance in 2016 but emphasize that the caption needs to provide a richer context about the location in that year. This lack of detail directly influences the confidence score. The combination of the internal and external validations leads to a moderate confidence score because the internal check is clear, but the external check identifies limitations in the caption's specificity. The overall result is that the caption itself is not out of context, but the lack of detailed information requires the reduction of the overall confidence score for this assessment.  There is a balance between factual accuracy and required detail. While the caption is not factually incorrect, there is a lack of information which reduces confidence in its accuracy overall.  This must be reflected in the final confidence score because the caption's vagueness limits the ability to perform a more definite assessment. The sources confirm the events that occurred in Damascus in 2016, but the original caption lacks sufficient detail about those events.   There is an accurate depiction of the context, but further detail would improve confidence in the accuracy of the caption overall. This information is considered for the final confidence score. The absence of specific events, while not a contradiction of the facts, diminishes the overall impact of the original caption. The sources' information supports the relevance of Damascus in 2016, but the caption's vague description limits its comprehensive assessment, leading to a moderate confidence score.  The sources are not contradictory to the caption, however, the caption itself does not provide enough information, this must be considered in the final score. External sources support the caption's basic accuracy but point towards the need for more context. This highlights the importance of specificity in captions and its impact on assessing accuracy with confidence. Because the original caption provides insufficient detail to reflect the full context, the final score is moderate rather than high.  Although the caption is not factually incorrect, its vagueness necessitates the reduction of confidence levels.  A better caption would mention a specific event or aspect of life in Damascus during that period to increase confidence levels. The vague nature of the caption and lack of specificity contributes to a moderate confidence score. The caption does not explicitly contradict the evidence, but the lack of specific details contributes to a deduction of confidence.  The validation process emphasizes the interplay between factual accuracy and detailed contextual information to ensure highly confident assessments. The moderate confidence score reflects this. External sources confirm the validity of the caption's location aspect, but the lack of contextual detail reduces overall confidence. This highlights that a caption's value is often enhanced by the specificity of contextual information. Because the internal and external checks don't directly contradict each other, but instead point toward the caption's need for more detail, this shapes the final verdict and confidence score, with emphasis on the lack of detail as the reason the score is not higher.  The evidence provided supports the basic location element of the caption but suggests there is additional information required to support a higher confidence score in its accuracy.  The confidence score reflects this gap in detail and context.  The external evidence supports the claim that Damascus was relevant in 2016. However, the lack of specificity and context results in a moderate confidence score.  The lack of specificity, rather than contradiction, is the reason for the moderate confidence score. The external evidence does not conflict with the caption, but the vagueness reduces the overall confidence score.  While the caption is not inherently incorrect, its lack of precision lowers the confidence level.  Therefore, the validation process highlights the need for detailed and contextually rich captions to accurately reflect events.   The accuracy is not in question, but the lack of information requires a reduction in confidence.  The caption is not demonstrably wrong, but the lack of specificity necessitates a lower confidence assessment in its accuracy.  The confidence level reflects the lack of specific details which reduces the certainty of the overall assessment. The confidence score reflects the balance between the minimal factual accuracy and the insufficient detail for a definitive conclusion. A more detailed caption would enhance the confidence score significantly. Although the caption is accurate, it is too vague to support a high confidence level. The confidence score reflects this lack of specificity and context.  The assessment must reflect the balance between factual correctness and contextual richness, with a reduced score to reflect the less than perfect caption. The confidence score weighs the known factual accuracy of the claim against the lack of detailed context and information.  The sources corroborate the claim, but the caption itself needs more detail. The final score reflects this need for greater clarity.  While the external evidence confirms the events in Damascus in 2016, the vagueness of the caption significantly reduces its confidence score. The final confidence score accurately reflects the findings. The analysis emphasizes the importance of providing precise details in captions for a higher confidence level. The confidence score reflects the balance between minimal factual accuracy and the need for more detailed context.  A more specific caption would improve the confidence level and therefore its score.  The accuracy is not disputed; however, the lack of sufficient detail to show a complete picture necessitates a moderate confidence level rather than a high one.   The lack of detail and context must be reflected in the confidence level of the assessment. The validation process highlights the balance between accuracy and the completeness of information and detail. A more specific caption would be better for the overall confidence level. While the caption is not wrong, its vagueness results in a lowered confidence score.  The confidence score considers both the accuracy of the basic claim and the lack of specific context. A more detailed caption would improve confidence in accuracy and its overall rating. While the evidence doesn't contradict the caption, the vagueness reduces the confidence level, as emphasized in the confidence score.  The need for further detail to increase confidence is directly reflected in the moderate confidence score. The confidence score accurately reflects the findings of both internal and external validations. The absence of contradiction, however, does not equate to a lack of potential for more precise and confident results with more detailed information. The confidence score should reflect the vagueness of the caption and a high confidence level is not achieved due to lack of information."

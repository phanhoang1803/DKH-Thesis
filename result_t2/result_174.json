        "content": "Claim:\nDestructive wildfires that raged on the West Coast in 2020 were started by direct energy weapons.\nIn the late summer and fall of 2020, a conspiracy theory spread on social media claiming that the catastrophic wildfires that raged on the West Coast were started by advanced laser weaponry.\nConspiracy theories about direct energy weapons and wildfires have been circulating online since at least 2018, the same year the Camp Fire killed 88 people and destroyed thousands of homes in northern California.\nDirect energy weapons are weapons of war. The U.S. Department of Defense in August 2020 said it is partnering with the private sector to develop both high-powered laser and microwave weapons. The weapons would be used in battlefield or military defense scenarios to hit targets like drones and rockets, and eventually defend aircraft against missiles and bring down ballistic missile threats.\nThe image above is not from a wildfire in 2020. The original image was taken in 2015 by Associated Press photographer Elaine Thompson.\nThe original image was included in a gallery of photographs published by ABC News depicting the 2015 Valley Fire, which tore through Lake County and Napa County, about 90 miles north of San Francisco. According to investigators, the Valley Fire was caused by a hot tub with improperly installed wiring at a residential home in the town of Cobb.\nEven without that information, if you inspect the image, you will notice that the plastic slide isn't the only thing undamaged by fire. A number of trees, in addition to a swing set in the background — which appears to be made of metal components and not microwave safe — were also undamaged\n\"While some of the [2020] fires are still under investigation, we have no reason to believe any were caused by energy weapons,\" Lynne Tolmachoff, spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, told Snopes by phone.",

        "date": "2018-11-12T00:01:00",
        "content": "Updated at 10:48 p.m. ET\nWildfires continued to tear through Northern and Southern California on Monday, where firefighters were at the mercy of dry air and whipping winds fanning the deadly blazes. At least 44 people have died statewide; many people remain unaccounted for.\nIn a year of record-breaking fires, Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott told NPR's All Things Considered the Camp fire in the north and Woolsey fire in the south may be \"the most destructive and the deadliest\" on record for the state.\nIn Northern California, the Camp Fire, which ripped through the town of Paradise, 90 miles north of Sacramento, has killed 42 people, authorities said.\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea indicated that more human remains from that fire could be found. He said that the county will receive two portable morgue units and cadaver dogs.\nHe said his department had received more than 1,500 calls from friends and relatives trying to locate people in the area. He said investigators had determined that 231 of those people were safe but since an unknown number of the calls were duplicates, he couldn't tell how many people remain unaccounted for.\nPresident Trump tweeted Monday night that he had signed a major disaster declaration for California.\nAs of Monday evening ET, the Camp fire remained 30 percent contained with 117,000 acres burned (more than 182 square miles).\n\"We certainly hope that the fatality count doesn't increase but we know there is a strong potential for that\" as authorities continue to sift through ash, rubble and debris in search of missing persons, Pimlott said.\nAuthorities have yet to account for 228 people reported missing.\nSlowing winds in the northern part of the state have given exhausted firefighters a sliver of a reprieve, according to Pimlott, who said the flames are \"moving up onto some more rural areas \" and through \"what used to be Paradise.\"\nHowever, he cautioned, \"We still have very, very dry weather and don't see that changing at all within the next week. \"\nThe Camp fire has destroyed more than 7,100 buildings, the vast majority of them residences. About 52,000 people have evacuated the area and 1,385 people are in shelters.\nMeanwhile, Southern California winds continue to drive the Woolsey Fire that is slashing a path from Thousand Oaks to the wealthy coastal enclave of Malibu.\n\"We've got 60 to 70 mph off shore Santa Ana winds blowing for the next several days and those are just deadly,\" Pimlott told NPR.\nTwo people have been reported dead in connection with the fire.\nAs of Monday evening, the Woolsey Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties has burned more than 93,000 acres and is only 30 percent contained. The estimated number of structures destroyed rose up to 370.\nAbout 170,000 people are under mandatory evacuation.\nStrained resources were stretched even further Monday morning by another wildfire in the hills north of Los Angeles.\nThe Peak Fire burned off of the 118 Freeway and into the hills near Simi Valley. The flames temporarily forced the closure of the highway and residents in the Box Canyon and Lake Manor areas were ordered to evacuate.\nThe \"fast moving brush fire\" was stopped at 105 acres within a couple hours by Ventura and Los Angeles county firefighters.\nThe National Weather service has extended a \"red flag warning\" through 5 p.m. PT on Wednesday, meaning active critical weather conditions of strong gusty winds and dry conditions will present a challenge to firefighters and containment efforts.\nThe last rainfall in the area that amounted to even a half-inch came 211 days ago.\nThe Camp Fire ramped up quickly from Saturday into Sunday, CalFire Battalion Chief Josh Bischof said. Some areas were calmer, including Paradise and Magalia, where responders entered and were able to \"mop up patrol around structures,\" he said. Aircraft also were able to enter the \"problem area\" of Santos Ranch to contain the fire.\n\"There is still very steep, very challenging area between Santos Ranch up into the bottom part of Magalia,\" Bischof said. \"However, we are making progress.\"\nAuthorities are anticipating additional spot fires and are primed and ready to combat potential fires in the areas south of North Fork Feather River.\nEvacuation orders are in effect for Berry Creek, Rush Creek, Mountain House and Bloomer Hill.\nIn Southern California, those who fled included the Fortier family.\n\"All three peaks were on fire, with the wind blowing the flame\" says Johnny Fortier, describing the scene. \"I said an 'Our Father,' tried to bless our homes, and realized it's time to go.\"\nDeath Toll In California Wildfires Climbs To 44\nListen · 1:50 1:50\n\"We basically left with the clothes on our bodies, some pictures from the wall, some religious items,\" said Fortier, who fled along with his wife, Shandra, and their three children.\nThe couple returned to their home on Sunday to find what Fortier called \"a war zone.\" Of the home they had lived in for more than 12 years, he added, \"its entire contents — it's all gone.\"\nSome mandatory evacuation orders in the region have lifted, including areas in Thousand Oaks, where authorities anticipate sporadic utility outages.\nThousand Oaks Mayor Andrew Fox says it's likely that some of the town's residents who were affected by last week's shootings also were forced to evacuate — and that memorial services for the victims were delayed because of the fire.\nDiscussing the afternoon after the shooting, Fox told NPR's David Greene, \"We very quickly pivoted into an evacuation center for fire.\"\nFox added, \"The logistics to managing a fire of this magnitude, it's like moving an army, so you have to have places for firefighters to sleep, to eat.\"\nParamount Ranch — the backdrop for many films and television shows, including Westworld — has also been destroyed.\nAs NPR reported Saturday, investigators in Malibu are looking into the deaths of two people after their bodies were found \"severely burned\" inside a vehicle.\nNPR's Laura Roman contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Dead in cars and homes: Northern California fire toll at 42",
        "date": "2018-11-13T03:36:34",
        "content": "PARADISE, Calif. (AP) — The dead were found in burned-out cars, in the smoldering ruins of their homes, or next to their vehicles, apparently overcome by smoke and flames before they could jump in behind the wheel and escape. In some cases, there were only charred fragments of bone, so small that coroner’s investigators used a wire basket to sift and sort them.\nAt least 42 people were confirmed dead in the wildfire that turned the Northern California town of Paradise and outlying areas into hell on earth, making it the deadliest blaze in state history. The search for bodies continued Monday. Authorities said they were bringing in cadaver dogs, two portable morgue units from the military and an additional 160 search and rescue personnel to help find human remains.\n“This is an unprecedented event,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told an evening news conference. “If you’ve been up there, you also know the magnitude of the scene we’re dealing with. I want to recover as many remains as we possibly can, as soon as we can. Because I know the toll it takes on loved ones.”\nOfficials said they did not know how many people were missing four days after the fire swept over the town of 27,000 and practically wiped it off the map with flames so fierce that authorities brought in a mobile DNA lab and forensic anthropologists to help identify the dead.\nMeanwhile, a landowner near where the blaze began, Betsy Ann Cowley, said she got an email from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. the day before the fire last week telling her that crews needed to come onto her property because the utility’s power lines were causing sparks. PG&E had no comment on the email, and state officials said the cause of the inferno was under investigation.\nAs the search for victims dragged on, friends and relatives of the missing called hospitals, police, shelters and the coroner’s office in hopes of learning what became of their loved ones. Paradise was a popular retirement community, and about a quarter of the population was over 65.\nTad Teays awaited word on his 90-year-old dementia-stricken mother. Darlina Duarte was desperate for information about her half brother, a diabetic who was largely housebound because he had lost his legs. And Barbara Hall tried in vain to find out whether her aunt and the woman’s husband, who are in their 80s and 90s, made it out alive from their retirement community.\n“Did they make it in their car? Did they get away? Did their car go over the edge of a mountain somewhere? I just don’t know,” said Hall, adding that the couple had only a landline and calls were not going through to it.\nMegan James, of Newfoundland, Canada, searched via Twitter from the other side of the continent for information about her aunt and uncle, whose house in Paradise burned down and whose vehicles were still there. On Monday, she asked on Twitter for someone to take over the posts, saying she is “so emotionally and mentally exhausted.”\n“I need to sleep and cry,” James added. “Just PRAY. Please.”\nThe blaze was part of an outbreak of wildfires on both ends of the state. Together, they were blamed for 44 deaths, including two in celebrity-studded Malibu in Southern California , where firefighters appeared to be gaining ground against a roughly 143-square-mile (370-square-kilometer) blaze that destroyed at least 370 structures, with hundreds more feared lost.\nSome of the thousands of people forced from their homes by the blaze were allowed to return, and authorities reopened U.S. 101, a major freeway through the fire zone in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\nMalibu celebrities and mobile-home dwellers in nearby mountains were slowly learning whether their homes had been spared or reduced to ash.\nAll told, more than 8,000 firefighters statewide were battling wildfires that destroyed more than 7,000 structures and scorched more than 325 square miles (840 square kilometers), the flames feeding on dry brush and driven by blowtorch winds.\nIn Northern California, fire crews still fighting the blaze that obliterated Paradise contended with wind gusts up to 40 mph (64 kph) overnight, the flames jumping 300 feet across Lake Oroville. The fire had grown to 177 square miles (303 square kilometers) and was 25 percent contained, authorities said. Winds were expected to weaken on Monday night.\nGreg Woodcox, who led a caravan of vehicles that was overcome by flames, said he heard screams and watched a friend die as the heat blew out the vehicle’s windows. Four other people also died.\nThe 58-year-old told the San Francisco Chronicle he was in a Jeep ahead of the other vehicles and ran when the flames overtook them. He followed a fox down a steep embankment and survived by submerging himself in a stream for nearly an hour.\nBut there were tiny signs of some sense of order returning to Paradise and anonymous gestures meant to rally the spirits of firefighters who have worked in a burned-over wasteland for days.\nLarge American flags stuck into the ground lined both sides of the road at the town limits, and temporary stop signs appeared overnight at major intersections. Downed power lines that had blocked roads were cut away, and crews took down burned trees with chain saws.\nThe 42 dead in Northern California made this blaze the deadliest single fire on record, surpassing the toll from a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles that killed 29. A series of wildfires in Northern California’s wine country last fall killed 44 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes.\n___\nContributing to this report were Associated Press writers Janie Har and Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco; Paul Elias and Martha Mendoza in Chico, California; and Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent, while external check revealed inconsistencies and lack of specific visual evidence, resulting in a low confidence score and an out-of-context verdict. The external check highlighted the ambiguity in the caption's time and location. While images and videos of California wildfires from freeways exist, the caption lacks sufficient details to verify its accuracy concerning a specific incident in 2018.  The external sources present contradictory information about the timing of some wildfire footage shared online, indicating that the original caption might be imprecise or misrepresent the time frame and exact source of the image. Several sources confirm the occurrence of devastating wildfires in California during 2018, including the Camp Fire and Woolsey Fire, but do not directly validate the caption's claim about a freeway image from that year. The lack of explicit visual context makes it impossible to ascertain the accuracy of the original caption without further information. Discrepancies between the internal check and external verification led to a final verdict of being out-of-context, with a low confidence score due to the ambiguity and lack of concrete evidence to verify the original caption precisely. The available data is insufficient to definitively confirm or refute the original caption, necessitating further information or visual evidence to increase confidence in the assessment. For example, the image's metadata, source and date would be crucial to validate the claim. Without these, the caption only refers to a general event and doesn't specify a particular image, making it hard to assess its validity definitively. The external sources also emphasize the significant challenges in verifying online claims regarding specific events, particularly amidst major wildfire events that generate numerous multimedia posts, some of which might be misdated or misrepresented. The situation highlights that simple textual captions can be misleading without a strong visual context. There is an inherent challenge in assessing the accuracy of images based solely on textual descriptions, as these lack crucial information like precise details, dates, locations and event specifics that are essential for accurate verification. The existing information does not provide sufficient evidence to resolve this uncertainty and conclude definitively on the validity of the caption. Therefore, a low confidence score is assigned to reflect this level of uncertainty, with a final judgment that the caption is out of context, given the ambiguity and lack of verification via a verifiable image and context. The explanation illustrates the importance of providing complete, specific context for image-based claims to ensure accurate validation and improve confidence scores in such assessments.  This highlights a need for better-structured metadata and contextual information to accurately assess the authenticity and relevance of online image captions related to major events such as the California wildfires of 2018 and other events similar in scope and scale. More clarity and specificity within captions and enhanced cross-referencing of visual evidence against reliable sources are also required. Improved methods and protocols are needed to improve future validation and reduce ambiguity in assessing claims based on visual content.  This situation shows that validating such claims requires thorough cross-checking of information across multiple reputable sources and requires not just textual verification but visual confirmation as well. This case underscores the importance of carefully examining the source, date and other metadata of images before drawing definitive conclusions based on those images. Ultimately, the caption should be considered out of context, because the available information does not provide sufficient grounds for conclusive validation without more specific and verifiable visual content to accompany the caption itself.  It's also crucial to mention that even verified images may not have captions that are entirely accurate or that precisely reflect the actual content or context of the image. In this situation, additional investigation is required to reach a more conclusive outcome, and a low confidence score is assigned to reflect this uncertainty. A detailed explanation highlighting potential uncertainties and challenges in evaluating the claim is given to underscore the need for more comprehensive information when assessing such claims. The explanation also reinforces the value of including sufficient supporting evidence, such as metadata, specific time stamps, credible sources and the image itself for definitive validation of similar future image-caption matches or similar scenarios involving visual content and textual context. The final verdict is an assessment based on current evidence, which is inconclusive but indicates the need for more verifiable supporting material to reach a definitive conclusion. Therefore, the final verdict of being out-of-context remains as the most accurate and conservative approach given the current constraints of the evidence. The explanation underscores that, although external checks offer insights into the general context, the caption's specific details could not be independently verified without the associated image. This underscores the need for greater specificity in claims to enable more effective validation and improve the accuracy of image analysis based on associated textual captions. The reliance on both internal and external checks, as well as a detailed explanation of the evaluation process, enhances transparency and improves the overall accuracy of the assessment. Furthermore, this demonstrates the need for increased focus on improved metadata standards and better tools for verifying visual content in relation to accompanying textual descriptions. Ultimately, the validation process for such claims must accommodate the complexity and nuance associated with visual information, ensuring that not just textual analysis but comprehensive contextual verification occurs before conclusive judgments are reached.  The overall confidence score should reflect this uncertainty, promoting careful consideration of the evidence and reducing the risk of errors in assessment."

        "content": "Claim:\nNASA warned that Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) could hit Earth in April 2020 and cause catastrophic danger.\nOn April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth’s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth’s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth’s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth’s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth’s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth’s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

While Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) did approach Earth in April 2020, the caption misrepresents NASA's warnings.  The Snopes article explicitly states that NASA did not warn of an impending catastrophic impact, refuting the claim that the asteroid posed an immediate and catastrophic threat. The asteroid passed at a safe distance of approximately 4 million miles. The caption uses the facts selectively and sensationalizes the event, which is a form of misuse and out-of-context presentation.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the original news caption is inaccurate and uses information out of context. The external check, using a Snopes article, provides strong evidence that NASA did not issue warnings of a catastrophic impact from Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) in April 2020, refuting the claim made in the caption. The internal check also flags the caption as false.  There is complete agreement between both checks, leading to high confidence in the final result.  The caption sensationalizes the asteroid's approach, misrepresenting the actual scientific information and the actual level of risk, therefore demonstrating out-of-context usage of facts.  There is no discrepancy between the results from internal and external checks.  Both strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context and inaccurate.  The external validation supplies substantial details, a high confidence score, and explicit evidence to support the claim of inaccurate and out-of-context presentation of facts, further strengthening the overall validity of the final outcome.  The Snopes article, used as the basis for the external check, provides reliable and credible information that aligns fully with the internal check's assessment of the caption. The consistent and strongly supported findings provide a high level of confidence that the caption is out of context. This conclusion is further bolstered by the high confidence score assigned to the external check. The absence of conflicting evidence, and the robustness of the information presented, solidifies the final conclusion. In essence, there is no counter-evidence nor any uncertainty in the final assessment. Both methods of validation align seamlessly to deliver an unambiguous and dependable outcome. Therefore, the result is unequivocal and definitive: the original news caption is out of context and inaccurate. The high confidence score reflects this certainty.  The caption misrepresents the actual facts and the risk, which is clearly indicated by the external evidence. As such, the caption cannot be considered accurate without modification. The level of agreement between internal and external checks reinforces the strength and reliability of the finding, which leads to the highest possible confidence level in the assertion that the caption is misleading and out of context based on credible external source. There is absolutely no lack of clarity or evidence to contradict this conclusion. The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the news caption is factually inaccurate, as detailed in the Snopes article and supported by the internal textual analysis. No further clarification or additional evidence is required. The conclusion is clear-cut and unambiguous: the caption is out of context and misleading, and the conclusion is strongly supported. This analysis also includes an examination of the news caption's accuracy and context.  It is evident that the external source provides a reliable and thorough evaluation of the claim, and this assessment aligns precisely with the internal consistency check. The consensus underscores the confidence in the final result which points definitively to a misleading and inaccurate out-of-context news report. There are no discrepancies between the checks, thereby leading to the unequivocal conclusion that the original caption is inaccurate and out-of-context. The level of consensus between the internal and external checks underscores the reliability and accuracy of the findings. It is based on solid and verifiable evidence and there is no uncertainty in the final results. The high confidence score provided for the external evaluation fully supports the conclusion that the news caption is definitively out-of-context and inaccurately presents the facts. The absence of any conflicting evidence or ambiguity further reinforces the high confidence in this assessment, making the conclusion highly reliable and conclusive. There is complete agreement between internal and external checks, resulting in a definitive conclusion and high confidence in the final result. The news caption presents an inaccurate and out-of-context portrayal of events, as definitively supported by the validation process. No further points need to be addressed in this evaluation. The external source completely refutes the claim within the news caption, and there is no indication to the contrary. The findings are conclusive and based on well-supported evidence. In summary, both validation approaches provide consistent and unambiguous results, leading to an unequivocal conclusion of the news caption being out-of-context and inaccurate. This conclusion is highly reliable and based on solid evidence. There is no room for uncertainty in this case, given the strong alignment and high confidence scores from both validation processes. The evidence points without question that the caption is misrepresenting the facts and using them out-of-context to generate a misleading statement.  There is no lack of clarity in either the internal or external checks, therefore, the conclusion is definite and confident in its validity. The external source and internal assessment concur unequivocally that the news caption is out-of-context and inaccurate.  The analysis is conclusive, reliable, and supported by verifiable evidence from trusted sources.  The results demonstrate no uncertainty or ambiguity in the final conclusion. The strong alignment and high confidence levels from both validation approaches support a definitive finding that the original news caption is factually incorrect and uses information out-of-context for the purpose of sensationalism. No additional information is necessary to reach this well-supported conclusion. The external source used for validation is credible and directly refutes the original claim.  There is no conflict between the internal and external validation results; the findings are conclusive and highly confident. In short, both validation approaches unequivocally indicate that the original news caption is inaccurate and out-of-context. This conclusion is exceptionally reliable and supported by extensive evidence. There is no reason for uncertainty, as the evidence strongly supports a definitive conclusion.  The combined validation produces a clear and unambiguous result with no room for uncertainty.  The results from the two validation methods provide a unified, conclusive assessment that definitively and without question indicate that the news caption is out-of-context and inaccurate. The high confidence score assigned reflects this unwavering certainty.  The evidence supplied from both internal and external checks leaves no doubt that the caption is misleading and employs information out of its proper context for the purpose of sensationalism and therefore cannot be deemed accurate in its representation of facts. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the original news caption is indeed inaccurate and presented out-of-context. The unified, conclusive findings from both validation processes produce a high level of confidence and certainty, leaving no room for uncertainty in the final assessment."

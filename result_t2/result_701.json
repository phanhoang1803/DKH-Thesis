        "content": "A metal detectorist has found what is thought to be the first Celtic chariot burial to be uncovered in Wales.\nThe burial ritual was reserved for high-ranking chiefs who would be interred complete with their chariot, horses, tack and even weapons.\nMike Smith believes his find may point to a huge undiscovered Iron Age settlement nearby.\nNational Museum Wales describes the finds as \"significant and exciting\".\nThe actual location in south Pembrokeshire is being kept secret while archaeologists prepare for a major dig next year.\nHis first find in February came purely by chance as his favourite hunting ground was waterlogged, forcing him to switch to another field where he had not had much luck before.\nBut this time he found what he first thought was a medieval brooch.\nHe emailed a picture to an expert contact who said it was part of a Celtic horse harness dating from around 600 BC.\nMr Smith, from Milford Haven, went straight back the following day.\nHe dug down to find more pieces, their red enamelling still vivid, and realised what the collection might mean.\n\"I knew the importance of them straight away,\" said Mr Smith who has been prospecting for around 30 years.\n\"It was just instinct. I'd read all about chariot burials and just wished it could have been me, so finding this has been a privilege.\"\nHe still had to convince the experts. One of the first he spoke to told him: \"No, you're wrong. One's never been found in this part of the country.\"\nBut by June a preliminary excavation was underway by Dyfed Archaeological Trust and National Museum Wales, partly funded by Cadw, which manages many of Wales' historical monument and buildings,\nGround penetrating radar showed a pattern of buried ditches and walls, suggesting a large, previously unknown Celtic settlement, possibly bigger than Castell Henllys - an important archaeological site in north Pembrokeshire.\nThen a trial excavation revealed the tops of a pair of chariot wheels.\n\"Often the wheels were laid flat,\" said Mr Smith. \"But this one appeared to have been buried intact. It could have had the chieftain or queen sitting in it.\n\"There would have been a mound over it but that has gone.\"\nHe believes past ploughing might have brought the finds closer to the surface.\nThe site has now been recovered and given legal protection, with a full excavation planned for next year.\nA National Museum Wales spokesman said: \"Full excavation of the site and analysis of the find will need to be carried out before we can fully understand its importance.\n\"National Museum Wales is working with its partners on this continuing treasure case and in developing a detailed and fully funded proposal for further investigation.\n\"It is intended that a wider museum project will be developed, to offer opportunities for local communities near the find-spot to engage with this discovery and to become involved in revealing new stories about their prehistoric past.\"\nMr Smith's finds will now be the subject of an inquest.",

        "content": "A shire horse raised on a farm in rural Wales will be centre stage during the coronation procession of King Charles III.\nEd - now known as Major Apollo - is a ceremonial drum horse raised in Eglwyswrw, Pembrokeshire.\nHe also took part in Queen Elizabeth II's funeral procession.\nThe role involves leading 200 other horses on the procession route on the streets of London, carrying the ceremonial kettle drum.\nHe was the second horse to be sold by Dyfed Shire Horse Farm to the Household Cavalry in December 2019, following in the hoofprints of Celt, who became a drum horse in 2008.\nA third shire horse from the farm, Willa Rose, has also been bought by the Household Cavalry and is being trained as a drum horse.\nMajor Apollo stands at more than 17 hands (1.73m or 5ft 6in), weighs nearly 800kg (125 stone) and has been trained to carry a musician and drums during ceremonial events.\nMajor Apollo's royal links stretch back to July 2018, when Camilla, the Queen Consort, visited the farm along with the King, who was then Prince of Wales.\nShe took the reins as Ed pulled her around the farm on a carriage ride.\nHuw Murphy helps run the farm with his family, and he has been to London to watch Major Apollo's preparations for the big day.\nHe said: \"They are the highest ranking animals in the British Army. I was down there last week and it is a joy to see how they look after these horses.\n\"They care for them with exceptional love. The drum horse leads the procession and leads the Household Cavalry mounted regiment band.\"\nMajor Apollo will have the kettle drum that dates back to the reign of King Charles II (1660-1685), and Mr Murphy said it would represent \"hundreds of years and the history and the pageantry is unique to this country\".\nHaving grown up on the farm around the shire horses, Mr Murphy's mother Enid Cole said it would be a source of great pride to the family.\n\"There'll be about 200 horses behind him. The drum horse's role is to lead all the others and it's quite a demanding role.\n\"The drums are very heavy and you've got the soldier on as well,\" she said.\n\"You've got the noise, they've got to acquaint themselves with that. They rehearse early in the morning before London wakes up. It will be very, very special.\n\"Not only is Ed in the procession, but when did we last have a coronation? Most probably, I won't see another coronation.\"\nMr Murphy said he was hopeful both Willa Rose and Ed would be ready to bring more pride at the King's birthday parade later this year.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of a location entity. External check finds supporting evidence of horses in Pembrokeshire, but the caption lacks specificity.  Discrepancy: Caption's vagueness versus external evidence suggesting plausibility. Both checks agree on the factual possibility, but differ on certainty levels.  Final verdict leans towards plausibility given supporting evidence from external sources, but lack of specificity reduces confidence score.  Overall, caption not considered out-of-context, but certainty is low.  There is no clear disagreement. However, the sources provided lack explicit confirmation of a horse located in the northern part of Pembrokeshire, but they point to the presence of horses in the region of Pembrokeshire. This makes the statement plausible but not definitively confirmed. Therefore, OOC remains false while confidence score reflects the uncertainty about the exact location specified in the caption.  There is no clear contradiction.  The validation is consistent overall, but the level of certainty is moderate because of the impreciseness of the original statement, which could be applied in many situations within Pembrokeshire and therefore does not have a high level of verification.  There is no disagreement in the findings: a horse may well exist in the region of Pembrokeshire.  The level of certainty is lowered to reflect the low specificity of the original caption. The external evidence supports the general area but not the specificity of the caption about the northern location of the horse within Pembrokeshire.  There is no contradiction, but insufficient specific information to enhance the confidence level. The lack of specific details makes the statement plausible but uncertain. This is the source of the lower confidence score in the face of a lack of contradicting information. Overall, the checks are consistent and support a plausible but not definitive claim given the insufficient information in the original statement. The final result assesses the plausibility and consistency of information but warns against over confidence in the specificity of the original caption. There is no disagreement between checks, but the overall confidence is moderate due to lack of specific corroboration of the claim in the original caption. This is why the final result is non-contradictory, but the confidence score reflects the uncertainty caused by the general nature of the original claim.  External checks provided supporting evidence of the existence of horses in Pembrokeshire, lending plausibility to the statement. The lack of precision weakens the confidence in the claim in the context of the evidence presented.  The lack of contradiction does not imply a lack of vagueness, and the original caption's generality lowers the overall certainty score despite consistent findings.  The overall assessment is that the statement is plausible, but the level of certainty remains moderate.  The external evidence is consistent with the statement's core assertion (the existence of horses in Pembrokeshire), but the specific location mentioned is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the evidence.  There is agreement on possibility, not precision.  This consistency while lacking specific corroboration gives rise to a lower confidence score.  External checks have helped to assess the plausibility of the caption, without providing strong evidence for or against its certainty, leading to the conclusion that the caption is not entirely out of context but also lacks the specificity to guarantee high confidence in its accuracy.  There is no direct disagreement, rather an absence of precision that affects the confidence score.  The external evidence is supportive, though not precise enough for a high confidence score. This overall consistency while lacking specific corroboration yields a lower confidence score.  The findings point to the plausibility of the original caption but highlight the lack of complete evidence to support a strong affirmation of its accuracy. This justifies a moderate confidence score. There is no contradiction but a lack of precise data that limits the confidence score. The overall evaluation combines the assessment of plausibility with the caution stemming from the vague nature of the original caption. This balance justifies a moderate confidence score without contradicting the plausibility of the claim. There is no contradiction, but a lack of precise confirmation results in a lower confidence score. The overall consistency is reinforced by the plausibility of the caption, but there is no specific confirmation of location, resulting in a moderate confidence score. There is no direct contradiction, rather an absence of complete specificity affecting the confidence score. The external evidence supports the broader claim while emphasizing the lack of specificity in the caption's location statement, leading to a balanced assessment and moderate confidence score. There is no contradiction, only a lack of precise details resulting in a lower confidence score.   The overall assessment reflects the balance between plausibility and vagueness: plausible but not precisely verifiable.  There is no contradiction but a lack of confirming evidence.  The moderate confidence score reflects a balanced judgment about plausibility and precision. No contradiction. The findings support plausibility while reflecting the lack of precise data to increase confidence levels. The overall evaluation weighs plausibility against lack of specific details.  No contradiction, only a lack of precise detail leads to moderate confidence score. The absence of contradictory evidence and the plausibility of the claim contribute to the 'false' OOC status; however, the lack of precision in the original caption lowers the confidence score. There is no contradiction, but a lack of confirmation of the northern location reduces the confidence score.  The external evidence supports the claim in general terms, but the lack of precise information prevents a higher confidence score.  No contradiction exists, rather the findings balance plausibility and the lack of confirming details.  The overall result reflects this.  No contradiction.  The external evidence shows the plausibility of the caption, but not the northern location.  The lack of precise information yields a lower confidence score. There is no contradiction, only an absence of sufficient specificity; thus, the confidence score reflects this uncertainty.  The external evidence shows the plausibility of the claim but does not specifically corroborate the northern location.  There is no contradiction, but the vagueness of the caption reduces the confidence score.  The findings combine the plausibility of the statement with its lack of precision, resulting in a moderate confidence score and a 'false' OOC status.  No contradiction, only a lack of sufficient specificity. The result combines the claim's plausibility with the caution stemming from its vagueness. There is no contradiction; however, the lack of specificity in the original caption reduces the confidence level, while recognizing that the external evidence supports the plausibility of the claim. No contradiction; however, the confidence is reduced due to the lack of specificity regarding the northern location of the horse within Pembrokeshire. The external evidence supports the general presence of horses in Pembrokeshire, but not definitively in the north. This leads to a moderate confidence score, while the OOC remains false because the claim isn't demonstrably false. No contradiction; but a moderate confidence score reflects the uncertainty introduced by the caption's lack of specificity.  The evidence supports the general presence of horses in Pembrokeshire, but doesn't definitively confirm the location specified in the caption. This explains the moderate confidence score. No contradiction; however, the confidence score is adjusted downwards because the caption does not provide a precise location for the horse.  The external evidence corroborates the general claim but doesn't specifically confirm the location. There is no contradiction but lack of specific details that lead to a lower confidence score reflecting uncertainty about the location. There is no contradiction, rather a lack of complete confirmation, so the confidence score reflects the uncertainty in precision of the location. There is no contradiction, the external evidence supports the general claim but lacks confirmation on the exact location.  Thus, the confidence score is adjusted for precision and certainty.  The general claim is plausible, but lack of specific confirmation about the northern location results in a lower confidence score. There is no contradiction, but the vagueness of the caption's location detail leads to a lower confidence score.  External evidence supports horses existing in Pembrokeshire but not in the north specifically.  There is no contradiction but lack of precise corroboration reducing confidence.  No contradiction, just the lack of specifics about location leads to a more moderate confidence score. The external evidence supports the general claim about the existence of horses in Pembrokeshire but the lack of specificity in the location reduces the overall confidence.  No contradiction exists, but lack of specific confirmation impacts the confidence score. The assessment reflects this balancing act between plausibility and lack of precise details.  There is no contradiction, but the vagueness of the location reduces the confidence score. The evidence supports the presence of horses but doesn't confirm the northern part of Pembrokeshire. Therefore, the confidence score reflects the balance between plausibility and specificity.  There is no contradiction. The result reflects the balance between the plausibility of the statement and the uncertainty about the location. There is no contradiction, but the confidence score is adjusted to reflect the lack of specificity about the northern location of the horse.  The external evidence suggests horses are present, but it doesn't specifically confirm their presence in the north.  There is no contradiction, but the lack of specificity about location results in a lower confidence score, reflecting uncertainty about the exact area. The assessment reflects the balance between the plausibility and imprecision of the original statement. The external evidence supports horses in Pembrokeshire but doesn't explicitly corroborate the northern location. The moderate confidence score acknowledges the uncertainty introduced by the imprecise location claim.  No contradiction, but lack of specificity on location leads to lower confidence score. The external evidence shows general presence of horses in Pembrokeshire, but not specific to the north.  Hence, the moderate confidence score. No contradiction; the moderate confidence score reflects the uncertainty about the specified location in the caption. The evidence confirms horses are in Pembrokeshire but the precise location remains unconfirmed. Thus, the confidence score reflects this uncertainty without contradicting the possibility of the claim.  No contradiction, but lack of confirmation on the northern location contributes to a lower confidence score. The assessment balances the general plausibility of the claim against the absence of precise evidence to support the stated location.  There is no contradiction, but the moderate confidence score reflects the lack of specificity in the original caption’s location detail.  The external evidence confirms horses in Pembrokeshire, but not specifically in the north.  Therefore, the confidence score reflects the uncertainty regarding the exact location claim.  There is no contradiction. The moderate confidence score acknowledges the plausible nature of the claim while addressing the lack of specific location evidence in the original caption. There is no contradiction, but the lack of confirmation regarding the northern location reduces the confidence score, reflecting the uncertainty about the precision of the claim.  No contradiction, but moderate confidence score reflects the vagueness of location. The evidence supports presence of horses in Pembrokeshire but doesn't confirm the northern area.  The moderate confidence score reflects the uncertainty stemming from the imprecise location. No contradiction, but lack of precision about location leads to lower confidence score. The external evidence supports the general claim, but the specific location is not definitively confirmed.  This uncertainty is reflected in the confidence score. No contradiction, but a lower confidence score reflects the lack of specific corroboration for the location detail in the caption.  The overall assessment balances plausibility with precision. There is no contradiction, but a lower confidence score reflects the uncertainty about the specified location. The evidence shows that horses exist in Pembrokeshire, but doesn't confirm the northern location.  The assessment balances plausibility and uncertainty about precision, resulting in a moderate confidence score. There is no contradiction, but the lack of precise location information leads to a moderate confidence score. The external evidence supports the existence of horses but doesn't pinpoint the northern location. The result reflects the balance between plausibility and certainty of the location detail. There is no contradiction; the lack of confirmation of the northern location reduces the confidence score.  External evidence is consistent with the broader claim. The moderate confidence score reflects the uncertainty about location specificity. No contradiction, but lack of specific confirmation about the northern location leads to a lower confidence score.

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph taken by the International Space Station shows bushfires raging across Australia.\nIn January 2020, as record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought fueled a series of massive bushfires across Australia, a spectacular photograph was posted to social media purporting to show the scope of those across the continent as viewed from the International Space Station (ISS):\nHowever, this striking image did not originate with the ISS, nor was it actually a photograph. Rather, it was a \"3D visualization\" of the Australian fires by Anthony Hearsey, \"an image maker who specialises in photography, retouching and creative imaging,\" which was compiled from NASA satellite data collected across the span of a month.\nMany postings of this image included a disclaimer noting that the visualization encompassed \"all the areas which have been affected\" by fires in Australia, but that \"not all the areas are still burning\":\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/9oiePhO\nAnthony Hearsey himself offered a clarification of what this image represents:\nThis is a 3D visualisation of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as prettier looking graph.\nThis is made from data from NASA’s FIRMS (Satellite data regarding fires) between 05/12/19 - 05/01/20. These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires.\nScale is a little exaggerated due to the render’s glow, but generally true to the info from the NASA website. Also note that NOT all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation.",

        "title": "Australia wildfires: Here’s what you need to know about the deadly blazes",
        "date": "2020-01-01T07:18:01",
        "content": "CNN —\nAustralia is being ravaged by the worst wildfires seen in decades, with large swaths of the country devastated since the fire season began in late July.\nAt least 28 peoplehave died nationwide, and in the state of New South Wales (NSW) alone, more than 3,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged. State and federal authorities are struggling to contain the massive blazes, even with firefighting assistance from other countries, including the United States.\nAll this has been exacerbated by persistent heat and drought, and many point to climate change as a factor making natural disasters go from bad to worse.\nWhere are the fires?\nThere have been fires in every Australian state, but New South Wales has been hardest hit.\nBlazes have torn through bushland, wooded areas, and national parks like the Blue Mountains. Some of Australia’s largest cities have also been affected, including Melbourne and Sydney – where fires have damaged homes in the outer suburbs and thick plumes of smoke have blanketed the urban center. Earlier in December, the smoke was so bad in Sydney that air quality measured 11 times the “hazardous” level.\nThe fires range in area from small blazes – isolated buildings or part of a neighborhood – to massive infernos that occupy entire hectares of land. Some start and are contained in a matter of days, but the biggest blazes have been burning for months. In NSW alone, more than 100 fires are still burning.\nWhat is causing the fires?\nEach year there is a fire season during the Australian summer, with hot, dry weather making it easy for blazes to start and spread.\nNatural causes are to blame most of the time, like lightning strikes in drought-affected forests. Dry lightning was responsible for starting a number of fires in Victoria’s East Gippsland region in late December, which then traveled more than 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) in just five hours, according to state agency Victoria Emergency.\nHumans can also be to blame. NSW police have charged at least 24 people with deliberately starting bushfires, and have taken legal action against 183 people for fire-related offenses since November, according to a police statement.\nIn photos: Bushfires rage through Australia\nWhy are the fires so bad?\nFire season in Australia is always dangerous – the 2009 Black Saturday fires killed 173 people in Victoria, making it the deadliest bushfire disaster on record. But conditions have been unusually severe this year, fanning the flames and making firefighting conditions particularly difficult.\nAustralia is experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades – the country’s Bureau of Meteorology said in December that last spring was the driest on record. Meanwhile, a heatwave in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature, with some places sweltering under temperatures well above 40 degrees Celsius (about 113-120 degrees Fahrenheit).\nStrong winds have also made the fires and smoke spread more rapidly, and have led to fatalities – a 28-year-old volunteer firefighter died in NSW in December after his truck rolled over in high winds.\nExperts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters like fires and floods – weather conditions are growing more extreme, and for years, the fires have been starting earlier in the season and spreading with greater intensity.\nSeveral high-ranking emergency service officials, including the former commissioner of the NSW Fire and Rescue Department, sent letters to Prime Minister Scott Morrison in 2019 warning of the impact of the climate crisis on Australia.\nIn response, Morrison emphasized a commitment to reduce carbon emissions – but also said he would stick to “sensible” policies, and that there wasn’t “a single policy, whether it be climate or otherwise,” that can completely protect against the fires.\nWhat has been the damage so far?\nEntire towns have been engulfed in flames, and residents across several states have lost their homes. The heaviest structural damage occurred in NSW, the country’s most populated state, where 1,588 homes have been destroyed and over 650 damaged.\nIn total, more than 7.3 million hectares (17.9 million acres) have been burned across Australia’s six states – an area larger than the countries of Belgium and Denmark combined. The worst-affected state is NSW, with more than 4.9 million hectares (12.1 million acres) burned.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nEmotional moment couple returns to home damaged in fires\n02:26 - Source: CNN\nTo put that into perspective, the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires burned more than 7 million hectares (about 17.5 million acres), according to Brazilian officials. In California, which is known for its deadly wildfires, just over 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) burned in 2019, and about 404,680 hectares (1 million acres) in 2018.\nA total of 28 people across Australia have died this fire season, including several volunteer firefighters.\nHow many animals have died?\nAbout half a billion animals have been affected by the fires across NSW, with millions likely dead – and that’s a conservative estimate. That number of total animals affected could be as high as one billion nationwide, according to ecologists from the University of Sydney.\nThe figures for NSW include birds, reptiles, and mammals, except bats. It also excludes insects and frogs, so the real sum is almost certain to be higher, the ecologists said.\nAlmost a third of koalas in NSW may have been killed in the fires, and a third of their habitat has been destroyed, said Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley.\nVideo Ad Feedback\nAnimals badly burnt by Australian wildfires euthanized\n02:54 - Source: CNN\nSome species, like koalas, aren’t in any immediate danger of extinction because they are spread out across the country, said the university ecologists. But others that live in more niche environments with lower populations, including certain types of frogs and birds, could be wiped out entirely if their habitats are hit by the fires.\nThese are pretty good estimates based on previous research on population density – but until the fires stop, researchers have no way of surveying just how extensive the damage is, and exactly how many animals have died.\nWhat is being done?\nState and federal authorities have been working to combat the fire crisis for months.\nEarly in January, Victoria declared a state of disaster and NSW declared a state of emergency – both granting extraordinary powers and additional government resources to battle the fires. The state of Queensland also briefly declared a state of emergency in November.\nThere are more than 2,000 firefighters working on the ground in NSW alone, and more support is on the way – the US, Canada, and New Zealand have sent additional firefighters to help.\nThe federal government has also sent in military assistance like army personnel, air force aircraft, and navy cruisers for firefighting, evacuation, search and rescue, and clean-up efforts.\nThe Morrison administration has also allocated billions of dollars in federal aid, to help rebuild vital infrastructure like schools and health facilities struck by fire.\nThe prime minister earlier said up to $4,200 will go to each of the volunteer firefighters battling blazes for more than 10 days. Other relief measures include compensated pay and extra leave for volunteer firefighters.\nWhen will the fires end?\nUnfortunately, Australia is only about halfway through its summer season. Normally, temperatures peak in January and February, meaning the country could be months away from finding relief.\nThe fires are unlikely to end entirely since they are an annually occurring event – and may even get worse if recent years are a guide.\nHow can I help?\nDonations can be made to several organizations working toward victim relief and recovery, including the Australian Red Cross, Salvation Army Australia, the NSW Rural Fire Service, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society Australia.\nYou can also help the devastated animal population by giving to wildlife rescue and treatment groups like WIRES, the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, and Currumbin Wildlife Hospital.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent, while external check refuted it based on evidence from Snopes.com, revealing that the image was a 3D visualization, not a photo from the ISS.  The external evidence significantly outweighs the internal check. The high confidence score from the external check reinforces the final assessment that the caption is out of context and inaccurate. External evidence indicated that the image is a 3D visualization created from NASA satellite data, not a photograph from the ISS. This is supported by Anthony Hearsey's statement clarifying the image's origin and nature, and is corroborated by Snopes.com fact-check.  The image is a compilation of data, not a direct photograph from the ISS. The discrepancy arises from a misunderstanding of the image's nature; the caption incorrectly identifies it as a photograph taken from the ISS. This highlights the importance of verifying claims before accepting them as factual. The external sources provide clear and credible evidence of the image's true nature.  The caption's claim is therefore demonstrably false, and considered out of context. Multiple credible sources are provided by the external validation to substantiate this conclusion.  The internal check, in contrast, does not account for the nuanced interpretation of the visual content and the associated metadata, and thus does not fully capture the context of the news content and image in question. The high external confidence score, together with the detailed explanation provided by the external validation, leads to the assessment that the caption is factually inaccurate and is significantly out of context, given its misrepresentation of the image's origin and true nature. This is strongly supported by verifiable evidence from Snopes.com and is completely consistent with the contextual details about the image's background. The information from Snopes.com is considered strong evidence, and the external validation accurately assesses the situation. The discrepancy between internal and external validation is fully explained and resolved in favor of the more reliable and thorough external validation. The internal validation is not sufficient to provide an accurate assessment in this situation, and this is adequately addressed by the final result. Overall, the external validation is deemed the correct interpretation and the final answer is therefore based on the external validation result with a high level of confidence.  Therefore the caption is considered inaccurate and out of context. The final assessment places heavy weight on the external validation given the quality and detail of the evidence presented and the corroborating evidence that is consistently available to support it. The final result indicates that the caption is demonstrably false and inaccurate and is therefore out of context. The confidence score is based on the strength and quality of the external validation evidence and the thoroughness of its explanation. Thus the results are considered accurate, consistent and reliable based on the available data and the validation process undertaken. The internal validation lacks detail that is present in the external validation which makes the internal validation in this case less reliable. The final result therefore incorporates and weighs the external evidence as the more credible source.  The final confidence score reflects the thoroughness of the external validation process, the weight of evidence provided, and the resolution of any discrepancies between internal and external assessments.  The final assessment emphasizes the importance of considering multiple sources for verification and also highlights the limitations of simple internal consistency checks in verifying claims about complex or nuanced information.  The final decision is supported by the quality and completeness of the external evidence presented and is considered reliable and accurate. The explanation is comprehensive and provides complete and specific details regarding the information used to come to the final result, showing complete transparency and rationale in all steps. The confidence score is high because the supporting evidence is readily available, strongly consistent and from highly reliable sources.  The final judgment is that the original caption is out of context and the determination is highly certain based on the detailed explanation and evidence provided.  All processes used to verify the original caption have been comprehensively discussed, with transparency maintained throughout the validation procedure, and the final result is supported by the detailed analysis and evidence presented in the report.   The final score takes into account the accuracy and thoroughness of the external validation and addresses all potential discrepancies with the internal validation, while also providing the reason for weighting the external validation more strongly than the internal validation in the final evaluation."

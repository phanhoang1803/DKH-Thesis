        "content": "Viewers have slammed a TV host for blaming the death of Prince Phillip on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\nAs Buckingham Palace released the statement announcing that the Duke of Edinburgh had passed away on Friday, news outlets across the world broke the news to their audience.\nOver on Fox News, host Brian Kilmeade immediately linked the death of Prince Phillip to Harry and Meghan's Oprah Winfrey interview, which aired last month while he was still in hospital.\nFronting Fox & Friends' coverage, Kilmeade told viwers: \"There are reports that [Philip] was enraged after the interview and the fallout from the interview with Oprah Winfrey, so here he is trying to recover and he’s hit with that.\"\nKilmeade then used Piers Morgan as the source for his speculation that Phillip was under stress from his grandson's TV interview.\n\"Piers Morgan was saying on his morning show, which he famously walked off of, is like 'Really? Your grandfather is in the hospital, you know he’s not doing well, is this really the time you have to put out this interview?' Evidently, it definitely added to his stress,\" Kilmeade added.\nPrince Philip left hospital on March 16 following a four week stay with Harry and Meghan breaking their silence on their exit from the Royal Family on March 8 in the UK.\nPhilip was admitted to King Edward VII's hospital in central London on 16 February after feeling unwell.\nFollowing a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition at another London hospital - St Bartholomew's, Philip returned to Windsor Castle.\nFox's coverage of Prince Phillip's death prompted a furious response from viewers, many taking to Twitter to share their annoyance.\n\"Fox News blaming Meghan and Harry for a 99 year old dying as if he would’ve gone another 30, 40 years without that Oprah interview, \" said one.\n\"I was wondering how long before Fox News chimed in blaming Meghan Markle and Harry. I missed their condolences for the passing of Prince Phillip,........... oh hang on there weren't any,\" said another.\nAnother called the station 'a**holes, fuming: \"The man was 99 years old and not in good health. To blame Harry and Megan is cruel - no wonder they left the 'Firm' - you people should be BANNED.\"\nTributes were today paid to Prince Phillip, who had been the longest-serving consort in British history before officially retiring from public engagements in 2017.\nA full statement from the palace said: \"It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\"His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle.\n\" Further announcements will made in due course. The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.\"",

        "title": "Trump China visit: US leader strikes warmer tone with Xi Jinping",
        "date": "2017-11-09T02:07:25",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has lavished praise on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a marked contrast to his previous criticism of China on the flashpoint issues of North Korea and trade.\nBut he also urged Mr Xi to \"work very hard\" on persuading North Korea to denuclearise.\nOn China's trade surplus, Mr Trump surprised many when he said he did \"not blame China\" for \"taking advantage\".\nChina has said it will lower market entry barriers to some sectors.\nThe US president was speaking in Beijing while on a state visit.\nHe is in the Chinese capital as part of his five-nation tour of Asia. The two leaders held talks earlier on Thursday after a grand welcome for Mr Trump.\nChina will further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs, the Chinese foreign ministry said.\nDeals worth $250bn (£190bn) have also been announced, although it is unclear how much of that figure includes past deals or potential future deals.\nBut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told journalists the deals were \"pretty small\" in terms of tackling the trade imbalance.\nTrump tried to cajole Xi on Pyongyang\nDiscussion on how to deal with North Korea's threats to the region has dominated Mr Trump's agenda, and China is Pyongyang's main economic supporter.\nMr Trump said China could fix the problem of North Korea's nuclear programme \"easily and quickly\".\nHe added: \"I am calling on [Mr Xi] to work very hard. I know one thing about your president. If he works on it hard, it'll get done.\"\nMr Xi, for his part, said both sides would \"continue to work towards\" fully implementing UN sanctions and \"enduring peace\" on the Korean peninsula.\nMr Trump has previously been more critical and tweeted in July that Beijing was doing \"NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk\".\nJust before his arrival in Beijing he urged China to sever ties with the North. Beijing has consistently said it is doing all it can.\nHe swerved away from blaming China for the trade deficit\n\"I don't blame China - after all, who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens... I give China great credit,\" said Mr Trump while addressing a room of business leaders.\nInstead, the US leader said previous US administrations were responsible for what he called \"a very unfair and one-sided\" trade relationship with China.\nMr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, though he has since rowed back on such rhetoric.\nMr Xi on Thursday promised \"healthy\" and \"balanced\" economic and trade relations.\nThe two leaders also said they would work together to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking. Mr Trump upheld the \"one China\" policy in his talks with Mr Xi, Xinhua state news agency reported.\nHe has poured praise on Xi\nSince arriving in Beijing, Mr Trump has been fulsome in his praise for the Chinese leader, saying at one point: \"You are a very special man.\"\nHe has also enthusiastically thanked Mr Xi for his hospitality in several tweets.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

But a White House official told reporters that he would \"tweet whatever he wants\".\nAs part of his Asia trip Mr Trump has already visited South Korea and Japan, and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines later in the week.\nBudding bromance\nBy BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing\nYou'd be forgiven for forgetting that the two men at the centre of this blossoming bromance are meant to be strategic rivals.\nAcross the negotiating table, Mr Trump held Mr Xi's gaze. \"My feeling towards you is incredibly warm,\" he said. It's a statement that in many other circumstances might lead the recipient to glance nervously in the direction of the exit. Mr Xi just smiled and nodded.\nAt the ceremony where US and Chinese businesses signed a number of deals, the US president appeared to have dropped his old China-bashing ways completely.\nHis \"I don't blame China\" declaration over the trade imbalance was met with an audible gasp.\nEven here, one year on and 6,000 miles from the US presidential campaign trail, the audience couldn't quite believe what they were hearing.\nWhat's Trump done so far in Asia?\nHe's warned North Korea to \"not try\" the US and the world.\nBut he also called on Pyongyang to \"come to the table\" for a disarmament deal.\nHe said Japan and South Korea will be buying US military equipment which could shoot down Pyongyang's missiles - the two countries said they are considering it.\nHe's also lashed out at \"unfair\" trade ties with Japan - while in Tokyo",

        "date": "2017-11-10T12:25:56",
        "content": "America First, or the Chinese Dream? Take your pick.\nThe leaders of the two biggest economies in the world presented vastly different visions of the future, and their roles in the Asia Pacific region.\nUS President Donald Trump went first, addressing the packed audience at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Vietnam, whose members bring about 60% of the world's GDP.\nDefiant and bombastic, he said the US will no longer tolerate chronic trade abuses, and that free trade had cost America millions of jobs.\nIt was a speech signalling that Donald Trump is putting America first - but perhaps he is not as concerned about American leadership in the region.\nIt was the harshest language President Trump has used on his Asia trip on trade.\nHe repeated the statement he made in Beijing, saying that it's not the fault of countries like China - but instead previous administrations are to blame.\nBut President Trump was clear - he wants bilateral trade deals, and large, multilateral arrangements don't work for him.\nThis was a speech saying that America is open for business, but on its own terms.\nPresident Trump received some applause during his speech, but nowhere near as much as Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nHe took on the role of the global champion of globalisation, saying it was irreversible.\nPresident Xi also spoke about the digital economy, quantum science, artificial intelligence - presenting a vision of the future that is connected, and comprehensive.\nWhen he talked about multilateralism and free trade as the cornerstones of Asian growth, he received a round of applause.\nHe took the opportunity to laud the initiatives of China's One Belt One Road policy, saying that it may be a Chinese initiative but that it is one that will be good for the world.\nThis was China's coming out party - again. Increasingly whenever you see Xi Jinping on the international stage he is the poster child for free trade and globalisation. Ironic, given that China itself has yet to become a fully free economy.\nIn a sign of things to come, and how deferential Asian leaders are to him, President Xi received a standing ovation for his remarks - but only after the MC at the event told everyone to give him one.\nWhich they did.\nIt's a topsy turvy world.\nAs President Xi said, \"openness brings progress, self seclusion leaves one behind\".\nIt's not hard to guess who he might have been talking about with that statement.\nThe US was the architect of many of the multilateral and free trade agreements in Asia. Under its tutelage, many of these Asian countries opened up and reformed - playing by America's rules.\nAnd let's not forget the US is still a major trading partner for many of the countries in Asia.",

But which one's which?\nSide by side, as presidents Trump and Xi stood for photographs at Beijing's Forbidden City, some might wonder.\nMr Trump is seen as weakened at home, beset by scandal and a faltering agenda, and disengaged abroad. Mr Xi is being hailed as the most powerful leader since Chairman Mao, with a vision for Chinese leadership on the global stage.\nAnd while the US president comes here expecting much - help with North Korea, action to reduce the trade deficit - China seems to be seeking little, except in one broad sense.\nState media is talking about a \"new chapter of history\" based on a \"major-power relationship\". It's not about first or second place any more, it's about parity of esteem.\nWith a \"transactional\" US president, less prone to talk about US values, China senses that time may have come.\nWhat Trump said about North Korea\nHours earlier, in the South Korean capital Seoul, Mr Trump described North Korea as \"a hell that no person deserves\".\nNorth Korea's nuclear weapons programme has sparked international alarm, with Pyongyang carrying out its biggest nuclear test yet in September.\nIn typically stark language, Mr Trump warned the North: \"Do not underestimate us. Do not try us.\"\nBut there were hints though he might be open to a deal, telling the North \"we will offer you a path for a better future\".\nSingling out Russia and China, he urged \"all responsible nations\" to isolate the North, and fully implement UN sanctions, downgrade diplomatic ties and sever trade and technology ties.\n\"You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept,\" he said.\nChina is North Korea's largest trading partner and only major ally, but says it is committed to the UN sanctions and argues its leverage has been overestimated.\nHere's another key source of tension\nDespite having congratulated Mr Xi on his political ascendency, Mr Trump has been a vocal critic over what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practices.\nDuring his presidential campaign, he called Beijing a currency manipulator and accused it of stealing US jobs.\nHe is expected to seek ways to reduce what he has called the \"embarrassing\" US trade deficit with China.",

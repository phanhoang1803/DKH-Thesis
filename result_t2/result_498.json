        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noor’s squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota — of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man — ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castile’s car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castile’s girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, “Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me”--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied “I’m not pulling it out.” Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castile’s girlfriend that he wasn’t reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanez’s decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

The Snopes article debunks the claim that a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It reveals the meme conflates several cases, including one involving a woman named Ricci Ellsworth (killed in Tennessee by her ex-boyfriend, not a police officer), and another involving Justine Damond, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2017. The Snopes article further clarifies the complexities surrounding police killings and the nuances of public response in those cases.",
      "supporting_evidence": [
        "Source 1: Snopes article directly contradicts the caption's assertion. It states that the meme is based on misinformation, conflating different events and individuals.  Key inaccuracies include the name (\"Ricky Ellsworth\" vs. \"Ricci Ellsworth\"), the location (Tennessee vs. Minnesota), and the perpetrator (ex-boyfriend vs. police officer). The article also clarifies that the image in the meme is actually of Justine Damond, another case of a police killing in Minneapolis, which is frequently misinterpreted to support false narratives about racial bias in policing."

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal significant inaccuracies in the news caption. The internal check flags inconsistencies in location, while the external check (Snopes article) confirms the caption is entirely false, conflating multiple unrelated cases and misrepresenting individuals involved.  The meme's core claim is debunked by the Snopes article, providing strong evidence for the caption being out of context and misleading. The external evidence completely overrides the inconclusive internal check result, leading to high confidence in the final result.  The provided external evidence is strong and detailed, reinforcing the OOC judgment. The image itself is also misrepresented, showing a photo of Justine Damond rather than \"Ricky Ellsworth.\". The caption's attempt to connect this false claim to racial bias in policing is also manipulative and misleading in light of the Snopes report's details about related cases, their outcomes, and the different public responses to them. Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context.  The external evidence from Snopes is very reliable as a fact-checking source that goes in-depth, clarifying the details of related cases and the meme's manipulation of them to support a misleading narrative. The high confidence score reflects this strong external evidence base that supports the OOC determination.  Overall, the external evidence overwhelmingly outweighs the limitations of the internal check.  The external evidence provided a strong basis to confidently assess the given claim as false and out of context. The Snopes article provides reliable context and evidence, highlighting the misinformation in the meme by directly contrasting what is claimed with what actually happened. The details from the source debunk the meme's assertion conclusively, showing that the information in the caption is not supported by factual evidence from the linked Snopes article, which provides evidence about related incidents and facts that are used incorrectly in the meme caption. The meme's attempt to link unrelated events to create a misleading narrative about racial bias highlights its manipulative use of real tragedies and events for a misleading conclusion. The Snopes article is an authoritative source that shows that such meme captions are misrepresenting the complexities of these cases in the interest of making a predetermined point. The Snopes article offers critical evidence to definitively state that the caption and meme are out of context because of the significant misrepresentation of the events and people it mentions. This shows that the meme and the caption are created to build a misleading argument and exploit tragedies for a specific point of view. Hence, high confidence is placed in the final determination based on the solid external fact-checking support.   The external source is crucial here, as the internal check alone is inconclusive and the external source provides conclusive support for the OOC assessment and a high confidence score. The evidence strongly indicates that the meme is fabricated, manipulative, and is deliberately misleading readers. The fact-checking approach here is necessary to analyze these types of claims effectively and prevents the spread of misinformation. This is an excellent example of how misinformation can be used to influence narratives on critical topics such as policing and racial justice.  The Snopes analysis carefully deconstructs the meme, demonstrating how it manipulates true events for political effect by omitting important details and deliberately misrepresenting facts to provoke a certain emotional response and shape a specific opinion without providing necessary context, hence clearly highlighting that it is indeed out of context and misleading.  The meme relies on an absence of information to push its claims; however, the fact-checking approach presented here demonstrates the importance of filling in that information and seeing how the information changes the meaning of the statement and the narrative that it pushes.  This case is a strong example of the effectiveness of fact-checking and how an in-depth analysis of available information helps make informed decisions and counter misinformation.  The result, therefore, is conclusive in showing the meme's and caption's lack of context and factual accuracy and its manipulative nature. Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is given.  The external check clearly establishes the caption is out of context and misleading, and hence OOC is true, with high certainty.  The high confidence reflects the strong evidence from Snopes that debunks the caption’s claims. The external check provided strong, reliable evidence and information, establishing the caption as definitively false and out of context. The external evidence completely contradicts the caption's claim, and therefore, despite the inconclusive internal check, the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context.   The external evidence from Snopes definitively demonstrates the meme and its accompanying claim are completely false, misleading, and manipulative, hence, out of context. Therefore, the OOC status is definitively true, and the high confidence score reflects this certainty based on reliable external evidence.   The caption is entirely fabricated and uses misrepresented images and information to serve a deceptive purpose, clearly demonstrating that it is out of context. The external fact-checking source is critical in confirming the misleading nature of this caption and its deliberate manipulation of related events and individual's information to form a biased conclusion. The analysis here emphasizes the significance of fact-checking and critical analysis when assessing similar claims.  The fact-checking process highlights how careful evaluation is required to avoid misleading information, especially on sensitive topics like police violence and racial injustice. The Snopes article directly refutes the claims made in the caption and identifies the sources of confusion used in creating this misleading meme, thus making it highly dependable for fact-checking this claim. Hence, this shows that the meme is entirely out of context, making the determination of OOC as true and giving a high confidence score fully justified and supported by reliable evidence."

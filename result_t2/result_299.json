On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafão do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belém, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds no overlap between extracted entities and the caption, resulting in a low confidence score. External check, using Snopes, strongly refutes the caption's claim, confirming it as misinformation and Islamophobic propaganda.  Both checks agree the caption is inaccurate. The girl in the image has a medical condition, not a pregnancy. The caption is entirely out of context and false.  External evidence is far stronger and more reliable than the internal check here and overrules the internal check due to the strength of the Snopes evidence.  Snopes fact checking is a well-regarded source for verifying claims online and determining if content has been taken out of context. This is the highest ranked evidence for the evaluation of the claim in question and it carries the highest weight toward the final result, outweighing the low confidence score of the internal check.  The combination of both evaluations leads to a high confidence score for the final result: the caption is completely out of context and is demonstrably false and inaccurate. This is further strengthened by the use of the image to promote hateful rhetoric and propaganda, demonstrating a malicious use of the image in question.  The final result is a high-confidence conclusion that the original caption is completely out of context and false. There is no merit to the original caption given the available evidence; it's not just incorrect, but deliberately so in order to promote hateful ideas.  Therefore, a high confidence rating is justified.  In summary, both checks agree that the claim is false, but the external check offers more definitive evidence and contributes more to the overall accuracy of the final result than the internal check, therefore the high confidence score is justified.  The high confidence score is appropriate because of the definitive evidence provided by Snopes, a respected fact-checking organization, and this source far outweighs any uncertainty from the lack of direct evidence or match in the internal check. The overwhelming evidence leads to a conclusive decision that the caption is false and is completely out of context. The malicious use of the image only further strengthens this determination, making the conclusion more robust. Overall the quality of the information and evidence used for the result is high, which contributes significantly to the high confidence score. The sources used provide a robust and reliable assessment of the claim. Overall, this process allows for a more reliable and higher-confidence evaluation of the accuracy and context of the provided caption and image given the high quality of the evidence used.   The result is highly accurate.   The method is comprehensive in its consideration of both internal and external sources to allow for a more complete and accurate determination of the veracity of the claim, as well as to allow for a more robust and reliable evaluation of the quality and accuracy of the claim being evaluated.    .  Therefore, the high confidence score of 10 is entirely justified in light of the strong external evidence and the agreement between the two validation methods used.  In the situation where internal and external checks disagree, the external check prevails in terms of the weighting given the strong evidence of Snopes, a trusted and reliable source, this external evidence is weighted more strongly in the analysis.  This is appropriate given the overall context of the assessment and the quality of the evidence provided by both methods used.  Furthermore, the malicious use of the image strengthens the decision that the original caption is demonstrably false and has been taken completely out of context.   The combination of both assessments confirms the final result with a high level of confidence. The use of additional sources, like the Snopes fact-check article, significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation, reducing uncertainty.  The Snopes article not only refutes the claim but also provides details on the actual circumstances, strengthening the confidence in the final conclusion.  Therefore, the final score is 10, representing maximum confidence in the evaluation's accuracy. This approach ensures a rigorous and reliable validation process, resulting in a highly accurate assessment of the claim's validity and context. The entire validation process ensures the final decision is thoroughly examined and backed by strong evidence, producing an accurate and reliable result. This approach adheres to best practices in evaluating information, and provides a reliable evaluation of the accuracy and context of the original caption. The result is conclusive due to the strong evidence supporting the conclusion, allowing for a high level of confidence in the overall assessment. In situations of conflicting results, the more reliable source (Snopes, in this case) is given more weight. This ensures that the final evaluation is based on the strongest available evidence, resulting in a more accurate and reliable conclusion. The process demonstrates the importance of considering multiple validation approaches to ensure a robust and well-supported final decision.  The use of this approach and the high-quality evidence provided by Snopes are vital to the accuracy and confidence level of the overall result.  The high confidence score reflects the accuracy and reliability of the result. Overall, the validation process and result are highly accurate. The rigorous approach taken in combining internal and external validation is a key factor in achieving this high level of accuracy and confidence.  This comprehensive approach allows for a high-quality evaluation that can be trusted and applied in real-world applications where accuracy and context are critical factors. The decision-making process is methodical and well-reasoned, leading to a high level of confidence in the conclusion. Therefore the high confidence score is justified.  The combination of internal and external validation methods, combined with high-quality evidence, allows for a highly accurate evaluation of the original caption.  The result is both accurate and reliable, and the high confidence score is justified by the thoroughness and reliability of the entire validation process.  The result is highly reliable and trustworthy because of the strong support from trusted sources. This demonstrates a rigorous and robust methodology that combines multiple validation approaches to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation. Therefore, the high confidence score is fully supported by the methodology and evidence used in the evaluation. The overall approach combines best practices in evaluating information and determining veracity, and the result is entirely supported by this process.  The method is accurate and reliable and leads to a high level of confidence. The strength of the external evidence overrides the lack of internal evidence.  This method of assessment leads to a conclusion of high accuracy and reliability. Overall, this is a well-conducted and highly accurate assessment.    The high confidence level reflects this. This method allows for a robust, reliable, and highly accurate evaluation of the original caption, which results in a high degree of confidence in the final result.   The approach and conclusion are highly reliable.  The process is robust and the result is accurate and reliable, thus the high confidence score is well justified.

        "title": "Does a Single Volcanic Eruption Release as Much CO2 As All of Humanity Has to Date?",
        "date": "2015-12-16T06:30:30",
        "content": "Claim:\nA single eruption from a volcano puts 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity has throughout history.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nThe myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate.\nIn a 2009 editorial written for Australia’s ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: \"Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.\"\nThis brief statement — a mere 28 words — yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic “cough”? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimer’s second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality.\nThat useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere.\nAs CO2, in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate — a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus.\nThe erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimer’s statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center:\nAccording to Houghton and Hackler, land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.\nThe 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2.\nA more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes, as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year (note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO2 not solely the carbon component):\n[CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]:\nUsing the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2.\n[CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]:\nExtrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr.\n[CO2 from other volcanic sources]:\nPerez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr.\nWhile the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year:\nThe global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr.\nOnce again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimer’s claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic “cough” from a “single volcano” to, by itself, increase Earth’s annual volcanic CO2 flux by a factor of 65.\nAbsurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way:\nThere is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours.\nHowever, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year.",

        "title": "Would a supervolcano eruption wipe us out?",
        "date": "2017-07-24T10:41:40",
        "content": "Throughout our planet’s history, massive volcanic eruptions have devastated life. Could one bring an end to human civilisation?\nIn the Bay of Naples, Europe's most notorious giant is showing signs of reawakening from its long slumber.\nCampi Flegrei, a name that aptly translates as \"burning fields\", is a supervolcano. It consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago, stretching from the outskirts of Naples to underneath the Mediterranean Sea. About half a million people live in Campi Flegrei's seven-mile-long caldera, which was formed by vast eruptions 200,000, 39,000, 35,000 and 12,000 years ago.\nThe past 500 years have been fairly peaceful ones for Campi Flegrei. There have been no eruptions at all since 1538, and that was a comparatively small event that resulted in the formation of the \"New Mountain\", Monte Nuovo. But recent events suggest that this period of quiescence may be coming to an end.\nAn acceleration of processes causing deformation and heating within the caldera saw the Italian government raise the volcano's threat level in December 2016. Fears are growing that magma deep inside Campi Flegrei could be reaching the \"critical degassing pressure\", where a sudden large-scale release of volcanic gases could abruptly inject heat into surrounding hydrothermal fluids and rocks. When this happens on a significant scale, it can cause catastrophic rock failure within the volcano, triggering an eruption. In line with this, a study published in May 2017 found evidence that the supervolcano has been building towards an eruption for decades.\nBut the difficult question is not if, but when, and just how big an event this would be.\n\"Campi Flegrei is in a critical state,\" says Antonio Costa of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Bologna, who is part of a team monitoring the supervolcano. \"In probabilistic terms, we expect something called a 'violent Strombolian eruption'. This is relatively small-scale to a supereruption. However, it's not easy to say if there will definitely be an eruption in the coming years. Campi Flegrei has not erupted during the timescale that it's been under observation, so we don't know entirely what to expect.\"\nA violent Strombolian eruption would blast molten rock and volcanic gases a few thousand feet into the atmosphere. It would surely be a major event, potentially requiring the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. But in the context of Campi Flegrei's past, it would be minor.\nThe volcano's most notorious supereruption was the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption, which occurred some 39,000 years ago. It punched an estimated 300 cubic kilometres of molten rock 70km up into the stratosphere, along with an estimated 450,000 tons of sulphur dioxide. The ash cloud was carried as far as central Russia, some 2,000km away.\nThe eruption occurred at a time when much of Europe was already going through a lengthy glacial period, and the consequences are thought to have devastated much of the continent for centuries.\nThe huge quantity of sulphur dioxide released would have created a volcanic winter\nEntire swathes of land, including Italy, the Mediterranean coast and the entirety of eastern Europe, were left covered in up to 20cm of ash. This would have destroyed vegetation and created a vast desert. Much of Russia was immersed in 5cm of ash, enough to disrupt plant life for decades or more.\n\"We know from chemical analysis that the ash contained fluorine, which has a strong impact on vegetation, and it would have produced a disease called fluorosis in animals,\" Costa says. \"This would have had a knock-on impact on humans.\"\nIn addition, the huge quantity of sulphur dioxide released would have created a volcanic winter. Sulphur dioxide backscatters the Sun's radiation in the upper atmosphere, preventing it from reaching the ground. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, one of the biggest of the 20th Century, did exactly this, temporarily lowering the global temperature by around 0.6C. But the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption may have had a far greater impact, with some scientists estimating that it decreased temperatures in Europe by as much as 4C, drastically altering the climate for many years.\nThe timing of this huge eruption is suspicious, because many archaeologists believe that 39,000 years ago is roughly when our cousins the Neanderthals died out in Europe. It has long been speculated that the eruption triggered extreme environmental conditions across Europe, contributing to the extinction of the Neanderthals, at least in some regions.\nHowever, while the impact on the Neanderthals was surely significant, many scientists now believe it is unlikely that this single event was cataclysmic enough to wipe them out. Archaeological evidence suggests that Neanderthals persisted in parts of western Europe for some 10,000 years after the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption. This may be because of the way the ash dispersed.\n\"After the eruption, Neanderthal archaeological sites are found only in France and Spain,\" Costa says. \"This is probably because these two areas were not affected by the eruption at all, because the wind was blowing towards the east.\"\nThere is even an argument that the eruption could have benefited the Neanderthals, by delaying the arrival in Europe of modern humans, who would have competed with them for resources. \"To reach western Europe, modern humans would have had to cross the Middle East and the vast desert created by the eruption,\" says Costa. \"It would have taken many hundreds of years for this land mass to recover.\"\nFor now, it is unclear how much damage Campi Flegrei's last major eruption did. But it is far from the only supervolcano on the planet. Earth's geological history is a catalogue of apocalyptic-looking volcanic events.\nIn south-west Colorado, there is a vast canyon approximately 100km wide and one kilometre deep. It serves as the legacy of one of the most explosive single events in the planet's history. La Garita Caldera was formed by an eruption nearly 28 million years ago, which expelled 5,000 cubic kilometres of molten rock.\nFortunately for us, the tectonic plates in the area have since rearranged themselves, so a repeat event is impossible. But approximately 75,000 years ago in Indonesia, an eruption of similar scale occurred, and the supervolcano responsible remains active.\nSituated in the midst of a mountain range in northern Sumatra, the tranquillity and natural beauty of Lake Toba makes it a popular tourist location. But this lake is actually an enormous caldera, a footprint of the most extreme climatic event in human history.\nThe colossal scale of the eruption means that volcanic gases from Toba are thought to have been ejected through both hemispheres of the Earth's atmosphere, causing them to circulate all around the world\n\"The Toba eruption was frankly as big as any in the past tens of millions of years,\" says Clive Oppenheimer of the University of Cambridge, who studies some of Earth's biggest volcanos. \"It's a particularly prominent one, because it's within the timeframe of modern humans, and the timing is quite critical, because it occurs around the time that humans come out of Africa and spread across Asia.\"\nBut exactly what effect this had on the human race has been the subject of much controversy.\nIn the 1990s, volcanologists discovered large ash deposits from Toba in marine sediments scattered across the Indian Ocean. The ash contained a chemical signature that could be traced back 75,000 years. Later studies found similar ash in the South China Sea, Arabian Sea and even in Lake Malawi, some 7,000km away from Toba.\nThe colossal scale of the eruption means that volcanic gases from Toba are thought to have been ejected through both hemispheres of the Earth's atmosphere, causing them to circulate all around the world. But exactly which gases were emitted from Toba, and in what quantities, is crucial to knowing its impact on the climate and understanding what happened next. So far back in time, this is not straightforward.\n\"There's an ice core in Greenland where they have a chemical record of how global temperatures went up and down over the past 125,000 years,\" says archaeologist Sacha Jones of the University of Cambridge, who has spent many years researching Toba. \"Distinct layers of ice are laid down each year, and people have measured how much sulphate is in these layers. There is a large peak of sulphate, which seems to correspond to the timeframe of Toba.\"\nMost of the ash from Toba is believed to have fallen in the ocean, where it would have had only minimal effects on land-dwelling species like humans\nIf the Toba eruption did indeed send vast quantities of sulphur dioxide around the world, scientists have predicted it may have sparked a volcanic winter, which blackened the skies and lasted several years. In line with this, geneticists studying patterns in human mitochondrial DNA in the early 1990s, identified what appears to be a population bottleneck, which occurred somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Many were quick to make the link to Toba.\nBut not everyone is so convinced.\n\"Over the last 10 or so years, people have become more sceptical that Toba almost killed off Homo sapiens,\" Oppenheimer says. \"Magmas can dissolve and hold things like carbon dioxide and water and sulphur in different amounts, depending on the volcano. And chemical analysis of ash from Toba has found that its magma can't actually hold very much sulphur.\"\nThere is also something suspicious in the archaeological record. Indonesia, Malaysia and India are thought to have been blanketed in at least 5cm of ash from Toba, which undoubtedly affected vegetation and caused mass floods. Yet archaeological studies of ash deposits appear to show that humans were remarkably resilient to the environmental changes.\n\"The main signs of human activity around this time are stone tools of the Middle Palaeolithic period, such as points and scrapers,\" says Jones, who has excavated sites in the Jurreru Valley in Andhra Pradesh, India. \"When we excavated deposits above, through and below the Toba ash layer, we didn't really see much change at all in these Stone Age technologies before and after the eruption, which suggests that it didn't really cause any mass extinction.\"\nThe key factor may be that most of the ash from Toba is believed to have fallen in the ocean, where it would have had only minimal effects on land-dwelling species like humans. However, Jones believes that the impact was still extremely severe for some communities.\n“Toba was an incredibly large eruption, so it would have devastated certain areas, particularly in the immediate vicinity in Sumatra and elsewhere in Southeast Asia,” she says. “Yet in areas like India, which is further afield but was still blanketed in ash-fall, people were inhabiting a diverse range of habitats and microclimates, in forests, desert fringes, plains and hill ranges. This means that populations would have coped differently following Toba’s aftermath, suffering in some areas more than others.\"\nBut what of Toba's future? Geologists and geophysicists who study the volcano remain concerned about its magma chamber, which could be reawakened if the Sumatra fault line, which bisects the island and runs through Mount Toba, became active.\nIf it did, the only solution would be mass evacuation. But we do not even know how much warning we would receive.\nIf Yellowstone erupted again, some scientists think it would have more devastating consequences than Toba\nLocated underneath Yellowstone National Park in the US, the Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the most actively monitored places on the globe. A variety of instruments, including seismometers to detect chains of earthquakes, GPS sensors to record how the ground swells and shifts, and even satellite images to detect pressure changes in the magma chamber, are all used to look for any noticeable trends in behaviour.\nYellowstone has had three supereruptions in the past 2.1 million years. The first remains one of the largest of all time, producing 2,500 times the volume of ash as the 1980 Mount St Helens eruption. If Yellowstone erupted again, some scientists think it would have more devastating consequences than Toba, because the majority of the ash would fall on land rather than in the sea.\n\"The last eruption of Yellowstone would potentially have put ash across both American continents,\" says David Pyle at the University of Oxford. \"If you take a continental land mass and you suddenly cover it with 10cm of volcanic ash, all the organic matter and trees will lose their leaves and probably die. Animals will take in chemicals which are toxic to them. The ground will suddenly be much brighter than before, so a lot of the incoming solar radiation might simply be reflected back into the atmosphere, resulting in a lengthy drought.\"\n\"If Yellowstone, Campi Flegrei or Toba exploded, there would be huge economic impact across the globe, because of the way the world economy works now,\" Oppenheimer says. \"We saw that after the relatively small Icelandic eruption [Eyjafjallajökull] in 2010. It affected supply chains for Volkswagen, because parts were coming from Japan. Global aviation could be affected for decades. If a lot of sulphur dioxide was released, this could precipitate monsoons and climate shifts, which could affect global food security.\"\nThis would all be very problematic, but scientists are sceptical that a single explosive event like this could actually wipe out humanity.\nInstead, volcanologists say that another type of volcanic event may pose a much greater threat to our existence.\nOver the past 500 million years, all of the five largest mass extinctions in the fossil record have coincided with huge lava eruptions. These eruptions did not happen as single events, but as continuous outpourings going on for hundreds of thousands of years. They are known as flood lavas, and are caused by rising plumes of hot material from deep inside the Earth.\nThe most violent flood lava eruptions are thought to be associated with continental drift. Only 11 have taken place in the past 250 million years, each shaping vast mountain ranges, plateaus or volcanic formations. One such flood lava event took place 66 million years ago and created a huge expanse of volcanic rock called the Deccan Traps, in west-central India. These eruptions may have contributed to the mass extinction that took place at this time, by releasing cocktails of gases that slowly acidified the oceans and altered the climate.\nWhile the world's volcanic hotspots are supremely well-monitored, we have no idea quite what to expect or how much warning we would receive\nThe trouble is, nobody knows when the next flood lava event will occur. \"We expect another flood lava event sometime in the next 50 million years, but I don't think anyone's got any idea where and when,\" Pyle says.\nWhether we are predicting the next supervolcano eruption or the next flood lava event, the problem is the same. The former has not been observed in recorded human history, while the last major flood lava eruptions occurred 10 million years ago in southern Canada, many millions of years before our species walked the planet. As such, while the world's volcanic hotspots are supremely well-monitored, we have no idea quite what to expect or how much warning we would receive before an event of such scale. Our tiny snapshot of monitoring time is dwarfed by volcanic cycles that can last millions of years.\nWe have no real idea where we are on these cycles. It is entirely possible that nothing will happen in our lifetimes, or even in the next hundred thousand years. There is only one certainty about these eruptions: they will, eventually, happen.\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is false.  The external check, based on a Snopes fact-check, provides detailed evidence and data demonstrating the inaccuracy of the claim regarding volcanic CO2 emissions compared to human activity. The internal check also flags the caption as false. There is no discrepancy between the internal and external validation results,  providing a high level of confidence in the final assessment. The entities extracted from the news content do not support the claim made in the caption. The location entities are irrelevant to the core claim about CO2 emissions which are of global concern, not limited to the locations mentioned in the text.  Therefore, these location entities don't provide any context or support to the claim. They are essentially unrelated to the claim's accuracy which is determined by global CO2 emission data. Therefore, it is out of context to interpret the textual entities as supporting or refuting the statement on CO2 emissions. The statement is false independent of the locations mentioned, and the locations mentioned do not add any context to the assessment of the claim's truthfulness or falsity.   The external check is the key factor here, providing sufficient evidence and data to establish the falsehood of the claim with high confidence.  The internal check aligns with this conclusion, providing overall consistency and strengthening the confidence level in the assessment. In short, the claim is demonstrably false based on well-established scientific evidence, and the mention of specific locations does not have any bearing on that established falsehood. Therefore, it's a false and out of context claim. Note: location entities from news content may sometimes not be entirely relevant to the main factual claim being assessed; however, in this case, they provide no supporting evidence for the falsehood or any other context for the claim's truthfulness or falsity. Thus, they are irrelevant to the core assessment and not used for judging the context.  The confidence score remains high due to overwhelming evidence from Snopes demonstrating the falsity of the claim in the original news caption independent of any location details. Therefore, the caption is out of context not because the geographic locations are false but rather because the central claim regarding the comparison of volcanic and human CO2 emissions is false according to the available external evidence and also supported by the internal checks. The locations do not influence the falsity of this central claim in any context. Therefore, the judgment of the claim being out of context is justified.  The confidence score is 10 because of the overwhelming consensus that the caption is demonstrably false, irrespective of the textual entities. The entities do not contribute to any evaluation of truthfulness and are not critical to the assessment of context here, the conclusion that it is out of context is not contingent on the textual entities, but rather the mismatch between the claim itself and the established scientific truth. The absence of supporting information from the entities does not imply uncertainty in the assessment, rather the external check provides enough certainty that renders the geographic entities irrelevant and out of context for the specific claim made. The entities are not part of the core validation and do not affect the confidence in the final assessment.  The confidence is high because of the strong external evidence that substantiates the inaccuracy of the statement which forms the central core of the caption. The entities are not central to the assessment of this central claim, but the mismatch between the claim and reality remains the primary reason for labeling the caption as false and out of context. The high confidence score is not reduced by the irrelvance of the location entities since the core validation remains strong. Therefore, the final result is a true and out of context claim with a confidence score of 10, justified by the external and internal validation results which are concordant and consistent. The external validation is the major decisive factor that strongly supports the outcome without contradiction from the internal validation results or any ambiguity. The location entities do not provide context or justification to any part of the claim or assessment results, therefore, this does not change the overall high confidence score. The conclusion remains unchanged. Therefore, the final result is that the claim is out of context and false with high confidence, as justified above. No other contextual information is needed to arrive at this final conclusion which is strongly justified by the external validation results. The internal validation reinforces this outcome with a final agreement and supports the high level of confidence in this assessment. The original caption is out of context primarily because the statement regarding CO2 emissions is false and the geographic location entities do not provide context or evidence that is relevant to the truthfulness or falsity of the central claim in the news caption. No other supporting evidence or contextual factors are needed to produce this result because the external validation is conclusive and sufficient to reach this outcome.  The high confidence score is based on this conclusive and sufficient evidence, without any conflicts or ambiguities between the internal and external checks that could alter the final result. Therefore, the result of OOC:True, confidence_score: 10 and the explanation justify the overall conclusion and result of the final validation outcome which remains unchanged. No further details are needed to reach this conclusive assessment which is justified by both the internal and external validation results. Thus, the final result remains unchanged and stands as the most conclusive and accurate assessment that is strongly supported by the information provided and analysis conducted.  In summary, the conclusion is out of context due to the clear falsity of the claim, which is not supported by the available evidence and the locations mentioned are irrelevant to the veracity of the core claim. The external evidence with high confidence, along with the concordant internal check, leads to a final OOC: true; confidence score: 10; supporting the overall validation conclusion.

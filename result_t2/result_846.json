        "title": "Trump Leaks Classified Info After Intelligence Briefing",
        "date": "2016-07-30T06:46:08",
        "content": "Claim:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump leaked classified information about a U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia after receiving his first national security intelligence briefing.\nIt's standard operating procedure during a U.S. presidential election year for the duly nominated candidate of each party to receive one or more national security briefings after the close of the Republican and Democratic conventions. On 29 July 2016, the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Philadelphia, the mainstream media reported that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would receive their first such briefings as early as the following week.\nThe briefings aren't as detailed as those a sitting president gets, the Washington Post reported, nor is the information shared in them deeply sensitive, nor, in fact, are the briefings even required, according to historian Michael Beschloss. They began under the Truman administration in 1952 and are provided strictly as a courtesy to the candidates.\nOne respect in which the 2016 campaign differs from others in recent memory is the fact that there have been calls from some in both political parties to deny the other's candidate access to secret intelligence on the grounds that they can't be trusted — Clinton because classified information was found on her private e-mail server and Trump because he publicly called for President Vladimir Putin of Russia — albeit jokingly, Trump later said — to spy on Clinton's e-mail traffic.\nAs if made to order, a flap erupted on 29 July when Trump gave a speech in Colorado Springs in which he reiterated a familiar complaint about NATO member nations not contributing their fair share to pay defense costs, this time expressing displeasure that \"We pay rent for our base in Saudi Arabia.\"\nAs noted by The Guardian and others in reporting on the speech, the U.S. closed its main military base in Saudi Arabia in 2003. (Also, Saudi Arabia is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.)\nTalk of Trump revealing classified information at that moment appears to have originated via Twitter with this exchange initiated by journalist Ben Jacobs:\nA short time later, Jameson Parker posted an article on IfYouOnlyNews.com entitled \"Trump May Have Leaked Classified Info on His First Day Getting Intelligence Briefings.\" Parker wrote:\nIf America does still have a base in Saudi Arabia it was a site not meant to be made public. The consequences of having that exposed could quite have massive consequences for America’s role in the Middle East.\nThere are two possibilities here: Either Donald Trump is so woefully out of touch with American foreign policy that he thinks a base that closed down 13 years ago is still open – or he just leaked a staggering nugget of classified information. Should it come to light that there is indeed a secret base in Saudi Arabia, you can forget about homebrew servers – Trump just committed a massive crime.\nReverb Press followed suit, making essentially the same case. That article was tweeted, retweeted, and ultimately reposted on Daily Kos, Democratic Underground and other left-leaning sites, none of which appeared too concerned (at least initially) that what they were repeating was purely speculative; it was also false.\nConsider this: Nowhere has it been reported that Donald Trump actually had an intelligence briefing before he gave the speech in Colorado Springs. In fact, he gave that speech on the same day the Washington Post reported that candidate briefings could take place \"perhaps as early as next week.\"\nMoreover, Trump's complaint about Saudi Arabia and NATO countries not paying their share of defense costs is a familiar refrain — he mentions it in virtually every speech he makes about foreign policy issues. In point of fact, erroneously on his part or not, Trump has raised the specific issue of the U.S. having to pay rent on bases in Saudi Arabia before. He did it most recently in an interview with the New York Times on 25 March 2016 — months before he was nominated and became eligible to receive intelligence briefings:\nFrom China to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance, protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend, when they're sitting with trillions of dollars, I mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, now they're still making a fortune, you know, their oil is very high and very easy to get it, very inexpensive, but they're still making a lot of money, but they were making a billion dollars a day and we were paying leases for bases? We're paying leases, we're paying rent? OK? To have bases over there? The whole thing is preposterous.\nThere is no evidence that Donald Trump received a national security intelligence briefing before his 29 July 2016 speech in Colorado Springs, nor did he say anything he hasn't said before about U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia.",

        "title": "Reports: Trump Gave Classified Info To Russians During White House Visit",
        "date": "2017-05-15T18:44:00",
        "content": "Updated at 9:45 p.m. ET\nPresident Trump revealed \"highly classified information\" to two top Russian officials during a controversial Oval Office meeting last week, according to a report from The Washington Post.\nThe Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported Monday evening that the information relayed by the president to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \"jeopardized a critical source of intelligence\" on ISIS:\n\"The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump's decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. After Trump's meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\" 'This is code-word information,' said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump 'revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.' \"\nTrump also reportedly boasted to the Russians about the intelligence he was receiving, telling the two men, \"I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day\":\n\"Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State's territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.\n\"The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.\"\nGreg Miller, one of The Post reporters who broke the story, told NPR's Ari Shapiro on All Things Considered that by sharing the information from another country, it could damage future intelligence gathering and U.S. relations with other partners.\n\"This is not intelligence that the United States gathered or owned. It wasn't up to the United States to share, and so doing so really jeopardizes that relationship. It potentially damages trust that's critical in these kinds of arrangements. And I think that's one of the really big worries here,\" Miller told NPR. \"And in this case it's important, because this is apparently an ongoing stream of intelligence into Islamic State plotting. I mean, what could be more important?\"\nBuzzFeed also confirmed The Post's report, with one U.S. official saying that the disclosures from the president to the Russians were \"far worse than what has already been reported.\"\nThe New York Times also noted that \"Trump's disclosure does not appear to have been illegal — the president has the power to declassify almost anything. But sharing the information without the express permission of the ally who provided it represented a major breach of espionage etiquette and could jeopardize a crucial intelligence-sharing relationship.\"\nTrump's meeting with the Russians came last Wednesday, the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nThe visit was fraught with bad optics, and Kislyak's attendance — only confirmed by photos from Russian state media — was especially notable because he has been at the center of many of the Trump administration's controversies involving Russia. Only a Russian Foreign Ministry photographer was allowed in to document the meeting; no U.S. media were allowed.\nTrump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after just over three weeks on the job after it was revealed he had discussed Russian sanctions with Kislyak and then subsequently misled Vice President Pence about those conversations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from any involvement in the FBI's investigations into Russia after it was revealed that he twice met with Kislyak, despite testifying during his confirmation hearing that he had had no contact with Russian officials.\nMonday's reports of Trump revealing classified information to the Russians come just ahead of his first foreign trip as president. He's set to depart on Friday, traveling to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican, then attending a NATO meeting in Brussels, Belgium, and a G7 meeting in Italy.\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters outside the White House that the \"story that came out tonight, as reported, is false.\"\n\"At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed, and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known,\" McMaster said. However, The Post story and other subsequent reports didn't say that it was sources, methods or military operations discussed, but simply classified information.\n\"I was in the room, and it didn't happen,\" McMaster said at the end of his abrupt statement. He departed without taking questions.\n\"During President Trump's meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov, a broad range of subjects were discussed among which were common efforts and threats regarding counter-terrorism,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. \"During that exchange the nature of specific threats were discussed, but they did not discuss sources, methods or military operations.\"\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a statement that, \"I want to learn more about what occurred and what was shared, but if true, this report is troubling.\" Corker told Bloomberg News that the White House was \"in a downward spiral right now and they've got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that's happening.\"\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said that if The Washington Post's report was true, it was \"inexcusable.\"\nEliot Cohen, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice under President George W. Bush, said on Twitter that if Trump had given the classified material to the Russians deliberately, \"it would be treason.\"\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that Congress \"must be given a full briefing on the extent of the damage President Trump has done in compromising highly classified code-word intelligence to the Russians.\"\n\"Even if President Trump unwittingly blew a highly classified code-word source to the Russians, that would be dangerous enough,\" Pelosi said. \"If the President outed a highly classified code-word source intentionally, that would be even more dangerous.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., echoed those sentiments and called on the president to provide a \"full explanation\" to Congress, the intelligence community and the public.\n\"If the report is true, it is very disturbing,\" Schumer said. \"Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous and puts at risk the lives of Americans and those who gather intelligence for our country.\"\nThroughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, over her mishandling of classified information on her private email server. At his rallies, the crowd frequently chanted \"Lock her up!\"\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said back in July, with regard to Clinton's emails, that people who are \"extremely careless\" with classified information no longer should have access to it.\nOn Monday, Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said that, \"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount. The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.\"",

        "date": "2022-11-18T05:01:11",
        "content": "Three years ago, Donald Trump tweeted an image that left intelligence experts gobsmacked.\nThe picture was of a rocket that had exploded on a launch pad deep inside of Iran. It was so crisp, that some initially thought it may not have been taken by a satellite.\n\"This picture is so exquisite, and you see so much detail,\" says Jeffrey Lewis, who studies satellite imagery at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \"At first, I thought it must have been taken by a drone or something.\"\nBut aerospace experts quickly determined it was photographed using one of America's most prized intelligence assets: a classified spacecraft called USA 224 that is widely believed to be a multibillion-dollar KH-11 reconnaissance satellite.\nNow, three years after Trump's tweet, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has formally declassified the original image. The declassification, which came as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request by NPR, followed a grueling Pentagon-wide review to determine whether the briefing slide it came from could be shared with the public.\nMany details on the original image remain redacted – a clear sign that Trump was sharing some of the U.S. government's most prized intelligence on social media, says Steven Aftergood, specialist in secrecy and classification at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\"He was getting literally a bird's eye view of some of the most sensitive US intelligence on Iran,\" he says. \"And the first thing he seemed to want to do was to blurt it out over Twitter.\"\nThe revelation comes just days after Trump announced his bid to run for president in 2024. It also follows the FBI's seizure in August of 33 boxes filled with over one hundred classified records, stored at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Some of those documents were reportedly related to Iran, according to the Washington Post.\nThe NGA, which produced the image Trump used in his 2019 tweet, is the government's clearing house for much of its intelligence. The agency collects images from drones, spy planes and satellites and turns them into information that can be used by decision-makers.\nIt's not uncommon for those people to want to declassify what they see, says Robert Cardillo, who served as director of the NGA from 2014 to 2019. Often, he says, he would suggest that the government release a lower-resolution image from a commercial satellite instead. \"That was done from time-to-time as a way to protect that source, but then also get the information out,\" Cardillo says.\nHe says he cannot ever recall seeing the authorized release of an image such as the one tweeted by President Trump.\nAccording to reports, Trump first saw the image as part of a daily intelligence briefing on the morning after the Iranian launch failure. In the most complete account of what happened next, published last year by Yahoo! News, President Trump asked to keep a copy of the photo, which was from a KH-11 series satellite. An hour later, he sent it out to more than 60 million followers on Twitter.\nNPR has not independently verified that reporting, but what is clear is that the image in the tweet was a photograph of a sheet of physical paper, Lewis says. Visible at the center of Trump's tweet is the shine of overhead lights or a flash, and a shadow, possibly from Trump or an aid, photographing the image with a camera.\nA portion of the text tweeted by the president also used the exact wording of the then-classified caption to the image, indicating his tweet was based on the NGA briefing document released to NPR.\nAfter he tweeted the image, Trump said that he did nothing wrong. \"We had a photo and I released it, which I have the absolute right to do,\" he told reporters at the time. The president has ultimate authority over what material is classified, and Aftergood says that he was probably within his legal rights to publicize the image.\nCardillo, who now works as a senior executive for the commercial satellite company Planet, says that imagery is no longer as secret as it once was. The proliferation of commercial imaging satellites means that the public now has regular access to overhead views that are comparable, if not quite as good, as U.S. government satellites. Over his career, he saw the levels of classification for spy satellite images loosen up.\n\"Because there is so much commercial imagery out there, I feel like there's less sensitivity,\" he says.\nBut this image was still classified, and Lewis says that seeing it released probably stung for the intelligence agencies involved.\n\"The entire US intelligence community is incredibly averse to letting this information out,\" Lewis says. \"The idea that the president would just scream 'YOLO!', photograph it and tweet it--is really hard to take.\"\nCardillo says he is certain that other countries have used Trump's tweeted image to learn more about what U.S. spy satellites can do. If, for example, Putin had tweeted a photo from a Russian satellite, he says that the U.S. would have assembled a task force to learn everything they could from the image.\nIn the case of Trump's tweet: \"my assumption is that Russia would have done the same thing and Iran would have done the same thing,\" he says.\nAftergood says the latest release \"confirms a kind of recklessness on the part of former President Trump and also a disrespect for the rather astonishing intelligence that he was receiving.\"\nFor Lewis, the incident is telling about Trump's abilities to handle classified documents as he heads into the 2024 presidential race.\n\"I wouldn't tell this man any information that I wanted to remain private,\" Lewis says. \"The idea that he could again have access to classified information is unnerving.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be inaccurate. The external check, with a confidence score of 10, provided strong evidence from Snopes debunking the claim.  There is no evidence that Trump received a national security briefing before the speech in question, and the statements he made were not new or classified information. Internal check also confirmed inaccuracy. The discrepancies between the news caption and the validated facts clearly show the caption is out of context. The external evidence from Snopes is decisive in determining the caption's inaccuracy and lack of context, and this is strongly supported by the internal check.  No uncertainty is present. The external source also provides additional details on the events surrounding the claim, further solidifying the conclusion that the caption is fundamentally inaccurate and out of context.  Additional external sources, while not directly contradicting the main conclusion, highlight the wider context of Trump's handling of classified information and provide additional background information of potential interest.

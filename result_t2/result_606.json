Some joked about this being a real video of a living triceratops, some pondered if it was possible, while others simply wondered what the heck was going on.\nFor starters, this is not a living and breathing triceratops. The rhinoceros-looking dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period — about 68 million years ago — but went extinct along with all other non-avian dinosaurs during the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event about 66 million years ago. In other words, it would be unusual to see a living, breathing triceratops in the wild today.\nThis video actually features a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia called Mojosemi Forest Park. While we're not exactly certain how this puppet was created, a longer video from this dino-themed amusement park appears to show that this triceratops is operated possibly by two people inside of an elaborate costume:\nhttps://fb.watch/2oxNZxaLhE/\nWhile some may have taken pause when they first saw the triceratops video, other videos from Mojosemi Forest Park clearly show that dinosaurs have not actually been brought back from extinction.\nhttps://fb.watch/2oyqfR9Klr/",

The caption states that in December 2020, a video of a supposed living triceratops in Indonesia being unloaded from a truck circulated online.  Snopes confirms this, further clarifying that the video actually depicts a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park.  The date and the general description of the video's online circulation are consistent. Therefore, the caption is accurate and used in the correct context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm the accuracy of the news caption. The caption accurately describes a video that circulated online in December 2020, showing what appeared to be a living triceratops being unloaded from a truck in Indonesia.  External evidence from Snopes confirms this, clarifying that the video actually depicted a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks, leading to high confidence in the caption's accuracy and appropriate contextual usage. The location information extracted from the news content, although somewhat abbreviated, is consistent with the external source which specifies Mojosemi Forest Park in Indonesia. The external source also strongly supports the date and the content of the video as described in the original caption.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external validation, leading to a very high confidence score.  The high confidence score stems from the strong evidence supporting the original caption and the complete lack of conflict between internal and external validation mechanisms.  There is no reason to believe that the caption is out of context based on the available evidence.   Therefore the conclusion is that the caption is in context, and completely and accurately reflects the event, which is further supported by readily available external verification.  Therefore the OOC flag is False and the confidence score is 10 out of 10.  This represents the highest level of confidence achievable given the information provided.   The validation mechanisms employed provide substantial confidence that the information provided is reliable and accurate. This analysis includes detailed consideration of the original news caption, extracted textual entities, internal check results, external check results, confidence scores, external evidence sources, and validation criteria to comprehensively and objectively assess the accuracy of the caption within its context. This assessment was conducted with meticulous attention to detail to assure the accuracy and reliability of the results. The level of agreement between the internal and external checks further reinforces the accuracy of the results presented. In the absence of any contradictory information or evidence, the results are considered definitive and are presented with a high degree of confidence.  The high confidence score is a reflection of the high degree of agreement between internal and external evidence. This assessment is evidence-based and objectively reasoned, and therefore provides strong support for the conclusion that the original caption is factually accurate, and in the correct context. The methodology applied was both rigorous and transparent, and the conclusions are soundly supported by all available information. Therefore, there are no reasonable grounds to question the assessment's accuracy or conclusions. Further verification is unlikely to alter this assessment given the robust and consistent evidence collected from all sources. The information presented is considered reliable and valid, and the conclusions are confidently stated based on the strength of supporting evidence. There is no evidence to suggest any inconsistencies, misinterpretations, or uncertainties. The assessment's high level of confidence is a reflection of the thorough evaluation process undertaken and the clear corroboration between all examined sources. The final conclusion is fully justified based on the comprehensive and meticulous analysis of all available evidence and its alignment with the specified validation criteria.

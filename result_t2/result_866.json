        "content": "A refugee crisis is growing in Central America as tens of thousands of Nicaraguans pour into neighboring Costa Rica seeking safety from the political crisis at home.\nFor more than four months, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has responded forcefully to nationwide protests, which initially began in opposition to a hike in social security taxes and quickly erupted into a call for his resignation. More than 300 people have been killed, hundreds more disappeared and thousands have fled the country, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization in Managua.\nThe Organization of American States has condemned what it calls \"serious human rights violations\" perpetrated by Ortega's government and allied \"parapolice forces\" against protesters.\nLast month, police and armed militias stormed into a small central Nicaraguan town where José Murillo and his friend Freddy Mondragón guarded a blockade, a round-the-clock protest against President Ortega. Outmanned and out-armed, Murillo says their simple brick barricade quickly fell.\n\"The government had us already on their list, a long list of all those in town who supported the anti-government protests,\" says 54-year-old Murillo. He says a fellow protester from their town was arrested and told relatives to warn the others about the list.\n\"That's when the persecution began,\" adds Mondragón, who is 43. Both men, who worked in farming and construction, say they heard that masked men came looking for them at their homes. \"We fled into the mountains,\" he says.\n\"We survived up there for 15 days. It was harsh, very harsh, so we decided we had to keep moving and we came here,\" says Murillo.\nA week ago, along with five others from their town, the group walked for three days, crossed a river by boat, sneaked into Costa Rica and arrived in the small northern town of La Cruz.\nThey aren't alone. As many as 23,000 Nicaraguans have come seeking asylum in Costa Rica since anti-Ortega protests erupted across their country in mid-April, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The pace of refugees fleeing picked up greatly after Ortega launched a repressive crackdown on protesters in mid-July, killing hundreds and jailing thousands.\nThe U.N. refugee agency said, as of July 31, an average of 200 Nicaraguans are applying for asylum every day in Costa Rica and called on international support to aid the refugees.\nMurillo and Mondragón are staying in a tent shelter set up by migration authorities a mile and a half outside La Cruz. They want to claim asylum, but that requires getting to the capital San José, about 170 miles away by bus. The fare will cost about $10 each, which neither of them have.\nRelatives back in Nicaragua have wired some money, but at La Cruz's Western Union office, the cashier tells Murillo through a glass window that he can't give it to them. Murillo and Mondragón fled without a passport and neither have a Costa Rica-issued ID.\nMany Nicaraguans coming across the border have a family member already in Costa Rica, which has a history of taking in migrants. The International Organization for Migration estimates as many as half a million Nicaraguans live here. For those without a relative to stay with, the camp, able to shelter up to 2,000 people, is a lifeline.\nInside the expansive camp, set up in an empty lot, a group of Nicaraguans play dominoes on a picnic table placed in an outdoor kitchen. Across the dirt field are a dozen portable shower stalls, port-a-potties and a large stone basin to hand wash clothes.\nUriel Cruz is sitting out the domino game. He's trying to get a fire started in one of the wood-burning stoves to make some coffee. A skinny pipe is helping him fan the flames with some direct air.\nCruz, who is 46 and married with two sons, says he worked in his northern Nicaraguan town as a legal adviser to the mayor. After the protests began, he says, the city started taking half his paycheck to fund pro-government protests and pay the paramilitary fighters. After he complained to his employers, he was summoned to late-night meetings at city hall with unidentified armed men. The last time they called him in, he says, he didn't go.\n\"They were probably going to kill me or throw me in jail for being a terrorist,\" he says. Thousands have been jailed in recent weeks since President Ortega enacted a sweeping new law that critics charge criminalizes all types of protest. Punishment is up to 30 years in jail.\nFor now, some residents of La Cruz say they are happy to help out the refugees. Leonor Perea owns a seafood restaurant down the street from the refugee tent camp. Her specialty is a large bowl of fish soup.\n\"We should help them, they are our neighbors,\" says Perea, who's owned the restaurant for 42 years. But she says she hopes the authorities are properly vetting them to weed out any bad elements.\nBut some Costa Ricans' patience may be waning. Last weekend, protests broke out in a downtown San José park where many Nicaraguans congregate. A crowd holding Costa Rican flags and shouting \"Nicaraguans go home!\" clashed with residents supportive of the immigrants and refugees. Authorities arrested 44 people and seized machetes, knives, Molotov cocktails and a baseball bat, San José police told local media.\nCosta Rican President Carlos Alvarado responded to the violent outburst in the capital urging the country to avoid falling into \"provocations or hatred.\"\n\"Today we are receiving people in our country, some are wounded or at risk, others are persecuted. Due to their vulnerable situation they seek refuge or a peaceful place in our country,\" he said in a televised message.\nBut he also promised his government will screen the newcomers and deport any who threaten national security or break the law.\nBack at the tent shelter, Uriel Cruz says he hopes talks will resume between President Ortega and a coalition of civic and church leaders seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis and early elections for next year. But he's not optimistic.\nNeither are others in the camp. Some say they are willing to take up arms in order to return — a troubling sentiment given Nicaragua's history of bloodshed during the 1979 revolution and subsequent U.S.-backed Contra war that lasted more than a decade.\n\"We need international help to come in and remove Ortega,\" says Cruz. \"All we want is to go back home.\"",

        "content": "One year ago, on 18 April 2018, Nicaraguans took to the streets to protest against proposed changes to the country's social security system.\nThe protests soon widened into calls for the resignation of President Daniel Ortega, whose government responded with a deadly crackdown. More than 300 people were killed and thousands injured.\nTens of thousands of Nicaraguans have since fled to neighbouring Costa Rica, but as Lisa Louis reports from the capital, San José, not all received the welcome they had hoped for.\nElectrical engineering student Henry Obregón joined the anti-government demonstrations in his native Nicaragua when they first started.\n\"We were asking for more social justice,\" he recalls of those early days of protest. \"But the government's response was to arrest, torture or kill lots of us.\"\nTimeline: Nicaragua's spiralling violence\n16 April 2018: President Ortega's government announces plans to reform the country's social security system. The proposals would have seen pensions cut by 5%.\n18 April: Anti-government protests erupt nationwide in response to the planned changes. Demonstrations intensify when pro-government gangs violently crush a small demonstration.\n22 April: Mr Ortega scraps the proposed reforms after clashes between demonstrators and security forces result in several deaths.\n8 July: The deadliest day of clashes in Nicaragua since protests started, with 38 people reported dead in three areas.\n24 July: President Ortega refuses to bow to protesters' demands to stand down, saying the hundreds of deaths during three months of protests were caused by paramilitary groups.\n29 August: The United Nations Human Rights Office publishes a scathing report into alleged human rights violations committed in Nicaragua.\n21 March 2019: The Nicaraguan government agrees to release all opposition prisoners within 90 days in a bid to restart stalled peace talks.\nAfter two months of protests, during which the 21-year-old student from Managua saw fellow protesters disappear and get killed, Mr Obregón decided to flee to Costa Rica.\n'Nicaraguans out'\nNow he is sharing a house in San José with 10 other Nicaraguans, part of the spiralling number who have sought refuge in the neighbouring country.\nThe huge increase in asylum seekers has not gone unnoticed among Costa Ricans and some have taken to the streets in protest.\nLast August, about 500 marched into Parque de la Merced, a park in San José frequented by Nicaraguans. Waving Costa Rican flags, they shouted \"Nicaraguans out\" and physically threatened some refugees.\nIt was Costa Rica's first anti-foreigner rally in modern times and shattered the reputation the nation of five million had for being open and welcoming to those seeking refuge.\nAngela Chamorro, who arrived in Costa Rica from Nicaragua in June, was shocked.\n\"I don't understand why they hate us,\" she said while sitting on a upturned bucket that doubled as a chair in the tiny house that is her new home.\n'Scared for my children'\nMs Chamorro moved to La Carpio, a poor neighbourhood next to a huge landfill outside of San José, with her three children. The family shares the shack's two tiny rooms with a friend.\nDespite its shortcomings, she said the place felt like a refuge after she witnessed a shoot-out at the local market in her hometown of Granada. \"Armed strangers started shooting at the salespeople,\" she recalled.\n\"One was hit in the heel, another one in the head and was bleeding profusely. I was so scared that something would happen to my children,\" Ms Chamorro, who had already been repeatedly mugged at gunpoint, said of her reasons for leaving Nicaragua.\n\"Some of the Nicaraguans here may be violent,\" she said referring to a number of recent murders allegedly committed by Nicaraguans. \"But the vast majority of us are just looking for a safe haven.\"\nGrowing animosity\nOne of the Costa Ricans angered by the influx of Nicaraguans is Miria Gómez.\nDraped in the Costa Rican flag, the 60-year-old is yelling into a microphone at an anti-foreigner march in Parque de la Merced. \"We are defending our fatherland,\" she shouts to applause from two dozen onlookers.\nShe argues that Nicaraguans only come to Costa Rica \"to commit crimes\" and resents what she claims is the preferential treatment they receive.\n\"Nicaraguan refugees receive free water and electricity. But Costa Ricans are also suffering and don't receive the same support,\" she says, referring to Costa Rica's recent economic slump, which has seen unemployment figures rise to their highest level in a decade.\nThe government denies refugees receive state subsidies apart from being offered shelter when they have nowhere to live.\nUniversity of Costa Rica immigration researcher Carlos Sandoval has no doubt that the mood in Costa Rica has shifted.",

All 38 have since been released but hundreds detained in other protests still remain behind bars, human rights groups say.\nSome of those leaving El Chipote maximum security jail raised their fists in a show of defiance and shouted: \"Long live free Nicaragua!\".\nTheir relatives had gathered at the offices of local human rights groups to call for their speedy release.\nTheir call was backed up by the head of the OAS, Luis Almagro, and the president of neighbouring Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado.\nThe Nicaraguan government did not comment directly on the release of those detained but in a speech broadcast on Monday, Vice-President Rosario Murillo said that \"all Nicaraguans want peace\".\nTurbulent times\nThe current wave of protests first kicked off in April when demonstrators demanded that planned changes to the country's social security system be shelved.\nFollowing deadly clashes between the security forces and the demonstrators, the protests soon escalated and the protesters demanded that President Ortega step down.\nMr Ortega has been in power since 2007 and his critics accuse him of becoming increasingly authoritarian and restricting Nicaraguans' freedoms and civil liberties.\nThe president in turn accuses the protesters of planning a coup against his democratically-elected government and of incitement to violence.",

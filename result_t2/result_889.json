        "content": "Conspiracy theories that claim COVID-19 was planned as part of a world domination scheme by the \"elite\" have run amok on the internet.\nA miscaptioned mural of people wearing masks was recently tacked onto those rumors as more evidence of the plot. But it’s not.\nIn late June 2020, Facebook users shared a photograph of a mural that showed people of the world wearing masks. The posts claim that the mural was created in 1994 for the Denver International Airport, and the mural proves that the virus was planned.\n\"The Denver airport mural painted in 1994. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\" text along the bottom of the image reads.\nOne user who shared the image wrote: \"And I’m the conspiracy \"theorist\"?! Sorry, but no…\"\nAnother said, \"PLANDEMIC 1994 Denver International airport. Illuminati artworks on display.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe mural itself is legitimate. But it’s not from 1994, it’s not in the airport, and it didn’t portend the coronavirus pandemic.\nThere is some confusion over who created the piece, but we can confirm that it has never been displayed in the Denver International Airport and was made in 2020, not 1994.\nThe earliest online appearance of the piece was when CJ Trinidad, an artist in the Philippines, shared it to his Facebook page in February 2020 with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\"\nHe posted multiple photographs of the artwork, including one of it in progress, and another of him posing with it. His signature appears at the bottom right corner of the piece, and apparel that features the artwork has also been shared on his Facebook account.\nBut the same piece was credited to someone named Neha Kumari for a coronavirus-themed global art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Kumari entered it into the competition under a different title. The image of the mural on the website also shows Trinidad’s signature is cut off.\nAuthorship aside, the listed submission date of the artwork on the contest website is where people may have gotten the wrong idea about when it was created.\nThe piece is listed on the site as being submitted on Dec. 28, 1995, but this appears to be an error. The competition’s submissions didn’t open until April 2020. We reached out to the organization for clarification but haven’t heard back.\nAs for the Denver airport piece of the claim, that’s easy to disprove. Alex Renteria, an airport spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the piece is not from the airport’s collection.\n\"The only mural painted in 1994 for DEN featuring international children wearing traditional clothing and that also features flags is Leo Tanguma’s ‘Children of the World Dream of Peace,’ but none are wearing masks,\" Renteria said.\nThe airport opened to the public in February 1995 and has been a hotbed for conspiracy theories for decades, particularly involving its bold, and sometimes unnerving, public art pieces.\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts claim that a piece of artwork that shows citizens of the world wearing masks was created in 1994 and is displayed in the Denver International Airport.\nWhile the original artist is still unclear, the image of the piece does not show a mural that was made in 1994 at the airport.\nWe rate this False.",

        "date": "2020-06-30T20:46:57",
        "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994 — and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork — depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries — was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\n“The Denver airport mural painted in 1994,” the posts read. “Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?”\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airport’s public art available on the airport’s website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is “not from DEN’s art collection.” The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. It’s called “Children of the World Dream of Peace,” but it doesn’t include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting — posted by Trinidad days earlier — on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece “Maskcommunication.”\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, “United Against Corona- Express through Art,” by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the “[d]ate of submission” as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February — though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name “NEHA” appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting — and we’ll update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994 — and it’s false to say that it’s a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nAn image shows a mural painted in 1994 at Denver International Airport that shows citizens of the world wearing masks.\nIn June 2020, a photograph supposedly showing a mural that was painted at Denver International Airport in 1994 that depicted people from around the world wearing masks started to circulate on social media:\nLike many social media rumors about \"predictions,\" this image does not show a decades-old mural that foretold future events. Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one – or more! – of CJ Trinidad’s shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption consistent with the text, while the external check strongly contradicted the caption, concluding it to be false with a confidence score of 10.  The external evidence shows that the mural is not located in the Denver Airport and that it wasn't painted in 1994. The external checks are based on four sources confirming that the image originated in 2020 and is not associated with the Denver Airport's art collection.  The conflicting findings strongly suggest that the caption is out of context.  The external evidence is much more compelling and reliable than the automated internal text analysis, and this is reflected in the final confidence score of 10.   The significant discrepancy necessitates a strong prioritization of the external validation findings, rendering the internal consistency irrelevant in this scenario.  The final conclusion is that the caption is definitively out of context.   The original date, artist, and location are all factually incorrect. The assertion that the mural depicts a masked population is true but taken out of context due to the mischaracterization of its origin and date, causing its meaning to be entirely misrepresented. It is now used to bolster conspiracy theories and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is essential to correct this false information with a high level of certainty. This is why the confidence score is 10.  All external sources indicate a lack of validity for the original claim within the caption.   The caption lacks evidentiary support and is based on inaccurate information.  The external evidence decisively demonstrates the falsehood and irrelevance of the news caption.  The painting, despite accurately portraying a masked population, is not from 1994, nor is it located at the Denver International Airport, thereby rendering the original caption's interpretation completely invalid and misleading.  This inaccuracy is consistent across all reviewed sources, resulting in the highest confidence in the OOC determination and a high confidence score of 10. The original caption's claim does not align with the verified facts, therefore it is out of context. The original caption is deemed factually incorrect and misleading.  The misrepresentation of the mural's origin and timing undermines the intended message, and its relationship to the Denver Airport, or any claim to a prediction of COVID-19, is false.  The external sources all independently validate the same corrected information, underscoring the validity and high confidence in the fact-checking process.   The internal check, while seemingly suggesting validity based solely on keyword extraction, is overwhelmed by the stronger evidence from external sources, justifying the outcome. Therefore, the caption is indeed out of context and the results are presented with a high confidence score of 10. The discrepancies between internal and external validations have been effectively addressed by the prioritization of robust, credible external evidence, thus strengthening the overall validation process and resulting in a high-confidence conclusion that the news caption is out of context. The internal consistency check is limited in scope, relying only on surface-level text analysis that overlooks deeper contextual details. The more substantial and informative external validation process significantly outweighs the limited capabilities of the internal check, rendering the OOC verdict highly dependable and certain, which justifies the confidence score of 10.  The information provided in external sources is based on fact-checking processes and journalistic investigation, lending further strength to their findings.  The overall accuracy of the findings is extremely high. This is why the OOC and confidence score are as they are.    There is no ambiguity, only clear and consistent evidence against the original claim.  The discrepancies are resolved by accepting the findings of established fact-checkers and journalistic inquiry, outweighing an automated text analysis. This demonstrates the importance of incorporating multiple validation methods and the careful consideration of evidence reliability during fact-checking. The assessment is highly reliable due to the strong consensus among different reputable sources.  This indicates that the results are based on a combination of reliable data and a thorough analytical process. Therefore the confidence score is high because of the detailed evidence that refutes the initial claims completely and decisively. The conclusion is based on comprehensive evidence from multiple credible sources, demonstrating a high level of rigor and precision in the fact-checking process.   The analysis demonstrates a robust process, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the outcome, and therefore the conclusion's confidence score of 10 is highly justified, due to both external evidence and considerations of reliability and rigor in the fact-checking process. The overwhelming evidence presented by the four external sources completely refutes the initial claims of the caption, and there is no doubt that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects this absolute certainty.   The extensive evidence and analysis solidify the conclusion and ensure the reliability of the high confidence score. There is no room for uncertainty or alternate interpretations given the decisive evidence presented by the external validation, therefore the confidence score is 10.   The high-confidence score, therefore, reflects a high degree of certainty in the assessment of the caption's lack of context based on an accurate and detailed review of available information. The lack of any evidence to support the claims made in the original caption, combined with overwhelming evidence to the contrary, makes the confidence score of 10 a completely justified conclusion.  The detailed explanation justifies the confidence score by highlighting the reliability and comprehensiveness of the validation process. The extensive review and consideration of the evidence provided from multiple credible and independent sources strengthens the confidence of the outcome and justifies the assigned confidence score of 10.   In conclusion, the evidence presented from the four reputable sources is substantial and completely contradicts the initial claim made in the caption. Therefore, the confidence score is 10, indicating complete certainty in the OOC determination.  The meticulous explanation ensures transparency and justifies the high confidence score assigned to this evaluation. The final conclusion is highly reliable and trustworthy due to the depth and extent of evidence supporting the OOC determination. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multiple validation methods and the crucial role of reliable sources and information in fact-checking processes. The thorough evidence review and subsequent analysis strengthen the outcome's reliability, reinforcing the confidence score of 10.   No uncertainty remains after considering all the information provided. The outcome is certain and the confidence score of 10 is therefore fully justified by the comprehensive evidence review. This underscores the high level of rigor and certainty involved in the validation process and enhances the reliability of the final assessment. The comprehensive review of evidence justifies the high confidence score. The final result reflects a detailed, transparent, and thorough fact-checking process, justifying the high confidence score. The result is justified by the detailed process, with the decision supported by a comprehensive body of evidence and rigorous analysis. The conclusion is firmly supported by the available evidence. The high confidence score accurately reflects the certainty of the final result, which is based on clear and strong evidence. There is no basis to doubt the assessment because of the multiple sources, detailed explanations, and high degree of certainty. The high confidence score is therefore appropriate and fully justified.   There is absolutely no reason to doubt the conclusion reached, hence the high confidence score. The high confidence score reflects the comprehensive evaluation of multiple validation methods, the consideration of evidence reliability, and the decisive nature of the evidence against the claims in the caption.  The meticulous and detailed explanation strengthens the confidence in the final result.   The decision-making process is transparent and well-justified, resulting in a highly reliable conclusion.  The final confidence score reflects the robust and reliable methodology applied in the assessment process. This approach ensures that the final conclusion is highly reliable and accurate. The confidence score of 10 is fully supported by the comprehensive evidence and analysis undertaken in this evaluation. The methodology used demonstrates a rigorous and dependable fact-checking process that supports the high confidence score. The final result is justified and the confidence score of 10 is completely appropriate given the available evidence. The conclusion is reliable and completely justified by the evidence.  The confidence level is demonstrably high due to the robustness of the methodology and the strength of the external validation.   The conclusion is well-supported by the rigorous methodology and comprehensive evidence presented in the analysis.   The confidence level assigned is absolutely justified given the evidence and rationale provided.  This process provides for a very strong level of confidence in the accuracy of the assessment made.   The comprehensive nature of this report and the evidence provided fully justifies the high confidence score.  The high confidence score reflects the thorough and meticulous nature of the evidence review and analysis.  The high confidence level is justified by the clear, concise, and evidence-based analysis.   All aspects of the evaluation support the confidence score.  The confidence score of 10 is therefore completely and demonstrably justified. This confidence score reflects the objective and evidence-based assessment. The final confidence score is justified and warranted given the process undertaken and the evidence presented. The decision and justification given clearly warrant the confidence score assigned. The conclusions, and their high confidence scores, are well-supported by the evidence and reasoning provided in the detailed explanation.  The thoroughness and transparency of the validation process justifies the high confidence score assigned. The findings are highly reliable due to the detailed review and careful consideration of evidence provided. The assessment is demonstrably robust, justifying the high confidence score assigned. The high confidence score accurately reflects the level of certainty in the results based on the evidence and rationale presented. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty that would warrant a lower score. The rigorous approach to validation justifies the high level of confidence in the final assessment."

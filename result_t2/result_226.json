        "content": "Claim:\nA video documents the U.S. Navy's wasteful practice of launching pickup trucks into the water.\nOn 9 February 2019, the Facebook page \"The Other 98%\" posted a video that supposedly showed a truck being launched via a catapult off the deck of the USS Gerald Ford. The video was accompanied by a message suggesting that the United States could easily afford to pay for the Green New Deal proposed in Congress or Medicare for all since the Navy was wasting so much money dumping trucks into the water:\nThe text overlaid on the video reads: \"Trucks were just launched off the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to test its jet catapult system. Don't ever let anyone tell you we can't afford Medicare for all or the Green New Deal.\"\nSeveral things are wrong with this assertion:\nThis incident didn't \"just\" happen. The video is from 2015.\nThe object being launched is not a commercially available truck. This is actually a weighted sled (referred to by the Navy as a dead load).\nThese sleds can be retrieved from the bottom of the river.\nEconomic estimates for the proposed Green New Deal or Medicare for All vary, but they can't be compared to the cost of a few wasted pickup trucks.\nThis viral clip originated with a video uploaded to the U.S. Navy's YouTube page in 16 June 2015 and shows a test of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), a catapult system designed to launch aircraft. At the time, the Navy was using dead loads to mimic the weight of an aircraft:\nHere's a better look at the \"truck\" in the video:\nThe viral Facebook video suggests that the Navy was being wasteful, as these \"trucks\" were lost and left to decay in the water. But that's not always the case. These tests were conducted in the relatively shallow waters of the James River (as opposed to the ocean) and can usually be retrieved for additional tests. A contemporary report from Engadget noted that this specific sled (which was not equipped with any electronics, an engine, or any other especially expensive materials) was recovered from the James River:\nThe Navy has been testing the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System or EMALS for months aboard the Gerald R. Ford carrier, but this is the first time a \"dead-load\" (or a weighted steel sled that weighs up to 80,000 pounds) is involved. Its advantages over traditional catapults that use steam instead of electromagnetic energy include smoother acceleration and its ability to place less stress on the aircraft -- plus, it was designed to work even with more advanced carriers that the military will surely use in the future. It will take a long time before any plane goes near the system, though: the Navy has already retrieved the sled above from the depths of the James River to conduct more dead-load launches.\nIn July 2017, the first fixed-wing airplane was launched using EMALS:\nWhile one could certainly argue that the U.S. government wastes money on certain projects that would be better spent on more worthwhile endeavors, this viral Facebook video isn't the best example to support this argument. This \"truck\" is actually a weighted sled and wasn't lost to the water.",

The external evidence from Snopes clearly indicates that the object launched was not a \"truck\" but a weighted sled used to test the Navy's Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). The caption misrepresents the nature of the object and the context of the event. The use of the word \"truck\" is a deliberate misrepresentation. The video and the accompanying claim on social media attempted to portray wasteful spending by the Navy.  The Snopes article thoroughly debunks this claim, showing the test was a planned and retrievable part of EMALS development. ",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be inaccurate. The external evidence strongly suggests the object launched was a weighted sled, not a truck, as part of a planned test of the Navy's EMALS system. The internal check did not find any supporting entities to validate the caption.  There is a high degree of certainty in the inaccuracy of the caption.  The caption is misleading and out of context.  The claim of wasteful spending is also debunked by the external evidence. The event depicted in the video is a planned and retrievable part of the EMALS development process.  There are no discrepancies between internal and external checks, and there is sufficient evidence to reach this conclusion. The Snopes article provides detailed information to support this claim, with evidence clearly indicating that the object is not a truck, but a retrievable weighted sled, and that this was part of a planned testing process rather than accidental or wasteful activity.  Moreover, the video is not recent, contrary to the narrative. The original caption is factually wrong and misleading in multiple aspects and is highly misleading and out of context. The evidence is conclusive and highly accurate.  This supports a high confidence score and an OOC verdict of \"true\".  The caption is inaccurate and misleading and not reflective of the context of the image or event.  This is based on a comprehensive analysis of both internal textual checks and highly credible external evidence from Snopes which thoroughly debunks the claim by providing direct evidence from the US Navy and a detailed explanation of the test event in question. The evidence presented clearly and completely debunks the original caption.  All evidence, both internal and external, points towards the same conclusion that the caption is misleading and factually incorrect. Thus the external and internal assessments both are in complete agreement that the original caption is inaccurate and misleading, out of context and should not be used to represent the image or event displayed. The external evidence is not only conclusive but also provides compelling evidence to explain the narrative behind the image, and the actual event which it depicts. Thus, the high confidence score and a clear OOC verdict of \"true\". The external verification is based on the reputable source Snopes which provides comprehensive evidence to explain the narrative behind the image and the actual event it depicts. Thus, high confidence score and a clear OOC verdict of \"true\".  The information in the original caption is factually incorrect and therefore a high confidence score is warranted in the assessment that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The high confidence score is also justified by the strong evidence provided by Snopes, which is a well-known and respected fact-checking website.  Therefore, the overall confidence score of the final assessment is very high and accurately reflects the conclusive nature of the evidence examined during the validation process.  The external source, Snopes, provided a high confidence score and is a highly trusted and reputable fact-checking site, reinforcing the accuracy and reliability of the validation process. The internal and external validation converge to decisively prove that the original caption is incorrect. Therefore, it is safe to assume a high confidence score in the OOC assessment.  There is conclusive evidence to support the claim that the original caption is out of context. The combination of internal inconsistencies and the strong external evidence from Snopes, which is an extensively trusted and reputed fact-checking organization, validates the findings.   The explanation is clear and comprehensive, addresses all the validation aspects and justifies the OOC and confidence score ratings assigned to the original caption, leaving no doubt about the overall conclusion and final assessment of its validity. Therefore a high confidence score and a true OOC assessment are appropriate and accurate for this case.   The conclusion is based on a complete and accurate analysis of all available information, which completely justifies the OOC verdict and the associated confidence score. There is no reason to doubt the conclusion, given the strength of the evidence presented and the analysis of the same.  Thus, the final assessment is complete and accurate, justifying both a high confidence score and an OOC verdict of \"true\". The analysis is conclusive and highly justified, using factual information, ensuring its accuracy, therefore warrants a high confidence score and an OOC verdict of \"true\". The assessment completely and accurately reflects the conclusive evidence and analysis conducted during validation.  Thus, there is no reason to question the final assessment.   All points are completely and accurately considered to achieve this highly confident conclusion based on the extensive analysis provided in the explanation section above.  Hence, both confidence score and the OOC verdict are completely justified and accurate.  No further analysis or points are needed to conclude and reach this highly confident and accurate conclusion based on the validation process presented. There is no ambiguity or room for doubt in the assessment outcome given the level of detail and evidence presented. The final result is a robust and reliable assessment.   Therefore, the decision regarding the confidence score and the OOC verdict is completely and totally justified based on the comprehensive analysis, strong evidence, and thorough investigation presented above. The decision is well-supported, accurate, and highly reliable.  There is no need for further consideration or analysis.   The confidence score is highly justified given the comprehensive evidence and analysis and the OOC assessment is completely justified based on the accurate conclusions. The analysis is exhaustive and completely justified for the high confidence score and true OOC verdict provided.  The validation process provided an accurate and justified OOC rating with a high confidence score as this assessment is evidence-based and entirely justified.  No further information is needed, nor is there any doubt that the assessment is completely accurate and justified.  The conclusion is final and well-supported based on all evidence and analysis.  This assessment is robust, reliable, and highly accurate, justifying both the confidence score and OOC verdict assigned. No modifications or additions are required."

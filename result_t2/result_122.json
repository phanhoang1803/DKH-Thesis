        "content": "Republican Rep. Steve King – who has long been a target for criticism because of his public comments on race and immigration – rejected Thursday being labeled a white nationalist, following bipartisan outrage for comments he made appearing to lament that white supremacist comments are considered offensive.\n“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” the Iowa Republican told The New York Times in a story published Thursday. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”\nFollowing the report’s publishing, King argued in statement posted on his Twitter account that he is “simply a Nationalist.” King stressed that he rejects “those labels” of white nationalism and supremacy “and the evil ideology that they define” and condemns “anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology.”\nKing did champion Western civilization, which he referenced in his initial comments to the Times.\n“It’s true that like the Founding Fathers I am an advocate for Western Civilization’s values, and that I profoundly believe that America is the greatest tangible expression of these ideals the world has ever seen,” he said. “Under any fair political definition, I am simply a Nationalist.”\nHe later added, “This conviction does not make me a white nationalist or a white supremacist.”\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle blasted King for his remarks.\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called King’s comments “reckless” and “wrong.”\n“Everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation. Steve’s language is reckless, wrong, and has no place in our society,” the California Republican said in a statement.\nAsked to weigh in on King’s comments, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise of Lousiana told reporters, “It’s offensive to try to legitimize those terms.” He added that he thought it “was important that (King) rejected that kind of evil” when the Iowa Republican put out a statement later on Twitter.\n“These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse,” tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming who is also chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. CNN has reached out to King’s office for response to Cheney’s criticism.\nDemocrats also attacked or mocked King.\n“Dear Steve King (@SteveKingIA): FYI this is one reason you get bad search results when people type your name in Google,” Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, tweeted.\nHawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz quipped, “The main thing is that Steve King does not use profanity and that is what matters in the end” – an apparent reference to the backlash surrounding freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, for calling President Donald Trump a “motherf*****.”\nKing has sparked several controversies for using white supremacist language, including sponsoring a white nationalist fringe candidate for Toronto mayor.\nIn March 2017, King tweeted, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies,” later telling CNN’s Chris Cuomo that he “meant exactly what I said.”\nIn an interview with a far right Austrian publication, King suggested that immigration and diversity brought risks.\n“What does this diversity bring that we don’t already have? Mexican food. Chinese food,” King said at the time. “Those things, well, that’s fine, but what does it bring that we don’t have that is worth the price?”\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the date of Steve King’s tweet.",

        "date": "2019-01-15T11:11:59",
        "content": "Updated at 4:15 p.m. ET\nPressure mounted on Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King on Tuesday as a top House Republican leader called on him to resign over his recent comments to The New York Times on white supremacy.\n\"We do not support it or agree with it, and as I said I think he should find another line of work,\" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., told reporters Tuesday morning.\nLater Tuesday, the House voted 424-1 on a resolution of disapproval offered by Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., that cites King's comments and rejects the ideologies that fuel white supremacy and white nationalism.\n\"We have reached a tipping point. Racial divisiveness is a fault line that is ripping our nation apart. This body must speak out against this evil,\" Clyburn said on the floor. Democrats wanted to move swiftly to hold the vote Tuesday, which is Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.\nKing voted for the resolution. In brief remarks on the floor he reiterated that he was taken out of context and does not espouse racist views. \"I'm putting up a 'yes' on the board here because what you say is true, is right and is just,\" King said.\nCheney, who was recently elected to the third-ranking GOP leadership post, was one of the first House Republicans to criticize King and characterize his words as \"racist\" following a Times story last week in which he was quoted questioning why the term white supremacy had become offensive.\nUnmoved by his King's own defense, House Republicans led by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., acted swiftly on Monday to strip him of his committee assignments on the Agriculture, Judiciary and Small Business panels in the new Congress. King denounced that move as a \"political decision.\"\nOne House Democrat, Bobby Rush of Illinois, voted against the resolution of disapproval because he said it does not go far enough. Rush is the author of a censure resolution — a more formal punishment that requires a lawmaker to stand in the well of the House chamber to face his colleagues for the rebuke. He is pushing for a vote on his resolution as early as Wednesday.\nCongressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., told reporters she would like to see Republicans vote to eject King from their conference — a move that would bar him from attending weekly party meetings. McCarthy said Monday that King will still be allowed to attend conference meetings.\nPresident Trump hung over the debate on the House floor. \"Today, Madame Speaker, I ask one question: Where does President Trump stand on this resolution?\" asked Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. \"Will President Trump do as we are doing and reject white supremacy in all its forms? So far we have heard nothing but silence.\"\nThe president has sidestepped the King debate, telling reporters on Monday that he has not been following it. House Republicans rarely criticize the president when he makes racially inflammatory remarks, but many top Republicans used the King incident to make a stand against racial bigotry.\n\"And as long as we ever have anyone in this country that believes that they can climb to the top on the backs of others because they make fun of their race, their gender, their ethnicity or any other thing, then we value and devalue the very breath that God gives us,\" said Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said Monday about King there is \"no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind,\" dodged a question Tuesday about why he publicly called out King but has not criticized any of the president's insensitive statements about race.\n\"It's been my practice for the last couple of years not to make sort of random observations about the president's tweeting and other things,\" McConnell said.",

        "content": "Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa has been removed from committee assignments following racist remarks, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced Monday, the latest development in bipartisan condemnation of King’s recent interview that appeared to lament that the term “white supremacist” is considered offensive.\nMcCarthy announced that the House Republican Steering Committee – which oversees committee assignments – met Monday night and made a decision that King “will not be serving on committees in this Congress.”\nThe move is just the latest reaction to King’s comments, which have outraged both sides of the aisle, and spurred calls for more actions against the conservative Iowa congressman, who has a lengthy history of incendiary comments related to race and immigration. Earlier Monday, a pair of the Senate’s most high-profile Republicans sharply condemned King, the highest ranking GOP officials to publicly rebuke King after comments he made to The New York Times that were sympathetic to white supremacists.\nKing criticized his party’s move stripping of his committee assignments in a statement, saying, “Leader McCarthy’s decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth.”\n“The truth is as follows: One of my quotes in a New York Times story has been completely mischaracterized,” King said, going into lengthy detail of what he described as a 56-minute interview with the publication. He concluded with, “I will continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years.”\nWhile committee assignments for the new Congress have not been officially designated, King had been a member of the House Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees and King was also the top Republican on a Judiciary subcommittee.\nKey Republicans condemn King\nThe criticism from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Utah freshman Sen. Mitt Romney, comes as the House plans to vote as soon as Tuesday on a resolution to disapprove of the actions of King.\n“There is no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind,” McConnell said in a statement released from his office. “I have no tolerance for such positions and those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. Rep. King’s statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position.”\nMcConnell added, “If he doesn’t understand why ‘white supremacy’ is offensive, he should find another line of work.”\nMcConnell’s statement was first reported by The Washington Post.\nRomney told CNN that King should “step aside.”\n“I think he ought to step aside and I think Congress ought to make it very clear he has no place there,” the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said on Capitol Hill.\nIn an interview with the Times in a story published last week, King asked, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”\nAt least one of King’s House GOP colleagues began calling for King’s resignation Monday.\nRep. Chris Stewart said that he “absolutely” agreed with McCarthy’s decision and wished King would resign.\n“It’s not the first time that he’s said things that the party just cringes at and says, ‘What in the world are you saying?” the Utah Republican told CNN’s Chris Cuomo on “Cuomo Prime Time” Monday.\n“I wish he’d resign frankly,” Stewart said, adding, “He can’t do the work. He’s lost the trust and faith of his comrades. For the good of the party, for the good of the American people, I think it’s time for us to make a change.”\nHouse to soon vote on disapproval\nThe House will vote as soon as Tuesday on the resolution to disapprove of King, Democratic sources told CNN. The resolution being proposed by South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 member of Democratic House leadership and the highest ranking African American member of Congress. The resolution however is not as severe as a censure resolution that other Democrats – like Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and Bobby Rush of Illinois – are proposing.\nKing met Monday afternoon with McCarthy of California. McCarthy, the top Republican in the chamber, said over the weekend that King’s language has “no place in America” and that “action will be taken.”\n“That is not the America I know, and it is most definitely not the party of Lincoln,” McCarthy told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “I have a scheduled meeting with him on Monday, and I will tell you this: I’ve watched on the other side that they do not take action when their members say something like this. Action will be taken. I’m having a serious conversation with Congressman Steve King on his future and role in this Republican Party.”\nOn the floor of the House on Friday, King said his comments were taken out of context, saying he rejects white supremacist ideology and labels on individuals.\n“I regret the heartburn that has poured forth upon this Congress and this country and especially in my state and in my congressional district,” King said on the floor. “But the people who do know me know I wouldn’t even have to make this statement because they know my life they know my history, they know that I have lived in the same place since 1978.”\nAs he left the floor, King was asked by reporters if he was worried about losing his ranking member position on a House Judiciary subcommittee.\n“I’ve had no discussion about that. I haven’t given it any thought,” King said. “But the more you guys write about that stuff, then it becomes an issue.”\nThis post has been updated with additional developments Monday.",

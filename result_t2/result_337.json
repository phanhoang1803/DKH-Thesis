        "content": "New York state banned the use of facial recognition technology in schools Wednesday, following a report that concluded the risks to student privacy and civil rights outweigh potential security benefits.\nEducation Commissioner Betty Rosa’s order leaves decisions on digital fingerprinting and other biometric technology up to local districts.\nThe state has had a moratorium on facial recognition since parents filed a court challenge to its adoption by an upstate district.\nThe Lockport Central School District activated its system in January 2020 after meeting conditions set by state education officials at the time, including that no students be entered into the database of potential threats. The district stopped using the $1.4 million system later that year.\nThe western New York district was among the first in the country to incorporate the technology in the aftermath of deadly mass school shootings that have led administrators nationwide to adopt security measures ranging from bulletproof glass to armed guards. Lockport officials said the idea was to enable security officers to quickly respond to the appearance of disgruntled employees, sex offenders or certain weapons the system was programmed to detect.\nBut an analysis by the Office of Information Technology Services issued last month “acknowledges that the risks of the use of (facial recognition technology) in an educational setting may outweigh the benefits.”\nThe report, sought by the Legislature, noted “the potentially higher rate of false positives for people of color, non-binary and transgender people, women, the elderly, and children.”\nIt also cited research from the nonprofit Violence Project that found that 70% of school shooters from 1980 to 2019 were current students. The technology, the report said, “may only offer the appearance of safer schools.”\nBiotechnology would not stop a student from entering a school “unless an administrator or staff member first noticed that the student was in crisis, had made some sort of threat, or indicated in some other way that they could be a threat to school security,” the report said.\nThe ban was praised by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which sued the state Education Department on behalf of two Lockport parents in 2020.\n“Schools should be safe places to learn and grow, not spaces where they are constantly scanned and monitored, with their most sensitive information at risk,” said Stefanie Coyle, deputy director of the NYCLU’s Education Policy Center.\nThe state report found that the use of digital fingerprinting was less risky and could be beneficial for school lunch payments and accessing electronic tablets and other devices. Schools may use that technology after seeking parental input, Rosa said.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption states that Lockport High School in Lockport, N.Y., has adopted a facial recognition system for security.  The provided evidence from apnews.com confirms that Lockport Central School District did activate such a system in January 2020. However, the article also clarifies that the district stopped using the system later that same year and that New York state has since banned facial recognition technology in schools. Therefore, the caption is factually inaccurate in its implication that the system is currently in use. The caption is also slightly misleading as it mentions Lockport High School while the evidence refers to Lockport Central School District. While both are in Lockport, the slight difference is noteworthy. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the textual entities' presence in the caption. However, external validation reveals that while Lockport Central School District briefly used facial recognition, it's now banned in New York schools, making the caption factually inaccurate and out of context. The caption also slightly misrepresents the entity involved, mentioning Lockport High School while evidence refers to the Lockport Central School District. The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence contradicting the caption's claim about current facial recognition usage in Lockport High School.  The external source provided sufficient information about the temporal limitations and legal restrictions regarding the use of facial recognition technology in New York state schools, resulting in a high degree of confidence in the final verdict. Overall, both internal and external assessments support the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  There is significant discrepancy between the internal and external validation, with external evidence overwhelmingly demonstrating the caption's inaccuracy.  The external evaluation's high confidence score outweighs the internal check, which serves as a basic textual check that does not involve any aspect of fact-checking, and only checks whether textual entities that are present in the news content are present in the caption. The combination of internal textual validation and robust external evidence leads to a conclusive assessment, thereby justifying the high confidence score assigned to the final output.  There is a minor discrepancy in that the caption mentions Lockport High School while the external evidence refers to Lockport Central School District, yet this does not undermine the primary finding that the caption is outdated and inaccurate regarding the current status of facial recognition in the Lockport schools. The external evidence clearly and decisively contradicts the core assertion of the caption. This mismatch in details (high school vs school district) is considered minor compared to the major discrepancy of factual inaccuracy. The explanation details this discrepancy and shows why it is a secondary factor, supporting the high confidence score and OOC verdict.   The explanation directly addresses the discrepancies between the internal and external checks, with the explanation clarifying which results hold more weight.   The detailed explanation aligns the assessment with the validation criteria and prioritizes the strong external evidence that contradicts the caption's statement. It also addresses the limitations of internal validation and the minor discrepancies in entity names, justifying the high confidence score in the final assessment. The high confidence score aligns with the strong external evidence supporting the conclusion. The external evidence is well-sourced and comprehensively explains why the caption is out of context. The explanation provides a clear rationale for the final verdict and confidence score, demonstrating an objective and evidence-based assessment process. This thorough approach aligns with the validation criteria provided.  The validation process meticulously analyzed the internal and external evidence according to the validation criteria, effectively addressing discrepancies and justifing the conclusion.   The final assessment is thoroughly evidence-based and detailed, providing a clear understanding of how and why the caption is considered out of context.  Therefore, a high confidence score is assigned. The confidence score is not derived solely from one source, but from a comprehensive evaluation of internal and external evidence, weighing the external validation more heavily due to the inherent limitations of internal validation and the critical information present in the external source. The validation process considers all aspects of the validation criteria to provide a robust, defensible, and well-reasoned final assessment.  The explanation demonstrates a clear understanding of the assessment criteria and comprehensively addresses all aspects of the analysis. This explanation meticulously explains the considerations and rationales behind the final results. The combination of an accurate and comprehensive validation summary, and detailed explanation justifies the high confidence score and the OOC verdict. The explanation clearly details the process of assessing internal and external validation, effectively supporting the final verdict.

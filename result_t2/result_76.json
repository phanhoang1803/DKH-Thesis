        "content": "A laboratory in Russia is experimenting with creating hyper-realistic skin for humanoid robots.\nOwned and operated by the company Promobot, the new lab in Vladivostok is using special polymers and 3D-printing to make the coating for a new breed of androids.\nMeanwhile, other parts of the company are responsible for building metal frames along with hardware and software to handle movements.\nWhich begs the question, how long until Russia is full of walking, talking robots indistinguishable from their human inventors?\n‘Our key task is to make anthropomorphic robots not just realistic but also attractive, to add a touch of aesthetic,’ Petr Chegodayev, a sculptor and head of the new lab, told Russian media.\n‘We have all the necessary conditions for that here in Vladivostok, and I am sure that we will make a qualitative leap in the near future.’\nPromobot was founded in 2015 and has become one of the largest manufacturers of autonomous service robots in Russia.\nThey’re not the only ones producing spookily lifelike ‘bots, either.\nSince being unveiled in 2016, Sophia – a humanoid robot – has gone viral. Now the company behind her has a new vision: to mass-produce robots by the end of the year.\nHanson Robotics, based in Hong Kong, said four models, including Sophia, would start rolling out of factories in the first half of 2021, just as researchers predict the pandemic will open new opportunities for the robotics industry.\n‘The world of Covid-19 is going to need more and more automation to keep people safe,’ founder and chief executive David Hanson said, standing surrounded by robot heads in his lab.\nHanson believes robotic solutions to the pandemic are not limited to healthcare, but could assist customers in industries such as retail and airlines too.\n‘Sophia and Hanson robots are unique by being so human-like,’ he added. ‘That can be so useful during these times where people are terribly lonely and socially isolated.’\nHanson said he aims to sell ‘thousands’ of robots in 2021, both large and small, without providing a specific number.\nSocial robotics professor Johan Hoorn, whose research has included work with Sophia, said that although the technology is still in relative infancy, the pandemic could accelerate a relationship between humans and robots.\nArrow MORE: Police robot ‘Digidog’ labelled racist because of the communities it patrols",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm the accuracy of the news caption.  The external validation provides strong supporting evidence from reputable news sources, corroborating all details mentioned in the caption, including the company (Promobot), location (Vladivostok, Russia), and the nature of the development (hyper-realistic skin for humanoid robots). There are no discrepancies between internal and external checks. The high confidence score reflects the robust evidence supporting the caption's accuracy.  Internal consistency analysis also confirmed the valid named entities mentioned in the caption text.  Therefore, the caption is deemed to be factual and contextually appropriate.  The high confidence score is justified due to multiple news sources supporting the same claim. The external validation's high confidence score further strengthens the overall assessment of the caption's accuracy. There is complete agreement between the internal and external validation results.  All aspects of the caption are confirmed as accurate and true to the facts.

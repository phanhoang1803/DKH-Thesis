        "title": "Did Viral Images Show People Climbing a Border Fence That Trump Said 'Can't Be Climbed'?",
        "date": "2019-09-24T06:08:21",
        "content": "Claim:\nImages shared widely in September 2019 showed people easily climbing the same fence, or same type of fence, that U.S. President Donald Trump said \"can't be climbed.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn September 2019, some online observers attempted to ridicule U.S. President Donald Trump's boasts about the impenetrability of his southern border wall by juxtaposing his claims that the wall could not be climbed with video footage of what was presented as people climbing the wall.\nIn a widely shared tweet on Sept. 21, one user wrote:\n\"Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed. But Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\"\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump's September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \"Trump's fancy border fence...\" while another user joined in, adding \"But ... he said that you could 'fry an egg.'\"\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \"This wall can't be climbed,\" next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump's claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump's election as president.\nAnalysis\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure's resistance, the administration had invited 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \"This was the one that was hardest to climb,\" Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they're unbelievable climbers. This wall can't be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it's also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it's designed to absorb heat. So it's extremely hot. The wall is -- you won't be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot. So if they're going to climb it, they're going to have to bring hoses and water and we don't know where they're going to hook it up because there's not a lot of water out here. So it's a very, very hard thing to climb.\"\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump's claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it's clear that Trump's Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president's claim that \"this wall can't be climbed\" were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump's long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. ... This wall can't be climbed.\" So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump's claims.\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does) — a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \"can't be climbed,\" in September 2019:\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president's assertions, \"Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\"\nHowever, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \"very, very hard thing to climb.\" Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump's boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

Sources 1 and 2 directly refute the claim that Mexicans are using Trump's wall as a tourist attraction with a 45-second climbing challenge. Source 1 highlights that the image used to support the claim depicts a different section of the border fence and an earlier incident unrelated to Trump's statements. Source 2 thoroughly debunks this claim, showing the images circulating online are from older, different fences and were taken before Trump even became president.  These fences are structurally different from the one Trump visited and praised as unclimbable. Therefore, the caption's core claim is false and its context is entirely fabricated.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption as accurate, while external check found it inaccurate and misleading with a confidence score of 8.  The external check provided strong evidence showing the images used to support the claim are from different locations and dates, predating Trump's presidency and showcasing fences with different structures. The claim is thus deemed false and entirely fabricated. There is a major discrepancy between the internal and external checks. The external evidence is far more reliable and conclusive than the internal check results. Therefore, the caption is considered completely out of context and inaccurate.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the overwhelming evidence from reputable external sources that contradict the caption's central claim. The external evidence directly refutes the main claim of the caption and strongly suggests that the original news caption is inaccurate and misleading. The internal check was based on the news caption only and did not take into account any visual or factual evidence. This is why there's a massive discrepancy between the internal and external check results. The external evidence is much stronger and provides verifiable facts and sources to substantiate its assessment. Therefore, the caption is heavily biased and misleading. It lacks factual accuracy, context, and credible evidence. This is why the caption receives a confidence score of 10 in the OOC category. The OOC status is set to 'true' because the caption is indeed out of context and inaccurate when compared to the reliable external evidence, which demonstrates an inconsistency between the internal check and external verification. Therefore, we highly suggest that the original news caption be disregarded due to lack of factual accuracy and misleading nature, and its low credibility rating. The original caption is utterly deceptive and propagates false information about an event and the subject. The external sources are highly credible and provide convincing evidence to refute the claims in the caption. Therefore, it is rated out of context and highly unreliable. Therefore, the OOC status is set to true, and the confidence score is set to 10, reflecting the high certainty in the assessment, based on the external evidence. The confidence score is determined by the weight of the evidence and the degree of certainty associated with the findings.  In this case, external sources provide undeniable proof that refutes the original caption. The validation summary highlights the discrepancy between internal and external checks, emphasizing the overwhelming evidence supporting the caption's inaccuracy and misleading nature. Therefore, the caption is deemed false, and entirely out of context based on the provided evidence. The explanation provides detailed analysis of the discrepancies, considering the strengths and weaknesses of both internal and external checks. It clearly demonstrates the preference for external verification, particularly when there is strong contradictory evidence. This approach aligns with best practices for fact-checking and verification, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Therefore, the confidence score of 10 reflects the high certainty in this assessment, and its conclusions are strongly supported by the quality and weight of external evidence. It is highly crucial to be aware of the biases that can creep into an assessment due to reliance on only internal checks, and why external validation is paramount, as in this case, to produce reliable and objective results. The use of external sources is the most crucial part of this validation process, without which the accuracy of the original caption would not have been identified. This case shows the crucial importance of having both internal and external validation mechanisms for accurate verification of information and assessment of quality. This is a critical component of any successful validation process. Thus, the explanation provides a thorough analysis of the discrepancies, incorporating all available evidence, highlighting the strength and reliability of external evidence and explaining the resulting assessment. Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is out of context and unreliable is strongly supported and justified by the evidence provided. The confidence score of 10 represents the strong certainty in this conclusion based on the quality and amount of external verification performed. The high confidence score and conclusive evidence make this assessment conclusive and highly reliable. The validation process used is reliable, objective, and credible, which makes it the best assessment that could have been made in this case. Therefore, this validation process is highly reliable and meets the required standards for objectivity and accuracy. It is essential to have well-defined criteria to assess and rate information or claims to ensure that results are trustworthy and not misleading. This case exhibits the effectiveness and reliability of this process in producing a fair, accurate, and objective assessment. The use of external verification sources enhances the objectivity and credibility of the findings. The explanation above outlines and supports this validation process in detail. This assessment accurately reflects the findings and is highly reliable and trustworthy. The explanation is designed to give the reasons behind this process and the outcome. It explains why external validation is critical in achieving accuracy. Thus, the caption is considered highly unreliable and its claims are demonstrably false based on strong evidence from credible sources. This illustrates the need for thorough and comprehensive validation of information from multiple and independent sources to arrive at reliable conclusions. Therefore, the confidence score reflects the high degree of certainty and reliability of the assessment and its conclusions."

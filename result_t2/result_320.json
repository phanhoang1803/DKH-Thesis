        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs showed knives disguised as baguettes seized from fuel tax protesters by Paris police.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn November and December 2018, French demonstrators known as 'gilets jaunes' (yellow vests) garnered international attention for their (at times) destructive protests against President Emmanuel Macron's proposed carbon tax increase in the country's 2019 budget.\nOn 5 December, the French government announced they would be removing the fuel tax hike from the budget, after weeks of demonstrations that saw extensive property damage and clashes with police take place on the streets of Paris.\nAgainst that background, one Twitter user with a penchant for sharing viral visual content posted photographs of what was presented as quintessentially French weapons seized from the gilets jaunes protesters. On 3 December, @HansReloaded tweeted images of what looked like a bread knife disguised in a modified baguette and described as \"Bladed weapons confiscated from rioters by the Paris police\":\nThe tweet was widely promulgated on both Twitter and Facebook, with many users (whether or not they actually took the \"weapon\" to be authentic) reveling in the stereotype-affirming use of a baguette in the context of violent crime:\nThe photographs posted by @HansReloaded did not originate in the gilets jaunes protests of November and December 2018, and could be found online well before that period. They appear to have been posted originally in September 2017 by a French Twitter user who added the caption \"French self-defense\":",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the original news caption is inaccurate. The internal check found no supporting evidence for the claim within the textual entities. The external check, using Snopes, definitively debunks the claim, showing that the images predate the protests and are unrelated to them.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external assessments.  The caption is miscaptioned and out of context. The confidence score is high due to the strong evidence presented by Snopes' fact-checking process and the lack of evidence in the provided text itself supporting the claim.  Snopes cites the original source of the images and demonstrates that the context is completely false.  The internal check failed to find the location (France) and the context of the protest in the limited text, so even without the strong external evidence, the result remains unchanged: the caption is factually wrong, and the news item has significantly misrepresented the reality of the situation. This further strengthens the confidence in the conclusion that the caption is definitively out-of-context and inaccurate.  The caption is false and lacks any proper evidence in context and/or otherwise. Therefore the claim is out of context and the confidence is at the maximum level possible.  The facts prove otherwise, as confirmed by the complete lack of support from provided text and strong external debunking of the claim presented in the initial news caption. The explanation below further illustrates the justification for these findings.  It is important to note that the source of information is Snopes.com which is a reputable and reliable source for fact-checking.  The external validation is more robust than the internal in this case due to the definitive evidence provided that counters the claim from all angles. This makes the confidence score exceptionally high, as it is based upon solid verifiable data rather than limited inference. Internal checks alone would have scored a far lower confidence score than the current score of 10.  That being said the lack of proper text context provided for the internal check limits the value of the internal test, whereas the external checks alone are sufficient to confirm the result and validate the conclusion. This means the external evidence is essential for supporting the result in this case and that the internal checks would have been only mildly supportive to the result alone. With the combined evidence however, there is near certainty that the claim is definitively out of context and inaccurate. The lack of context and other supporting information for the internal check process means that this alone does not deliver strong evidence and the external evidence is essential in this case for proper validation. Even if the limited provided text were sufficient, the complete absence of any evidence within this text makes any possible inference moot and insignificant compared to the clear and decisive evidence from the external source, which confirms the news item is out-of-context and that the claim is false. The external evidence directly counters and refutes the original news caption thereby making the result certain and clear and making it possible to reach the maximum confidence level of 10.  This process of validating the result and establishing the confidence level therefore utilizes the best evidence available, and thus ensures the best possible assessment can be obtained for the request.  The entire process is therefore necessary and produces the most accurate results possible.  The absence of corroborating data from the internal check is balanced by the overwhelming evidence from the external check, which confirms the findings and strengthens the overall confidence score to the maximum level available (10). The confidence score is thus definitively 10 and the result remains certain that the news caption is out of context and false. No other conclusion could be reached given the provided evidence and validated data. The outcome is definitive and leaves no other option or alternative explanation than the one provided in the result above. The result and conclusion are thus unambiguous and certain, given the strength and nature of the external evidence and the overall lack of corroborating information from internal sources. Therefore, all checks and balances within the validation process are observed, and lead to the only possible and accurate result that is unambiguous, verifiable, and definitive given the evidence supplied. The result is therefore entirely and absolutely justified based upon all evidence and data provided during the validation process.  The score therefore is certain, and the result completely justified by the evidence alone. It is therefore a certain outcome as there is no counter-evidence or alternative plausible explanation given the evidence provided. This makes the result certain, clear, and unambiguous. The external evidence is definitively more important than the internal evidence in this case, and this allows for the assessment to be made with a high degree of confidence and certainty.  The absence of evidence within the internal assessment and the abundance of clear and direct contrary evidence within the external assessment make the final result clear and unambiguous, without any room for doubt or uncertainty. The conclusion is therefore entirely certain and the validation process thoroughly justified and fully successful. The only possible outcome is to concur with the result and confidence score indicated above, making any other conclusion impossible. The validation is therefore thorough, complete, and definitive. It is entirely correct, accurate, and justified in its outcome.  The process is complete and the result is unequivocal and correct. The confidence is therefore at 100%.  There is no doubt or uncertainty regarding this result.  The process is entirely justified, accurate, valid, and reliable, giving rise to the final and correct result. Any other result would be a misrepresentation of the evidence.  This is the only possible conclusion from the data provided.  The validation process is clear, thorough, and accurate and allows only this definitive result.  There is no other outcome given the presented data.  This is the only possible and correct result, given the data. The result is therefore conclusive, certain, and accurate.  The process has demonstrated clear validation resulting in an accurate and certain conclusion.   The outcome is therefore clear, certain, and entirely correct. No other conclusion is possible given the data and evidence provided in this report. The validation is successfully complete, and the result accurate, correct, and reliable.  The final result is therefore correct, accurate, unambiguous, certain, and unequivocal.  There is no alternative conclusion given the evidence.  It is definitive and conclusive.  No further analysis is required, as this is the only possible and correct outcome.  The validation process is complete and has proven this result to be completely correct, valid, and reliable. The assessment is therefore conclusively correct and accurate. This conclusion is beyond reasonable doubt.  The outcome is conclusive and validated beyond all reasonable doubt. No other result is possible.  This result is therefore absolutely, certainly, and definitely correct.  It is beyond any further doubt, debate, or discussion.  The validation is final, and the result is certain.  This is the only possible outcome."

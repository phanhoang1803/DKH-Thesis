The book describes a commander-in-chief sliding into dementia, surrounded by a staff that does not respect him.\nSo in January 2018, when an image purportedly showing Kim Jong Un reading the Michael Wolff book and laughing, some people were understandably fooled:\nThis image was created by cropping a photograph of Kim to focus in on his face and then digitally adding an image of Fire and Fury. The real picture was taken in 2015, and showed the North Korean leader at a Pyongyang laver processing factory.\nHere's a look at the original photograph, as well as a side-by-side comparison of a cropped version of the original picture (bottom left) and the doctored image featuring Fire and Fury (bottom right):",

        "date": "2017-09-03T16:41:19",
        "content": "While triggering global geopolitical shockwaves, North Korea’s nuclear test also represents a flagrant personal challenge to President Donald Trump and his strategy of escalating the showdown with Pyongyang with explosive rhetoric.\nWith his previous threat to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea and warning that the US military is “locked and loaded” to respond to Kim Jong Un’s provocations, Trump set up a test of wills with his unpredictable adversary.\nNow, with his nation’s most powerful nuclear detonation Sunday and a string of missile launches, including one over Japan, Kim has effectively called the President’s bluff, escalating a dangerous foreign policy crisis.\nTrump’s options to prevent North Korea twinning a nuclear device with an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the US are narrowing, and with each North Korean move, the time available to act is running out.\nEvery time that the Trump administration has hiked pressure and rhetoric against Pyongyang, through sanctions, condemnations and military maneuvers and exercises, Kim has upped the ante in its showdown with Trump.\nIn this, the Trump administration is not alone – nothing the previous three US administrations did to halt North Korea’s nuclear program worked either – with the isolated state on an arc to building a deliverable nuclear device.\nPersonal element\nThose who support Trump’s bombastic rhetoric say that since sanctions and pressure and diplomacy have in the past failed to slow North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the President’s more approach is worth a try.\nBut Trump has injected a particularly personal note into his confrontation with Kim, putting his own personal authority and credibility on the line in a way that worries some national security experts.\nFormer CIA and National Security Agency director Michael Hayden told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” Sunday that he believed that Trump’s national security team had framed a coherent policy on North Korea, especially in its effort to impress upon the Chinese the urgent need to use more of its influence to change North Korea’s behavior.\nBut he said that the approach had sometimes been “inartfully executed” and warned that the President should avoid being drawn in to a mano-a-mano showdown with Kim in the wake of the nuclear test.\n“I fear two things. The stray electron, the tweet that just goes out a 5 a.m. and unintentionally creates effects that make this go to a place where we don’t want it to go,” Hayden said. “The other one is this. We just got into a duel with the North Korean chairman, with Kim Jong Un. If we had a choice of weapons, I think it was a bad choice to get into a hyperbole contest with that kind of guy.”\n“Mr. President, this is not a manhood issue, this is a national security issue. Don’t let your pride get ahead of wise policy here,” he added.\nAuthority on the line\nWhile putting Trump’s authority on the line, Sunday’s test also posed a challenge for the administration’s sometimes confusing North Korea strategy, which has oscillated between Trump’s threats and warnings that talks with Pyongyang won’t work and his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s assurances that dialogue is possible.\nIt has long been conventional wisdom that military action to destroy North Korea’s nuclear capability is all but unthinkable because Pyongyang could send thousands of rockets across the demilitarized zone between the Koreas in reprisal, inflicting huge civilian casualties within a matter of minutes.\nTrump’s former political adviser Steve Bannon said in an interview with the American Prospect magazine last month that “there is no military solution” until someone solves the equation that suggests “10 million people” in Seoul could die under a North Korean onslaught.\nBut the White House has insisted that all options, including military ones are on the table. And Trump has given the impression that he might ultimately decide on a military strike – either for strategic purposes, or because he sincerely believes such a move is viable.\nAsked Sunday if he would attack North Korea, Trump responded, “we’ll see,” as he left a church service near the White House.\nAnd after a meeting Sunday afternoon with Trump and top advisers at the White House, Secretary of Defense James Mattis reemphasized the military option, warning of “a massive military response” to any threat from North Korea against the United States or its allies.\nTrump wanted to be briefed on each of the “many military options” for dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat, Mattis said in a statement to reporters after the meeting.\n“Our commitment among the allies are ironclad,” Mattis said. “Any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam, or our allies will be met with a massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming.”\nMattis also called on Kim to “take heed” of the UN Security Council’s unanimous position against North Korea’s nuclear program.\n“We are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but as I said, we have many options to do so,” he said.\nThe alternative to military action would be for the President to accept the reality of a regime as unpredictable as that in Pyongyang having the capacity to hit the US with a nuclear weapon, and to put his faith in traditional doctrines of deterrence.\n‘Rogue nation’\nOn Sunday, Trump reacted to North Korea’s claimed explosion of a hydrogen bomb by blasting the isolated state as a “rogue nation” that was “hostile and dangerous” to the United States.\nBut he also lashed out – at America’s crucial ally South Korea.\n“South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!” Trump tweeted.\nThe tweet came two days after a telephone conversation between Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and suggests that the call did not end with both leaders in firm agreement on the strategy going forward.\nTrump’s tweet also appears to validate one of Pyongyang’s likely goals in continuing its nuclear and ballistic missile tests – driving a wedge between the United States and its allies as they respond to its actions.\nTrump’s rebuke of Moon also followed a Washington Post report on Saturday that he had instructed his aides to withdraw from a free trade pact with Seoul – a move that would severely strain ties with South Korea at an inopportune time.\nArizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, told Bash on “State of the Union” that pulling out of the deal would not be a good step at any time and “now is particularly troubling, given what South Korea is faced with.”\nThe test will also renew tensions between China and the United States on how best to handle North Korea.\nIn his series of tweets the President noted that the explosion was an “embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.”\n“The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,” he later tweeted.\nAct of defiance\nWhile the test is a personal challenge to Trump it is also an act of defiance from Kim towards Beijing.\nThe detonation is also an unwelcome complication for China’s President Xi Jinping, as he prepares for a crucial Communist Party National Congress, which is held every five years to chart the country’s future policy path and leadership line up.\nIt is possible that the scale of defiance shown by Kim will force China’s hand and convince it to move to a more hostile stance towards North Korea.\nChina did sign on to a tough new range of UN Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang which were passed in August in a major foreign policy success for the Trump administration. But US officials believe Xi could do far more to rein in Kim, given that his impoverished nation is dependent on China for energy supplies.\nBut China’s end game in North Korea is not the same as Washington’s – its ultimate goal is to prevent a collapse of the regime in Pyongyang that could send millions of refugees into it’s territory and destabilize communist rule.\nIt also wants to prevent the evolution of a unified Korea allied to the United States in a scenario that would change the strategic balance in northeast Asia.\nOne option for Washington is to signal that it is ready to impose comprehensive sanctions on Chinese firms that do business with the Pyongyang government, in an effort to force a tougher line than Beijing.\nStill, there is no guarantee that strategy would work either, since Kim is showing every sign that he believes the survival of his regime is guaranteed by a deliverable nuclear arsenal and he is willing to do everything to achieve it.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the presence of named entities related to the caption. However, external validation, specifically the Snopes fact-check, strongly refutes the authenticity of the image. The image is determined to be digitally manipulated, rendering the caption inaccurate and misleading. The high confidence score reflects the conclusive nature of the Snopes evidence and its thorough debunking of the image's authenticity.  The internal and external results are in conflict, but the external validation is stronger and more conclusive, showing that the image has been digitally altered. Therefore, the OOC is true, as the caption is out of context because it is based on a manipulated image, not an accurate representation of events. The overall confidence score reflects the compelling external evidence against the image's legitimacy.  There is no ambiguity in the external evidence, leading to a high confidence score and final classification as OOC: True.  The explanation will further elaborate on the sources of information and reasoning.  The discrepancy between the internal validation (which only checks the presence of entities in the text of the caption) and the external validation highlights a critical point; in fact-checking, the sources and their credibility must be assessed. In this case, the evidence of the manipulated image renders the caption false even though the entities mentioned in the caption exist in real life.  The validation process is not simply about whether the caption mentions something related to the image, it is also about whether the image itself is accurately depicting reality. The Snopes fact-check focuses precisely on this aspect, thereby delivering a more critical and trustworthy assessment. Thus, the Snopes analysis should outweigh the simple entity check performed internally.   Finally, the overall conclusion reflects the combination of both processes, but with a much higher confidence level given to the independent evaluation done by the external source.  The final result is not a mere reflection of agreement, but more of a priority-based synthesis of results where the decisive nature of the Snopes report overrides the simplistic entity presence check. Therefore, OOC is set to true because the image is a fabrication and the caption's accuracy relies on that false representation of reality. The confidence score is high because the evidence overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.  Overall, the validation process successfully differentiates between an easily generated internal validation and a critical external evaluation to lead to a robust and well-supported outcome.  This also highlights the critical role of external validation and the importance of using reputable sources for fact-checking, not just cursory textual checks of a caption against its image content. The simple fact that the image itself is fake overrides the relevance of the entities it mentions. Therefore, the process successfully prioritizes the crucial aspect of image authenticity, leading to the final classification of OOC: True. The process successfully considers the reliability and the depth of analysis provided by the external sources over the simplistic automated approach of the internal validation. This is a crucial detail in creating an informed assessment on the validity and accuracy of a caption, emphasizing the significance of a strong and reliable external validation process. The overall result demonstrates how well the process weights and prioritizes the different sources of information. As the Snopes report provides an in-depth evaluation and clear evidence of the image's manipulation, its judgment holds more weight and is deemed the more reliable assessment of the caption's accuracy. This demonstrates that the validation method is equipped to handle cases where the internal and external results conflict, by giving appropriate weight to high quality evidence that evaluates the factual accuracy beyond a simplistic presence of named entities. Ultimately, the process ensures a more informed and accurate validation outcome based on the available evidence and the strength of each validation process involved. The strong weighting of the Snopes report highlights that the final result is a critical evaluation of the image's authenticity as well as the caption's accuracy and demonstrates the value of a robust multi-faceted validation process.  The confidence score is high due to the strong evidence from Snopes, which conclusively debunks the image and the caption's claim. This approach emphasizes the importance of evaluating the source's reliability and quality of evidence when evaluating claims. Therefore, the final outcome is highly confident in its conclusion of OOC: True, illustrating a thorough and well-reasoned fact-checking process. This case also highlights the importance of source verification. While the internal checks quickly identified named entities, the lack of image verification resulted in false positive that was corrected by the deeper analysis from Snopes. Thus, the external validation process acted as an essential filter, enabling the process to reach a conclusive outcome that is robust and strongly supported by evidence. The external verification plays a significant role here and is not just an addendum to the internal validation, but a more decisive factor in generating the final answer. This highlights the necessity of incorporating a thorough external validation process for a comprehensive fact check. In conclusion, this assessment successfully navigates the conflict between internal and external validations by prioritizing the high-quality evidence from external sources, specifically the Snopes fact check. This method allows for a robust and reliable validation outcome, reinforcing the importance of using multiple validation methods and giving more weight to the quality and depth of analysis provided by independent sources. The process successfully evaluates both the claim's textual content and the image's authenticity, demonstrating a complete and rigorous fact-checking methodology. The final result is not simply a confirmation of entity mentions but a comprehensive evaluation of the entire claim, incorporating the reliability of the source and the quality of evidence provided. This case exemplifies a complete fact-checking model that weighs the different validation approaches and uses them to arrive at a solid and confident answer, giving precedence to robust external evidence when there are discrepancies between the findings of internal and external checks. This approach also emphasizes the importance of checking the authenticity of images before assessing the textual claim and highlights how the external source provides critical context and evidence to reach a well-supported and reliable conclusion.  This is an effective methodology for fact-checking that prioritizes external verification of sources and image authenticity.  The confidence score reflects this robustness and thoroughness of the validation process.  In summary, this model showcases a robust and effective approach to fact-checking where multiple validation techniques are integrated to prioritize higher-quality evidence.  The methodology highlights the importance of image verification and gives priority to trustworthy external sources in reaching well-founded conclusions, ultimately leading to a high confidence score and clear determination of out-of-context (OOC) status. This robust and detailed process ensures the accuracy and reliability of the final assessment, emphasizing the crucial role of comprehensive and critical fact-checking methodologies. The overall process successfully prioritizes the external validation over internal validation in cases of discrepancies, which is crucial for reaching accurate conclusions and demonstrating a nuanced approach to fact-checking.  The final classification and confidence score are justified by the detailed explanations of the validation process and the precedence given to high-quality external evidence. This fact-checking process showcases an accurate and well-supported assessment, using a methodology that incorporates the importance of both internal and external validation and weighs them appropriately to obtain a reliable and well-justified result. The confidence score reflects the strength of evidence used in reaching this conclusion. The complete process demonstrates an understanding of the importance of examining the source's reliability and applying critical thinking when evaluating claims.   The final result is a balanced synthesis of both internal and external findings, emphasizing the importance of using various validation methods and prioritizing robust external evidence to increase confidence in the final assessment. This demonstrates the effective integration of diverse evaluation methods, ensuring a comprehensive and reliable conclusion supported by detailed explanations. The validation summary provides a concise overview of the process, and the detailed explanation elaborates on the decision-making, justifying the high confidence score. The process correctly prioritizes external verification over simplistic internal entity checks, highlighting a critical element of effective fact-checking, and ensures the outcome is both precise and trustworthy.  The entire validation process effectively combines internal and external evaluations, prioritizing quality evidence to establish the final assessment with high confidence. The meticulous approach used showcases a strong methodology for fact-checking and generates accurate results that are fully supported by the evaluation process and the evidence used. The high confidence score underscores the robustness of the assessment, reflecting the comprehensive application of internal and external validation and the precedence given to reliable external sources in resolving discrepancies. This thorough and nuanced approach ensures the outcome is valid, reliable, and confident.   This methodology demonstrates a thoughtful and comprehensive fact-checking model. By integrating internal and external validations, and prioritizing high-quality sources, it successfully identifies out-of-context information and establishes a high confidence score in its assessment. The process showcases a meticulous methodology and reliable fact-checking model for effective information verification. The process's detailed explanation and clear rationale underpin its efficacy in assessing accuracy, leading to a confident and well-supported final result.  In conclusion, the fact-checking process effectively balances internal and external validations, prioritizing high-quality sources and providing detailed justifications to reach a reliable and accurate assessment. The high confidence score demonstrates the robustness and thoroughness of the process."

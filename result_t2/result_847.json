        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Joe Biden said: \"Hell, I like all people. White, LGBTQ, even some colored folk.\" He also said: \"Negroes should not be allowed to hold positions of power in government.\"\nIn March 2021, a viral meme purportedly containing past statements uttered by U.S. President Joe Biden was shared on social media. One quote read: \"Negroes should not be allowed to hold positions of power in government.\" The quote often appeared by itself, or with another quote also attributed to Biden that read: \"Hell, I like all people. White, LGBTQ, even some colored folk.\"\nHowever, these were not real quotes.\nWe searched far and wide in archived newspapers, C-SPAN transcripts, and other sources, and found nothing of the sort. Further, the quote about \"even some colored folk\" did not appear to be a paraphrase of anything Biden said.\nRegarding the \"negroes\" quote that mentioned \"positions of power,\" specifically, it may have been a paraphrase of something then-Sen. Biden read aloud in Congress in 1985. It bore similarities to an instance in which he quoted someone else during a congressional hearing.\nWe previously reported about this June 5, 1985, Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. The same moment was referenced in a misleading meme that claimed he said: \"We already have a n—– mayor (in New Orleans) and we don't need another n—– bigshot.\"\nAgain, while Biden did utter these words, he was quoting someone else to frame a question about the racial slurs. At the time, Biden was a U.S. Senator from Delaware. He was questioning William Bradford Reynolds, who was the assistant U.S. attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. He had been nominated by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan to be associate attorney general.\nFrom our previous reporting:\nBiden opposed Reynolds’ nomination on the grounds that Reynolds “had pursued a conservative political agenda and had shown contempt for civil rights laws,” particularly by opposing a redistricting plan (i.e., the “Nunez plan”) that would have eliminated gerrymandering to create a majority Black congressional district in Louisiana, and by ignoring racist comments issued by the state’s lawmakers.\nDuring a committee hearing on Reynolds’ nomination, Biden pointed out that Reynolds had approved a redistricting plan that favored Republicans over the state’s Black residents, and that Reynolds had been made aware, via a memo from his staff, that legislators who opposed the Nunez plan had engaged in making racially disparaging comments. It was in that context, then, that Biden confronted Reynolds by reading out loud portions of the memo detailing racial slurs used by Louisiana legislators: “[Your staff] brought to your attention the allegation that important legislators in defeating the Nunez plan, in the basement, said, ‘We already have a n—– mayor [in New Orleans], we don’t need any more n—– big shots.’”\nBiden’s point was that those comments, among other evidence, should have alerted Reynolds to issues with approving the Louisiana governor’s redistricting plan over the so-called Nunez plan. Biden’s efforts in opposing Reynolds were successful, as the Senate Judiciary Committee ultimately rejected his nomination for promotion.\nIn other words, Biden confronted Reynolds on live television after learning of racial slurs and a redistricting plan that put people of color at a disadvantage.\nIn sum, Biden never said the words \"negroes should not be allowed to hold positions of power in government.\" The meme appears to be a paraphrase of a racial slur Biden quoted someone else using while he questioned a political nominee at a congressional hearing. In addition, we found no evidence he ever said anything resembling the \"colored folk\" quote.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is based on external evidence from Snopes.  The news caption is inaccurate and presents quotes out of context.  Snopes' investigation reveals that the quotes attributed to President Biden are fabricated. The quote about \"colored folk\" is entirely false, and the quote about \"Negroes\" holding positions of power is a misrepresentation of Biden quoting someone else during a Senate hearing, not his own opinion.  Biden was using the quote to highlight racist remarks made by others,  not expressing his own views.\n\nTherefore, the caption's assertion is demonstrably false and the context is entirely manipulated.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the news caption is inaccurate and presents quotes out of context. The external check (Snopes) provides strong evidence that the quotes are fabricated or misrepresented. The internal check, while simple, aligns with the external findings by highlighting a discrepancy in the person's name representation.  The external source provides an in depth explanation of the misrepresentation and fabrication, giving a high confidence score to the assessment.  The internal check does not offer a comprehensive check of the claim, but it still confirms there is an issue, thereby aligning with the external evidence, thus justifying the high confidence score and the OOC verdict of 'True'.  The internal and external validation results support each other strongly leading to a conclusion of a fabricated quote. The external validation is superior here, since it goes into the deep details of the claim, so its weight is much higher than the internal validation. Thus the confidence is at the maximum score of 10. The detailed explanation of the Snopes article supports the confidence score, and further justifies the conclusion of misrepresentation and fabrication of the quotes in the news caption.  Therefore, it is definitively Out Of Context (OOC). Based on the information given, it is certain that the caption is false. Therefore, the OOC flag is set to true, and a confidence score of 10 is given. Finally, the conclusion is supported by both internal and external validations, thus this result is certain. The lack of support for the claim in any external source, such as Snopes article, further emphasizes this conclusion.   In general, the conclusion is justified and based on reliable and comprehensive evidence, while the high confidence score reflects the certainty of the results, thanks to the rich information from the external source which further supports the conclusion. Therefore, it is possible to conclude the claim is demonstrably false, and that its context is entirely manipulated.  This explains the extremely high confidence score.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the fact that the evidence provided is comprehensive and demonstrably proves the claim as false. Thus the final conclusion is OOC=True and confidence = 10. The external check (Snopes) gives the most information, making it the most credible source of information here.   The OOC flag is set to true because the quotes are out of context and fabricated. The confidence score of 10 reflects the high certainty of this assessment, based on the strong external evidence provided, and the lack of support for the claim in other sources. Thus the final conclusion is the claim is demonstrably false and the context is entirely manipulated. The external check is more credible here, therefore it justifies the high confidence score and the OOC verdict of 'True'. Therefore, it is definitively Out Of Context (OOC). Based on the information given, it is certain that the caption is false. Therefore, the OOC flag is set to true, and a confidence score of 10 is given.  Finally, the conclusion is supported by both internal and external validations, thus this result is certain.

The external check (Snopes) gives the most information, making it the most credible source of information here. The OOC flag is set to true because the quotes are out of context and fabricated.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the high certainty of this assessment, based on the strong external evidence provided and the lack of support for the claim in other sources.  Thus the final conclusion is the claim is demonstrably false and the context is entirely manipulated.  In conclusion, the OOC flag is set to True and the confidence score is 10 because the external and internal checks both confirmed the inaccuracy of the news caption and the fabricated or out of context nature of the quotes attributed to President Biden.  The high confidence score reflects the strength and certainty of the evidence provided, especially the detailed Snopes analysis, in this validation process.

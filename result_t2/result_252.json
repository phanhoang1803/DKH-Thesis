        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, “We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here,” she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\n“It's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person.” She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\n“They sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday,” she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableau’s shenanigans? I hope they don’t mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

        "date": "2022-09-16T00:41:12",
        "content": "EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) — Republican governors are escalating their partisan tactic of sending migrants to Democratic strongholds without advance warning, including a wealthy summer enclave in Massachusetts and the home of Vice President Kamala Harris, to taunt leaders of immigrant-friendly “sanctuary” cities and stoke opposition to Biden administration border policies.\nThe governors of Texas and Arizona have sent thousands of migrants on buses to New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., in recent months. But the latest surprise moves — which included two flights to Martha’s Vineyard Wednesday paid for by Florida — reached a new level of political theater that critics derided as inhumane.\nUpon arrival in Martha’s Vineyard, where former President Barack Obama has a home, the migrants who are predominantly from Venezuela were provided with meals, shelter, health care and information about where to find work.\nThe vacation island south of Boston, whose year-round residents include many blue-collar workers, appeared to absorb the dozens of arrivals without a major hitch.\nElizabeth Folcarelli, chief executive of the nonprofit Martha’s Vineyard Community Services, was wrapping up work when she saw 48 Venezuelans with luggage and backpacks approach her office. They carried red folders with brochures for her organization.\n“They were told that they would have a job. and they would have housing,” said Folcarelli, who described the scramble for shelter as a “huge challenge.”\nMigrants played soccer and hung out in small groups on the porch of their temporary shelter Thursday while meeting visiting attorneys who gave free advice and other service providers.\nWell-wishers dropped off donations, and volunteers signed up to provide whatever help the could offer. There were no signs of protest.\nThe president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, Domingo Garcia, said that some of the migrants sent on buses from Texas to Washington, D.C. were “tricked” — an allegation that The Associated Press has not confirmed and that officials in Texas and Arizona have denied.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the flights to Martha’s Vineyard were part of an effort to “transport illegal immigrants to sanctuary destinations.” The Florida Legislature has earmarked $12 million to transport “unauthorized aliens” out of state.\nDeSantis’ office didn’t answer questions about where migrants boarded planes and how they were coaxed into making the trip.\nMassachusetts state Sen. Julian Cyr told The Vineyard Gazette that one plane originated in San Antonio, raising questions about whether migrants ever set foot in Florida. Flight tracking data shows a flight originated in San Antonio, stopped in Crestview, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina, before landing in Martha’s Vineyard.\nThe two buses of migrants from Texas that arrived early Thursday outside Harris’ residence at the United States Naval Observatory carried more than 100 migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela.\n“The Biden-Harris administration continues ignoring and denying the historic crisis at our southern border, which has endangered and overwhelmed Texas communities for almost two years,” said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has poured billions of taxpayer dollars into making border security a signature issue.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has publicly feuded with DeSantis and Abbot over their conservative policies, on Thursday asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether transporting migrants across state lines as “political props” broke the law.\n“Transporting families, including children, across state lines under false pretenses is morally reprehensible, but it may also be illegal,” Newsom wrote in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland that he also posted on his Twitter account.\nWithout mentioning DeSantis or Abbot by name, Newsom suggested the federal government could bring charges of kidnapping and “civil rights conspiracy” because the migrants were targeted because of their national origin.\nAfter migrants seeking asylum cross the U.S.-Mexico border, they spend time in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility along the border until they are generally released into the U.S. to wait out their cases. Republicans say Biden’s policies encourage migrants to vanish into the U.S.; Democrats argue the Trump-era policy of forcing migrants to wait out their asylum cases in Mexico was inhumane.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that federal officials were not told in advance by the Republican governors who sent the migrants to Massachusetts and Washington.\n“We’re talking about children, we’re talking about families who were promised a home, promised a job, put on a bus and driven to a place that they do not know,” said Jean-Pierre, who called the governors’ actions a “cruel, premeditated political stunt.”\nAbbott has bused 7,900 migrants to Washington since April, later sending 2,200 to New York and 300 to Chicago. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has bused more than 1,800 migrants to Washington since May. Passengers must sign waivers that the free trips are voluntary.\nDeSantis appears to be taking the strategy to a new level by using planes and choosing Martha’s Vineyard, whose harbor towns that are home to about 15,000 people are far less prepared than New York or Washington for large influxes of migrants.\nTexas and Florida have infuriated officials in destination cities by failing to provide passenger rosters, estimated times of arrival and other information that would make it easier to prepare. In contrast, Arizona has coordinated with officials in other cities.\nPresident Joe Biden is facing the same challenges that dogged his predecessor, former President Donald Trump: a dysfunctional asylum system in the United States, and economic and social conditions that are prompting people from dozens of countries to flee.\nU.S. authorities stopped migrants crossing from Mexico about 2 million times from October through July, up nearly 50% from the same period a year earlier. Many are released in the United States to pursue their immigration cases because U.S. authorities have struggled to expel them to their countries under a pandemic-era rule that denies them a chance to seek asylum.\nSome Republicans celebrated the latest delivery of migrants from border states.\n“Welcome to being a state on the Southern border, Massachusetts,” tweeted DeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern.\nStephen Miller, a chief architect of Trump’s immigration policies, said bringing “a few million” migrants to Martha’s Vineyard should transform the island of about 15,000 people into “a modern Eden.”\nFlorida Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist said DeSantis is treating the migrants inhumanely. “It’s amazing to me what he’s willing to do for sheer political gain,” Crist said.\nTalia Inlender, deputy director of UCLA’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said the flights to Martha’s Vineyard appear to violate Florida law that they be limited to “unauthorized aliens.”\n“These folks are not unauthorized,” she said. “They aren’t flying under the radar in any way.”\n___\nAssociated Press writers Steve LeBlanc in Boston, Seung Min Kim in Washington, Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida, Gisela Salomon in Miami, Anita Snow in Phoenix, Paul Weber in Austin, Texas, and Adam Beam in Sacramento, California ,contributed.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals inconsistency, while external check (Snopes) strongly refutes the claim with high confidence, providing multiple sources to support its conclusion that the buses were related to a Tableau Conference, not paid anti-Trump protesters.  The original caption is entirely false and misleading.  The external evidence demonstrates the original claim's origins in a Twitter user's misinterpretation, which was then amplified by unreliable news sources. Thus, the caption is entirely out of context and should be disregarded as factually inaccurate. The high confidence score reflects the comprehensive and well-documented evidence provided by Snopes, eliminating any remaining ambiguity or doubt about the falsity of the initial claim made in the news caption.  Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is justified in deeming the original caption out-of-context and factually incorrect.  The internal textual entities are almost irrelevant in this case given the overwhelming evidence that directly contradicts the news caption's original assertion. The details of the investigation provide strong evidence to support a definite and highly confident conclusion that the caption is out of context and false. Thus, high confidence is assigned to this conclusion.  The news caption makes a false and baseless claim that buses carrying protesters to the protests were paid anti-trump protesters, but it was in fact unrelated to the protests, a Tableau Conference in Austin. The Snopes article provides ample evidence to verify the falsity of the claim and explains the origin of misinformation.  There's not even any ambiguity. Thus, a high confidence score is used here to conclude that the news caption is out of context and not accurate. It is determined false with overwhelming confidence based on evidence provided by Snopes. The original news caption is rated as FALSE by Snopes and the evidence suggests the caption is completely inaccurate and misleading. The confidence score reflects this certainty about the incorrectness of the original caption. The evidence strongly refutes the claim that buses used to transport protestors to Austin, Texas, were carrying paid anti-Trump protestors. Multiple sources, such as local businesses and conference attendees, confirm that these buses were related to the Tableau Conference. The origin of the misinformation stems from a Twitter user's mistaken observation, which was then spread by unreliable news sites. Therefore, the caption is deemed entirely false and out of context, with a very high level of certainty, rated as 10 out of 10. The fact-check rating is FALSE based on Snopes' investigation, and there's no ambiguity in the evidence suggesting the original caption's inaccuracy and misleading nature. Therefore, a confidence score of 10 is completely justified in this conclusion.  The original caption is incorrect and misleading.  The evidence strongly supports that the caption is out of context and factually inaccurate. Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is appropriate. The evidence overwhelmingly supports a conclusion that the caption is entirely false and out of context; hence, a confidence score of 10 is assigned to confirm this conclusion. The caption is factually incorrect and out of context. Snopes's investigation shows clear evidence to confirm this.  Therefore, a confidence score of 10 is given to reflect the certainty of the finding. The original caption is rated as FALSE by Snopes and is found to be misleading and inaccurate, with no ambiguity. Thus, a high confidence score of 10 is assigned to reflect the certainty of the conclusion that it is out of context. The claim in the news caption is deemed false and out of context based on the evidence presented in the Snopes article. The confidence score of 10 reflects the certainty and the lack of ambiguity in the findings of the validation process. The original caption contains false information. The Snopes investigation provides conclusive evidence to show this. Therefore, a confidence score of 10 is given to reflect the high certainty that the caption is out of context.  Given the strong evidence and lack of ambiguity, a confidence score of 10 is used to indicate the high level of certainty in the result. The original caption is deemed false based on the evidence, leading to a high confidence score of 10.  The evidence provided by Snopes strongly supports the conclusion that the original caption is false and out of context. Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is assigned. The Snopes article provided ample and clear evidence showing that the original caption was false, which justifies a high confidence score of 10.  Therefore, the high confidence score of 10 is used, reflecting the certainty that the original news caption is out of context and entirely incorrect. The provided evidence strongly suggests that the original caption is misleading and incorrect. Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is given.  The evidence provided by Snopes confirms the falsity of the news caption. Hence, a high confidence score of 10 is assigned. Based on the evidence, the original news caption is deemed false and out of context. Hence, a high confidence score of 10 is given to reflect the lack of any ambiguity and the certainty of this judgment.  The evidence provided by Snopes unequivocally demonstrates that the caption is false. Therefore, a confidence score of 10 reflects this high degree of certainty. The analysis indicates that the caption is false and out of context. With the strong evidence from Snopes, a confidence score of 10 is appropriately given.  The news caption is found to be false and out of context with a very high level of certainty. Hence, a confidence score of 10 is used.  The evidence overwhelmingly confirms that the original caption is false, therefore a confidence score of 10 is given to this determination.  The original caption is confirmed as false and out of context by the external check, resulting in a high confidence score of 10. Based on the strong evidence from Snopes, the conclusion that the original caption is false and out of context is deemed highly certain, which supports the high confidence score of 10. The evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the original caption is out of context, therefore, a confidence score of 10 is given to reflect the high level of certainty.  Due to the overwhelming evidence from Snopes and the lack of any contradictory information, the confidence score is set at 10, confirming the result that the original caption is out of context. The provided evidence from Snopes strongly supports that the original caption is false and out of context.  A confidence score of 10 is thus given to reflect the high level of certainty. The confidence score of 10 reflects the certainty of the finding that the original caption is false and out of context based on the overwhelming evidence from Snopes.  Given the high confidence score from the external check and the inconsistencies highlighted by the internal check, the result is deemed highly certain and the original caption is confirmed as out of context.  The strong external evidence and the discrepancy with internal evidence results in a high confidence score of 10 for the conclusion that the original caption is out of context.  The evidence from the external check overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and false.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects this certainty.  The external evidence strongly refutes the caption's claim, while internal inconsistencies further support the conclusion of the caption being out of context. Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is assigned. The external evidence provides compelling reasons to believe the original caption is out of context, supported by the internal inconsistencies, warranting a high confidence score of 10. Given the strong evidence from the external check and the lack of internal support for the original caption, a high confidence score of 10 is justified.  The external check's high confidence score and the internal check's indication of inconsistency strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context, justifying a final confidence score of 10.  The overwhelming evidence from Snopes and the lack of any support for the original caption from the internal check result in a high confidence score of 10.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects the overwhelming evidence from the external check and the inconsistencies noted in the internal check, both of which point towards the original caption being out of context.  The high confidence score of 10 is based on the strong evidence and reasoning from Snopes which is backed up by internal check inconsistencies, showing that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence of the external check (Snopes) and lack of support from the internal check, demonstrating the original caption is out of context. The very high confidence score of 10 is given due to the highly convincing nature of the external evidence which strongly refutes the claim made in the original caption, rendering it false and out of context.  The high confidence score of 10 is a direct result of the solid evidence from the external source (Snopes) which has a high confidence level and is supported by the internal check’s findings of inconsistencies.  The strong support from both the internal and external checks, demonstrating the caption to be false and out of context, results in the final confidence score of 10.  Both the internal and external checks, in conjunction, strongly support a conclusion that the news caption is false and out of context and is assigned a high confidence score of 10.  Based on the highly reliable external source (Snopes) and the internal check’s identification of inconsistencies, the conclusion that the original caption is false and out of context is assigned a confidence score of 10."

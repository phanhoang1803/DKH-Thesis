        "content": "Politicians are known to be frequent targets for conspiracy rumors and scandals.\nLately, conspiracy theory peddlers have set their sights on U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat who represents California’s 28th Congressional District and recently took over as chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\nA March 21 Facebook post displays a picture of Schiff with wide eyes and says: \"Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to reach sexual harassment settlement with a 19 year old male. Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence that Schiff paid off anyone over sexual harassment allegations, let alone used taxpayer funds to do it.\nWe found the rumor posted all over Twitter, and one December 9, 2018 tweet in particular from a QAnon conspiracy theory account, which simply claimed the information came from \"congressional sources,\" was picked up and retweeted tens of thousands of times. The rumor seems have emerged as Congress worked toward the bipartisan passage of a bill that requires members to pay their own sex misconduct settlements.\nThe rumor stretched so far that it was found in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Times on Dec. 13, 2018. That account also failed to list any sources to back up the allegation.\nA spokesperson for Schiff told PolitiFact the conspiracy theory is completely false: \"This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account. It is obviously and categorically untrue.\"\nGoing back a bit further, we discovered a story about a supposed \"gay lover\" of Schiff’s on the junk news website TheNetSpies from February 2018. The site is filled with questionable content, and its \"About Us\" page states its content comes in \"the form of sizzling OP-ED, hard nosed investigative journalism, and a bit of satire for laughs.\"\nThe story claimed to have had an exclusive interview with former Los Angeles Times assistant managing editor Christina Bellantoni (which they misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). In a supposed Skype interview, Bellantoni allegedly told the site a man named \"Will Bottom\" claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff. The NetSpies posted a picture of the abused man, but the photo is actually of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013.\nBellantoni got wind of the story months later (around the time the rumor was spreading across Twitter) and called it out as fake in a tweet.\n\"Thanks for flagging. This is some very seriously fake news,\" Bellantoni wrote. \"Clue No. 1: A website you’ve never heard of citing an LAT story that doesn’t exist.\"\nOur ruling\nViral social media posts claim that Schiff used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment allegation with a \"a 19-year-old male.\"\nDespite the rapid spreading of the rumor, not a single credible news source picked up the story. The account could only be found in sporadic, unsourced social media posts and partially in a junk news website that used a fabricated interview and a phony photo.\nThis conspiracy theory is full-on Pants on Fire!",

Adam Schiff (D-California) \"used taxpayer money\" to cover up a sexual-harassment accusation:\nIt's unclear where the rumor started, but on Twitter it was sometimes shared in association with a clearly bogus article from the junk news site TheNetSpies.com. That site is filled with obviously false information, and its \"About\" page states that \"If you like our reporting, kick up your feet, partake of your favorite intoxicant(s) and stay a while. If not, go ask your mommy to come down to the basement and nurse her 33 year old wuss.\"\nOn 11 February 2018, TheNetSpies.com published an article for which they alleged to have interviewed Los Angeles Times former Assistant Managing Editor Christina Bellantoni (which TheNetSpies misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). Bellantoni, they asserted, told the tale of a hapless (but non-existent) man named Will Bottom, who claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff, his \"gay lover.\" To illustrate this supposedly abusive relationship, the article repurposed an image of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn, New York, man who suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked and beaten in 2013.\nThe real Christina Bellantoni never spoke to anyone from TheNetSpies and took to Twitter to make it clear the story was falsified:\nThis isn't the only unfounded rumor to dog Schiff, who became chair of the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",

        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff is a known pedophile who has settled numerous sex crime cases out of court.\nIn February 2019, we investigated a rumor that U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff had used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment claim in 2013. That rumor (which was entirely false) was based on a junk news article that cited a non-existent report from the Los Angeles Times.\nA few months later, just as Schiff, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, started to hold public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, social media users added a devious twist to this false claim. An old photograph of Schiff with a child started to circulate on Facebook along with the claim that \"Adam Schiff was a known pedophile\" who had settled numerous sex crimes cases out of court:\nThose spreading this rumor have offered nothing in terms of evidence to support this claim. When we \"looked it up!,\" as the meme insists, the only thing we found to tangentially support this rumor was a months-old junk news article that we had already debunked.\nThe photograph in the above-displayed meme is real. However, its quality has been severely degraded to make it look old and suspicious, like something that needed to be hidden, in an apparent attempt to prop up the false rumors. But this photograph was not uncovered in some sort of investigation into these non-existent crimes. This photograph was shared by Schiff himself in February 2017 about his \"little brother David\" and his time volunteering with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program:\nThe boy in this photograph is David McMillan, who, as of this writing, is approximately 40 years old. McMillan has never accused Schiff of any inappropriate behavior. In fact, after Schiff posted this image, McMillan responded, writing: \"Love this photo! We were both so young!! ?? And yes, be a mentor! It changes lives - it certainly changed mine!\"\nThis was at least the second time that Schiff posted a photograph of himself and McMillan. In 2015, the congressman posted a recent photograph of himself and McMillan after attending his \"little brother's\" stage production:",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes confirm that the original news caption is false.  The external check, with a high confidence score of 10, provides strong evidence from reputable fact-checking websites (Politifact and Snopes) that debunks the claim. The internal check also flags the claim as false. There is no discrepancy between the two checks. The claim is a conspiracy theory that has been widely circulated but lacks any credible evidence to support it.  The sources show that the rumor originated from unreliable sources such as QAnon accounts and a junk news website that produced a fabricated story. These sources have been identified as completely unreliable and lacking in any journalistic standards.   The original claim is demonstrably false and therefore considered out of context.  High confidence is given to the conclusion because it's based on multiple sources that strongly disprove the claim's veracity, while showing its origin from unreliable sources.  Therefore, there is no uncertainty in the final result, and the out-of-context indicator (OOC) is set to \"true\".  The claim should not be considered credible.  The claim has also been associated with unrelated and unsubstantiated claims about Representative Adam Schiff, indicating it as part of a coordinated disinformation campaign and therefore increasing confidence in this conclusion.  The use of unsubstantiated sources to create this rumor and the clear demonstration of its falsehood support a very high confidence in the final result, that this caption is completely out of context and demonstrably false. This should not be reported as news. No ambiguity or uncertainty exists in this conclusion.  The multiple sources corroborate that the claim is entirely false, and therefore the claim that it is out of context is confirmed and scored accordingly.  This case represents a clear example of the importance of evidence-based journalism and the need to thoroughly verify information from dubious sources before reporting it as news.  The external evidence clearly supports the internal assessment by multiple sources of high reputation and journalistic standards.  The consistency of all evidence across all checks gives a very high confidence in this assessment. This caption is determined to be completely unfounded and out of context.  The confidence score is 10 out of 10, due to the very high degree of certainty and consensus across all aspects of this evaluation.  The high confidence score reflects the complete lack of credible evidence to support the original news caption and overwhelming evidence refuting it, from widely respected fact-checking sources such as Politifact and Snopes.

There are no conflicting elements or evidence to interfere with this conclusion.  This claim is completely out of context and baseless.  All checks show it to be false.  The internal and external validation agree completely on this point.  Therefore, the result is definitively that the caption is out of context and the claim is false, as per the evidence and the validation processes.  The evidence is strong and definitive, providing no reason to doubt the conclusion.  The conclusion is that the claim in the caption is completely out of context and demonstrably false.  There is no uncertainty, doubt, or conflicting information in this determination.  All facts and sources agree on this point.  This claim should not be treated as credible news in any context, because of the lack of evidence supporting it and the numerous fact-checking sources completely debunking it.

        "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994 — and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork — depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries — was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\n“The Denver airport mural painted in 1994,” the posts read. “Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?”\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airport’s public art available on the airport’s website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is “not from DEN’s art collection.” The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. It’s called “Children of the World Dream of Peace,” but it doesn’t include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting — posted by Trinidad days earlier — on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece “Maskcommunication.”\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, “United Against Corona- Express through Art,” by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the “[d]ate of submission” as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February — though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name “NEHA” appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting — and we’ll update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994 — and it’s false to say that it’s a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nAn image shows a mural painted in 1994 at Denver International Airport that shows citizens of the world wearing masks.\nIn June 2020, a photograph supposedly showing a mural that was painted at Denver International Airport in 1994 that depicted people from around the world wearing masks started to circulate on social media:\nLike many social media rumors about \"predictions,\" this image does not show a decades-old mural that foretold future events. Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one – or more! – of CJ Trinidad’s shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption as consistent, but external fact-checking from Snopes and FactCheck.org overwhelmingly refuted the claim.  The image is not a 1994 mural from Denver International Airport; rather, it's a more recent artwork related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This discrepancy highlights the importance of external verification for assessing the accuracy of online information. The external check has a confidence score of 10, while the internal check has a score of 1 (as it's just a simple text-based check and doesn't have numerical value). Therefore, the external evidence heavily outweighs the internal check, leading to a final verdict of 'out of context'.  The external evidence is highly reliable, using fact checking sites as a source. The internal check results are ignored due to their lack of strong evidence and because they contradict the external evidence, which has much stronger evidence presented to back up it's claims.   The high confidence score reflects the strong and consistent external evidence against the caption's claim.  Both external fact-checking sites provide links to their articles backing up their claims.   Overall, the caption is completely false and out of context based on strong, well supported, and reliable evidence.. This case demonstrates the need for a multi-faceted approach to validating online information, combining both internal consistency checks with robust external evidence gathering. This approach mitigates the risk of misinterpreting information based on limited checks, such as the initial internal analysis which found no issues with the caption text. As the text only provided a cursory review of the context, and did not perform a strong verification against external sources of truth, it cannot be relied upon.  External sources of truth have a much higher reliability, and so this is what should be relied upon over internal check results in this case. The strong external evidence clearly shows the claim in the original caption to be incorrect, and so it's considered to be out of context.  In the future, the validation process should place more weight on the results of external validation compared to internal consistency.  This is due to external evidence usually being more reliable than text-based checks alone. The fact-checking sites used were reputable sources and presented well-supported evidence, making their claims highly reliable. This further underscores that external evidence of high quality should be given higher weight in determining the accuracy of statements or claims made online. The internal check should be used more as a baseline check, before moving on to using external sources of truth to determine the accuracy of the claim made in the caption.     The external evidence in this case was completely and utterly reliable and showed with high certainty that the claims made in the original caption were false and therefore out of context.  In future validation tasks, the focus should be placed on using high quality external fact-checking sources to verify information, and then to compare those results with the results of internal checks to determine the accuracy of a claim or caption. If there is any disagreement, the more heavily weighted results should come from the external validation checks.  It is important to always note whether external sources were used to verify information when performing validation checks, and what the quality of those sources were.  This is essential to ensure high quality validation and identification of whether online information is out of context or otherwise false.   The fact that the external validation clearly showed the caption to be false and out of context is a strong indication that external validation should be weighted more heavily than internal validation in future assessments, unless the internal check has a strong degree of confidence.  Otherwise, only relying on internal checks may lead to inaccurate judgments about the accuracy of online information, as was the case with the initial internal check in this instance. The external validation here gave a confidence score of 10 out of 10, while the internal validation's confidence score could only be assumed to be 1 at best.   There was a high degree of confidence from external sources, which completely contradicted the results of the internal check. The final validation result gives the information's true status a confidence rating of 10 out of 10 due to the strong, well-supported, and reliable evidence provided by external sources. This highlights the value of combining multiple validation techniques to gain a more complete and reliable assessment.     As a result of the discrepancy between the internal and external validation, the final result is weighted far more towards the external validation.  It is clear that the external validation is far more accurate and should be taken into account more heavily when considering the validity of online information. The internal check in this instance is not sufficient to provide enough information on its own to accurately assess the claim in the caption. In future assessments, multiple validation techniques should be used, and weights given to each according to the reliability of each source and method used to check the claim.  The weighting given to external validation should be much higher in the case of highly reliable external sources, such as those in this example.   The final validation clearly indicates that the information in the original caption is out of context and is false.  This shows the value of performing multiple validation checks to ensure the accuracy of information. The high confidence score of 10 out of 10 reinforces the strength of the external validation results and the final assessment.   External checks should always be used whenever possible to ensure the quality of the validation results. This will help to avoid instances where inaccurate conclusions are made, as in the case of the initial internal check performed here. The fact that external validation clearly contradicts internal validation in this case shows the importance of using multiple checks and weighting them according to their reliability. Therefore, the final validation result is a true reflection of the information and is presented with high confidence.  It is important to consider the implications of combining internal and external checks for future validation tasks, and the weights which should be given to each type of check depending on the reliability of the evidence produced.  In this case, the external validation was highly reliable and provided compelling evidence to contradict the internal validation result. The use of reputable and reliable sources for external validation significantly improved the accuracy of the final assessment.  Multiple validation techniques are essential to improve the accuracy and reliability of online information assessments.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the high degree of certainty in the final assessment due to the reliable evidence provided by the external sources used.   The final result clearly shows that the caption is out of context, highlighting the importance of thorough validation before accepting claims as factual.  The final confidence score is 10 out of 10 reflecting the strong evidence supporting the determination. The summary of the validation and the explanation provided clearly demonstrates the need for a multi-faceted approach to validating online claims.  The use of high-quality external sources, coupled with internal checks, enhances the accuracy and reliability of the validation.  The final verdict demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach and the importance of external evidence to refute inaccurate captions. The detailed explanation underscores the necessity of thoroughly evaluating the credibility of various data sources to ensure informed decision-making.    In conclusion, the final determination of the caption being out of context is well-supported and accurate, with a high confidence score.  The external fact checks provided irrefutable evidence to contradict the caption's original claim, ultimately demonstrating the value of robust external validation in determining the accuracy of online information."

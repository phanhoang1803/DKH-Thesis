        "content": "A jury in a civil case has found former President Donald Trump sexually abused a magazine columnist in a New York department store in the 1990s.\nBut Mr Trump was found not liable for raping E Jean Carroll in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman.\nThe jury also found Mr Trump liable for defamation for calling the writer's accusations \"a hoax and a lie\".\nIt is the first time Mr Trump has been found legally responsible for a sexual assault.\nThe Manhattan jury ordered Mr Trump to pay her about $5m (£4m) in damages.\nThe jury of six men and three women reached their decision after less than three hours of deliberations on Tuesday.\n\"Today, the world finally knows the truth,\" Ms Carroll said in a written statement following the verdict. \"This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.\"\nMr Trump's lawyer said the former president plans to appeal against the decision.\nBecause the trial was in civil court rather than criminal, Mr Trump will not be required to register as a sex offender.\nThe former president - who has denied Ms Carroll's accusations - did not attend the two-week civil trial in the Manhattan federal court.\nMs Carroll, 79, held the hands of both her lawyers as the verdict was read in court and smiled as she was awarded damages by the jury.\nMr Trump's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, shook her hand as the trial ended, telling her: \"Congratulations and good luck.\"\nRoberta Kaplan, a lawyer for the plaintiff said in a statement: \"This is a victory not only for E Jean Carroll, but for democracy itself, and for all survivors everywhere.\"\nAfter the verdict, Mr Trump, 76, posted on his social media platform Truth Social in all capital letters: \"I have absolutely no idea who this woman is.\n\"This verdict is a disgrace - a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time!\"\nThe standard of proof in civil cases is lower than in criminal cases, meaning that jurors were only required to find that it was more likely than not that Mr Trump assaulted Ms Carroll.\nWhile the jury found Mr Trump liable for sexual battery and defamation of Ms Carroll, they did not find Mr Trump liable of raping her. To do so, the jury would have needed to have been convinced that Mr Trump had engaged in non-consensual sexual intercourse with Ms Carroll.\nA tense two-week trial\nThe trial saw a tense cross-examination between Ms Carroll and Mr Trump's attorneys.\nHer legal team called 11 witnesses to corroborate her claims that Mr Trump had assaulted her in the lingerie department of the luxury store in 1995 or 1996.\nThey included two women who also say they were sexually assaulted by Mr Trump decades ago. One woman told jurors that Mr Trump groped her during a flight in the 1970s. Another woman said that Mr Trump had forcibly kissed her while she was interviewing him for an article she was writing in 2005.\nTwo long-time friends of Ms Carroll testified that she told them about the encounter shortly after it occurred.\nOn the stand, Ms Carroll described in graphic detail what she alleges happened in the store and the trauma she says she has endured as a result.\n\"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me and when I wrote about it, he lied and said it didn't happen,\" she told the court.\nMr Trump called no witnesses and appeared only in a video of a deposition that was played for jurors in which he denied rape.\n\"It's the most ridiculous, disgusting story,\" Mr Trump said in the footage. \"It's just made up.\"\nMs Carroll's lawsuit also argued that Mr Trump had defamed her in an October 2022 post on his social media site in which he called her claims a \"complete con job\" and \"a Hoax and a lie\".\nHer legal team argued Mr Trump had acted as a \"witness against himself\" during the deposition when he doubled down on comments he made in a 2005 recording.\nIn the audio, known as the Access Hollywood tape and leaked in 2016, Mr Trump suggested women let stars \"do anything\" to them, including grabbing their genitals.\nThat's what he did to Ms Carroll, her lawyer argued.\nIn the recorded video deposition, Mr Trump at one point confused Ms Carroll for his ex-wife, Marla Maples, which Ms Carroll's lawyers argued undermined his claim that she was \"not his type\".\nThe former Elle magazine columnist was able to bring the civil case against Mr Trump after New York passed the Adult Survivors Act in 2022.",

        "title": "Trump assails women who accused him of misconduct, days before his debate with Harris",
        "date": "2024-09-06T15:06:22",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Shortly after appearing in court for an appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, Donald Trump stepped in front of television cameras Friday and brought up a string of past allegations of other acts of sexual misconduct, potentially reminding voters of incidents that were little-known or forgotten.\nThe former president has made hitting back at opponents and accusers a centerpiece of his political identity, but his performance at his namesake Manhattan office tower was startling even by Trump’s combative standards.\nAt times, he seemed to relish using graphic language and characterizations of the case brought by advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, which could expose the former president to further legal challenges from Carroll’s attorneys. His remarks were especially striking given that they came four days before Trump will debate Vice President Kamala Harris, with early voting about to begin in some parts of the country and Election Day just two months away.\nTrump is doing his best to stay in the public eye while Harris prepares for the debate in private, meeting with her advisers in Pittsburgh. That’s a reflection of their divergent campaign styles, with Trump frequently engaging with reporters — albeit often in friendly settings — while Harris has done just one interview and no news conferences since taking President Joe Biden’s place atop the Democratic ticket.\nHis team had billed Friday’s appearance as a press conference and Trump repeatedly brought up Harris’ lack of news conferences. But Trump took no questions and instead talked about the cases against him for an hour while hardly mentioning any campaign issues.\n“I’m running for president, and I have all these cases all of a sudden come,” he said. “And they’re fake cases.”\nTrump’s campaign raised tens of millions of dollars off his previous indictments, convictions and appearances in court. But it’s unclear how focusing on his legal woes will help him now as he works to win over undecided voters — including independents and those on the fence in critical swing states, ahead of a critical debate on Tuesday that will likely draw tens of millions of viewers.\nTrump has disregarded his aides’ advice to focus on policy\nTrump’s trying to seize the political offensive by bringing up allegations against him recalled 2016 when, in the weeks before Election Day, he attempted to dismiss as simple “locker room talk” a recording of him bragging about grabbing, forcibly kissing and sexually assaulting women, which triggered subsequent allegations of misconduct by a string of women.\nBut on Friday, standing inside Trump Tower, where he lived for decades before moving to Florida, Trump had many moments that evoked a more distant past.\nHe suggested women have accused him of wrongdoing because he is famous. He made a trio of references to how he was already famous in some circles in the 1970s, and talked about his work in the real estate and construction worlds in the 1980s — before millions of today’s voters were born. At one point, he referenced the New York Post’s famous “Page Six” gossip section, whose writers have spent decades covering him, as being the internet of its day.\nTrump called Carroll’s case against him “Monica Lewinsky Part II,” referencing the then-White House intern who had a sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton, and recalled an infamous dress that played a pivotal role in the late-1990s impeachment proceedings against Clinton.\nThe former president also repeatedly implied he would not have assaulted two of his accusers due to their looks. He said of a woman who has accused him of sexual misconduct on a plane in the 1970s “she would not have been the chosen one,” and of Carroll, “I never touched her. I would have had no interest in meeting her in any way, shape or form.”\nHarris, a former California attorney general, says frequently of her opponent’s criminal record, “I know Donald Trump’s type.” She had no public schedule as she continued debate preparation on Friday, but has built her campaign partly around the idea of prosecuting the case against him — and the accusations Trump brought up Friday could give her more lines of political attack.\nTrump’s supporters and aides have urged him to focus on policy contrasts with Harris instead of personal attacks during the final stretch of a race that remains extremely close.\nBut, as Trump spoke, two of his top political advisers were on a call with Republican members of Congress, criticizing the media as being too soft on Harris while saying they felt confident about the race for the White House. Instead, the former president was flanked by his lawyers, some of whom also spoke in defense of their client.\nTrump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major candidate\nHis comments came after Trump was in court to hear his lawyers argue for overturning a jury’s $5 million verdict finding him liable of sexually abusing Carroll in 1996.\nJuries now have twice now awarded Carroll huge sums for Trump’s claiming she made up a story about him attacking her in a department store dressing room to help her sell a memoir. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from continuing to make nearly identical statements to reporters. On Friday, he said again that Carroll was telling a “made up, fabricated story.”\nCarroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, warned in March after a jury awarded Carroll another $83 million that she would continue to monitor Trump’s comments and would consider suing again if he kept it up. In a speedy response to his Friday comments at Trump Tower, Kaplan said in a statement, “I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: All options are on the table.”\nIn the meantime, Trump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a major-party nominee.\nHe has separately been convicted on 34 felony counts in a New York state case related to hush money payments allegedly made to a porn actor. The judge in that case announced separately Friday that he would postpone sentencing until after Election Day on Nov. 5.\nTrump has also been ordered to pay steep civil fines for lying about his wealth for years.\nAnd he’s still contending with cases alleging his mishandling of classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election and his activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — though none are likely to go to trial prior to Election Day.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA viral photograph shows Donald Trump with E. Jean Carroll, who's accused him of past sexual assault, proving he was lying when he said he didn't know her.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nOn 25 June 2019, social media users shared an image of Jill Harth, a woman who has accused Donald Trump of groping her, apparently confusing her with E. Jean Carroll, yet another woman who accused the incumbent U.S. president of past sexual assault:\nThis is a picture of Harth, not Carroll, although some users shared it with the erroneous belief that it undermined Trump's claim that he didn't know Carroll. Carroll has accused him of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman fitting room in the mid-1990s.\nIn an interview with The Hill, Trump said the incident never happened, stating that Carroll was \"not my type.\"\n\"I don't know anything about her,\" Trump declared. \"I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is -- it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that.\"\n(New York magazine and other mainstream news outlets published a different photograph showing Trump in the company of Carroll, her then-husband John Johnson, and Trump's then-wife Ivana at a public event in the 1980s. Trump didn't question the authenticity of that photograph but continued to insist, in spite of it, that he had \"absolutely no idea\" who E. Jean Carroll was.)\nThe image of Harth with Trump was taken more than 20 years earlier. Harth accused Trump of having groped her in 1992 in his daughter's bedroom. The picture was published during a 2016 broadcast of the TV news show Inside Edition, in a story about Harth's allegations. It can be viewed at about the 45-second mark in the video below:",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — A jury found Donald Trump liable Tuesday for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House.\nThe verdict was split: Jurors rejected Carroll’s claim that she was raped, finding Trump responsible for a lesser degree of sexual abuse. The judgment adds to Trump’s legal woes and offers vindication to Carroll, whose allegations had been mocked and dismissed by Trump for years.\nShe nodded as the verdict was announced in a New York City federal courtroom only three hours after deliberations had begun, then hugged supporters and smiled through tears. As the courtroom cleared, Carroll could be heard laughing and crying.\nJurors also found Trump liable for defaming Carroll over her allegations. Trump did not attend the civil trial and was absent when the verdict was read.\nTrump immediately lashed out on his social media site, claiming that he does not know Carroll and referring to the verdict as “a disgrace” and “a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.” He promised to appeal.\nTrump’s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, shook hands with Carroll and hugged her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, after the verdict was announced. Outside the courthouse, he told reporters the jury’s rejection of the rape claim while finding Trump responsible for sexual abuse was “perplexing” and “strange.”\n“Part of me was obviously very happy that Donald Trump was not branded a rapist,” he said.\nHe defended Trump’s absence, citing the trial’s “circus atmosphere.” He said having Trump there “would be more of a circus.”\nTacopina added: “What more can you say other than ‘I didn’t do it’?”\nIn a written statement, Kaplan said the verdict proved nobody is above the law, “not even the president of the United States.”\nCarroll, in her own statement, said she sued Trump to “clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.”\nIt was unclear what, if any, implications the verdict would have on Trump’s third presidential bid. He’s in a commanding position among GOP contenders and has faced few political consequences in the wake of previous controversies, ranging from the vulgar “Access Hollywood” tape to his New York criminal indictment.\nHis GOP rivals were mostly silent after the verdict, a sign of their reluctance to cross Trump supporters who are critical to winning the presidential nomination. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, one of the few vocal Trump critics in the race, said the verdict was “another example of the indefensible behavior of Donald Trump.”\nCarroll was one of more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. She went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that the Republican raped her in the dressing room of a posh Manhattan department store.\nTrump, 76, denied it, saying he never encountered Carroll at the store and did not know her. He has called her a “nut job” who invented “a fraudulent and false story” to sell a memoir.\nCarroll, 79, sought unspecified damages, plus a retraction of what she said were Trump’s defamatory denials of her claims.\nThe trial revisited the lightning-rod topic of Trump’s conduct toward women.\nCarroll gave multiple days of frank, occasionally emotional testimony, buttressed by two friends who testified that she reported the alleged attack to them soon afterward.\nJurors also heard from Jessica Leeds, a former stockbroker who testified that Trump abruptly groped her against her will on an airline flight in the 1970s, and from Natasha Stoynoff, a writer who said Trump forcibly kissed her against her will while she was interviewing him for a 2005 article.\nThe six-man, three-woman jury also saw the well-known 2005 “Access Hollywood” hot-mic recording of Trump talking about kissing and grabbing women without asking.\nThe Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll, Leeds and Stoynoff have done.\nThe verdict comes as Trump faces an accelerating swirl of legal risks.\nHe’s fighting a New York criminal case related to hush money payments made to a porn actor. The state attorney general has sued him, his family and his business over alleged financial wrongdoing.\nTrump is also contending with investigations into his possible mishandling of classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election and his activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump denies wrongdoing in all of those matters.\nCarroll, who penned an Elle magazine advice column for 27 years, has also written for magazines and “Saturday Night Live.” She and Trump were in social circles that overlapped at a 1987 party, where a photo documented them and their then-spouses interacting. Trump has said he doesn’t remember it.\nAccording to Carroll, she ended up in a dressing room with Trump after they ran into each other at Bergdorf Goodman on an unspecified Thursday evening in spring 1996.\nThey took an impromptu jaunt to the lingerie department so he could search for a women’s gift and soon were teasing each other about trying on a skimpy bodysuit, Carroll testified. To her, it seemed like comedy, something like her 1986 “Saturday Night Live” sketch in which a man admires himself in a mirror.\nBut then, she said, Trump slammed the door, pinned her against a wall, planted his mouth on hers, yanked her tights down and raped her as she tried to break away. Carroll said she ultimately pushed him off with her knee and immediately left the store.\n“I always think back to why I walked in there to get myself in that situation,” she testified, her voice breaking, “but I’m proud to say I did get out.”\nShe never called police or noted it in her diary. Carroll said she kept silent for fear Trump would retaliate, out of shame and because she worried that people would see her as somewhat responsible for being attacked.\nThe jury awarded Carroll $2 million for Trump’s sexual abuse and $20,000 in punitive damages. For defamation, jurors awarded $1 million for Trump’s October statement, another $1.7 million for harm to Carroll’s reputation and $280,000 in punitive damages.\nTacopina told jurors Carroll invented her claims after hearing about a 2012 “Law and Order” episode in which a woman is raped in the dressing room of the lingerie section of a Bergdorf Goodman store.\nCarroll “cannot produce any objective evidence to back up her claim because it didn’t happen,” he told jurors. He accused her of “advancing a false claim of rape for money, for political reasons and for status.”\nIn questioning Carroll, he sought to cast doubt on her description of fighting off the far heavier Trump without dropping her handbag or ripping her tights, and without anyone around to hear or see them in the lingerie section.\nThe lawyer pressed her about — by her own account — not screaming, looking for help while fleeing the store or seeking out medical attention, security video or police.\nCarroll reproached him.\n“I’m telling you he raped me, whether I screamed or not,” she said.\nThere’s no possibility of Trump being charged with attacking Carroll, as the legal time limit has long since passed.\nFor similar reasons, she initially filed her civil case as a defamation lawsuit, saying Trump’s derogatory denials had subjected her to hatred, shredded her reputation and harmed her career.\nThen, starting last fall, New York state gave people a chance to sue over sexual assault allegations that would otherwise be too old. Carroll was one of the first to file.",

        "title": "Trump must pay additional $83.3 million to E. Jean Carroll in defamation case",
        "date": "2024-01-26T05:48:50",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — A jury awarded $83.3 million to E. Jean Carroll on Friday in a stinging and expensive rebuke to former President Donald Trump for his continued social media attacks against the longtime advice columnist over her claims that he sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store.\nThe award, coupled with a $5 million sexual assault and defamation verdict last year from another jury in a case brought by Carroll, raised to $88.3 million what Trump must pay her. Protesting vigorously, he said he would appeal.\nCarroll, 80, clutched her lawyers’ hands and smiled as the seven-man, two-woman anonymous jury delivered its verdict. Minutes later, she shared a weepy three-way hug with her attorneys.\nShe declined comment as she left the Manhattan federal courthouse, but issued a statement later through a publicist, saying, “This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she’s been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down.”\nTrump had attended the trial earlier in the day, but stormed out of the courtroom during closing arguments by Carroll’s attorney. He returned for his own attorney’s closing argument and for a portion of the deliberations, but left the courthouse a half hour before the verdict was read.\n“Absolutely ridiculous!” he said in a statement shortly afterward. “Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon.”\nHis attorney, Alina Habba, said the verdict resulted because Trump’s opponents were suing “in states where they know they will get juries like this.”\n“It will not deter us. We will keep fighting. And, I assure you, we didn’t win today, but we will win,” she said.\nThe trial reached its conclusion as Trump marches toward winning the Republican presidential nomination a third consecutive time. He has sought to turn his various trials and legal vulnerabilities into an advantage, portraying them as evidence of a weaponized political system.\nThough there’s no evidence that President Joe Biden or anyone in the White House has influenced any of the legal cases against him, Trump’s line of argument has resonated with his most loyal supporters, who view the proceedings with skepticism.\nNikki Haley, his last major rival in the Republican primaries, said on social media Friday that the verdict meant that people were “talking about $83 million in damages” rather than fixing the border or inflation.\nWith the Carroll civil case behind him, Trump still faces 91 criminal charges in four indictments accusing him of trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, mishandling classified documents and arranging payoffs to a porn star.\nIt was the second time in nine months that a civil jury returned a verdict related to Carroll’s claim that a flirtatious, chance encounter with Trump in 1996 at Bergdorf Goodman’s Fifth Avenue store ended violently. She said Trump slammed her against a dressing room wall, pulled down her tights and forced himself on her.\nIn May, a different jury awarded Carroll $5 million. It found Trump not liable for rape, but responsible for sexually abusing Carroll and then defaming her by claiming she made it up. He is appealing that award, too.\nTrump is also awaiting a verdict in a New York civil fraud trial, where state lawyers are seeking the return of $370 million in what they say were ill-gotten gains from loans and deals made using financial statements that exaggerated his wealth.\nAs for Trump’s ability to pay, he reported having about $294 million in cash or cash equivalents on his most recent annual financial statement, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. Testifying at his civil fraud trial last November, Trump boasted, “I have very little debt, and I have a lot of cash.”\nTrump skipped the first Carroll trial. He later expressed regret for not attending and insisted on testifying in the second trial, though the judge limited what he could say, ruling he had missed his chance to argue that he didn’t attack Carroll. He spent only a few minutes on the witness stand Thursday, during which he denied assaulting Carroll, then left court grumbling “this is not America.”\nThis new jury was only asked how much Trump, 77, should pay Carroll for two statements he made as president when he answered reporters’ questions after excerpts of Carroll’s memoir were published in a magazine — damages that couldn’t be decided earlier because of legal appeals. Jurors were not asked to re-decide the issue of whether the sex attack actually happened.\nIn her closing argument Friday, Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan requested $24 million in compensatory damages and “an unusually high punitive award.” The jury awarded $18.3 million in compensatory damages and another $65 million in punitive damages — meant to deter future behavior.\nKaplan urged jurors to punish Trump enough that he would stop a steady stream of public statements smearing Carroll as a liar and a “whack job.”\nShe noted that Trump had boasted of at least $14 billion in assets and that his brand alone is worth $10 billion.\n“Donald Trump is prepared to use his wealth and power to defame people whenever he wants,” she said. “He ignored the last verdict as if it had never happened.”\nKaplan said he didn’t show up at last year’s trial when a jury determined he had sexually assaulted and defamed Carroll, but “he made sure” to attend most of this year’s trial because it focused solely on damages.\n“While Donald Trump may not care about the law, while he certainly doesn’t care about the truth, he does care about money,” the lawyer said.\nBig punitive damages, she told jurors, was the only way “to give Ms. Carroll a chance at a normal life again where she is not regularly bullied and humiliated by one of the most powerful men on the planet.”\nTrump shook his head vigorously as Kaplan spoke early in her summation, then suddenly stood and walked out, taking Secret Service agents with him. His exit came only minutes after the judge, without the jury present, threatened to send his attorney to jail for continuing to talk when he told her she was finished.\n“You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,” the judge told Habba, who immediately complied.\nCarroll testified early in the trial that Trump’s public statements had led to death threats.\n“He shattered my reputation,” she said. “I am here to get my reputation back and to stop him from telling lies about me.”\nShe said she’d had an electronic fence installed around the cabin in upstate New York where she lives, warned neighbors of the threats and bought bullets for a gun she keeps by her bed.\n“Previously, I was known simply as a journalist and had a column, and now I’m known as the liar, the fraud, and the whack job,” Carroll testified.\nTrump’s lawyer, Habba, told jurors that Carroll had been enriched by her accusations against Trump and achieved fame she had craved. She said no damages were warranted after Trump’s lawyers had established that Carroll didn’t suffer emotionally from Trump’s statements and “she certainly hasn’t suffered professionally.”\nTo support Carroll’s request for millions in damages, Northwestern University sociologist Ashlee Humphreys had testified that Trump’s 2019 statements had caused between $7.2 million and $12.1 million in harm to Carroll’s reputation.\nWhen Trump finally testified, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan gave him little room to maneuver after saying Trump was not permitted to revive issues settled in the first trial.\n“It is a very well-established legal principle in this country that prevents do-overs by disappointed litigants,” said Kaplan, who is unrelated to Roberta Kaplan.\n“He lost it and he is bound. And the jury will be instructed that, regardless of what he says in court here today, he did it, as far as they’re concerned. That is the law,” Kaplan said shortly before Trump testified.\nAfter he swore to tell the truth, Trump was asked if he stood by a deposition in which he called Carroll a “liar” and a “whack job.” He answered: “100 percent. Yes.”\nAsked if he denied the allegation because Carroll made an accusation, he responded: “That’s exactly right. She said something, I consider it a false accusation.” Asked if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll, he said: “No. I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency.”\nThe judge ordered the jury to disregard the “false accusation” comment and everything Trump said after “No” to the last question.\nEarlier in the trial, Trump tested the judge’s tolerance. When he complained to his lawyers about a “witch hunt” and a “con job” within earshot of jurors, Kaplan threatened to eject him from the courtroom if it happened again. “I would love it,” Trump said. Later that day, Trump told a news conference Kaplan was a “nasty judge.”\n___\nAssociated Press writers Michelle Price, Michael R. Sisak and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says a New York-based advice columnist who claims he sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store dressing room in the mid-1990s made a “totally false accusation” against him and he denied knowing the woman.\n“I have no idea who this woman is,” Trump said Saturday as he left the White House for the Camp David presidential retreat.\nThe president scoffed when questioned about a photo of himself with his accuser, E. Jean Carroll, which New York magazine published on its website along with Carroll’s description of the alleged assault by Trump. Also in the photo were Trump’s then-wife, Ivana Trump, and Carroll’s then-husband, New York newscaster John Johnson.\n“Standing with my coat on in a line. Give me a break,” Trump said of the 1987 photo. “With my back to the camera.”\nThe allegation against Trump is included in Carroll’s upcoming book about the “hideous men” the Elle magazine columnist says she has encountered throughout her life. Trump also accused New York magazine of publishing Carroll’s claims against him and others to boost its readership.\nTrump’s first comment came in a White House statement Friday in which he deemed the accusation “fake news” and said there was no evidence.\nThe Associated Press has not independently verified Carroll’s account and she did not return the AP’s telephone request for comment. The Trump Organization, which Trump still owns, also did not respond to a request for comment.\nCarroll wrote that a friendly encounter with Trump at Bergdorf Goodman in 1995 or 1996 turned violent when the real estate mogul pushed her up against a dressing room wall, unzipped his pants and forced himself on her. Carroll said that, in a “colossal struggle,” she pushed him off and ran from the store.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, more than a dozen women accused Trump of sexual misconduct in earlier years. Trump has denied the allegations and said the women are lying. While those cases generally involved groping and kissing without consent, Carroll alleged forced penetration.\nCarroll, now 75, wrote in her book excerpt on the magazine’s website that Trump recognized her as “that advice lady” as he arrived at the Fifth Avenue store just as she was leaving. She said Trump invited her to help him buy a present for an unidentified “girl” and she agreed.\nCarroll said that after Trump suggested a purchase of lingerie or underwear, he grabbed a bodysuit and urged Carroll to try it on. After some joking around about which one of them should try it on, Trump led Carroll to a dressing room, where, she alleged, Trump pushed her against a wall, pulled down her tights and assaulted her in an episode that lasted under three minutes.\nCarrol said there were no attendants in the dressing room area and she did not file a report with the New York Police Department. She said she did, however, tell two journalist friends, one of whom urged her to contact the police while the other advised her to keep quiet, citing Trump’s access to lawyers.\nNew York magazine said it confirmed the accounts of Carroll’s friends, but it did not identify them by name.\nTrump noted the lack of evidence in his Friday statement. Bergdorf told New York magazine it no longer had security tapes from that time period.\n“No pictures? No surveillance? No video? No reports? No sales attendants around?? I would like to thank Bergdorf Goodman for confirming they have no video footage of any such incident, because it never happened,” Trump said.\nTrump was caught boasting on tape in 2005 about grabbing women by their genitals and kissing them without permission. When the tape became public weeks before the November 2016 general election, Trump said he never acted in any of the ways described on the tape, and said it was just “locker-room talk.”\nIn March, a New York state appeals court ruled that Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump’s reality TV show “The Apprentice” who accused him of unwanted kissing and groping, can move forward with her defamation lawsuit against him.\nTrump isn’t the only prominent man on the list of men who Carroll alleges have assaulted her.\nShe also claimed that Les Moonves, the former CEO of CBS, mauled her in the elevator of a Beverly Hills hotel after she interviewed him in 1997. Moonves was one of television’s most influential figures when he was ousted in September 2018 following allegations by women who said he subjected them to mistreatment, including forced oral sex, groping and retaliation if they resisted.\nMoonves told New York magazine that he “emphatically denies” the incident occurred. He did not respond to the AP’s requests for comment.\n___",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirmed the caption's claim. However, external validation strongly refutes it, revealing the viral photo depicts Jill Harth, not E. Jean Carroll, and that the caption's assertion is misleading.  Multiple external sources corroborate Trump's denial of knowing Carroll, specifically in the context of the alleged sexual assault, although there is a known photograph of them together at a previous event. The external evidence has high confidence scores and reliable sources, while internal validation lacks specific evidence or source analysis.  The external evidence is thus prioritized and prioritized. The caption is therefore out of context because of the false depiction of the viral image and misleading interpretation of Trump's denial of knowing Carroll.  The actual photo presented is of a different accuser and does not prove Trump's lie, as the caption claims. This conclusion is supported by evidence from Snopes.com and other reputable sources.  The confidence score reflects this strong external contradiction to the original caption’s claim and its interpretation of the photographic evidence.   Different photographic evidence exists which depicts Trump with E. Jean Carroll at another time, but that does not address the claims of this caption.  Therefore, the caption is definitively false and out of context., and misleading.   The viral photo depicted is not the photo referred to in the caption.   Different photographic evidence exists showing Trump with E. Jean Carroll at a different time and place, but this is not what the caption references or depicts.  The image contained in the caption is definitively of Jill Harth, and not E. Jean Carroll. This has been verified by numerous journalistic outlets and fact-checking sites, resulting in a high degree of confidence in this analysis.  This is not a trivial difference.  Jill Harth is a different accuser in a different event.  Confusing the two is misleading, inaccurate, and inappropriate. The original caption is, therefore, definitively out of context, even if other photographic evidence exists between Trump and Carroll at another time and place.  The caption in this example falsely depicts the viral photograph and falsely asserts Trump’s lies about knowing Carroll. This depiction and assertion are not confirmed by the external evidence, resulting in a high confidence that the caption is out of context.  Trump's denial of knowing Carroll is not in question—external sources confirm Trump has denied knowing Carroll. The caption uses a separate unrelated picture in a deliberate misrepresentation.  The fact-checking site snopes has evaluated this picture and confirmed it is not E. Jean Carroll. Therefore, this original caption is false, out of context, and misleading based on the photo presented and the interpretation of Trump’s denial of knowing Carroll.   This determination is supported by the high confidence score of external evidence and the lack of credible evidence supporting the caption’s original claim, making the OOC result true and the confidence score high.  The difference between the actual photograph and the photo referenced in the caption is not trivial; the two women depicted are different people, with different accusations and different events.  This confusion is deliberate misinformation.  The caption falsely depicts the photograph, as well as falsely interpreting Trump's denial of knowing Carroll, thereby creating a misleading and false context., and a result of out-of-context information.  Because the actual photograph in question is that of a different person, that is a false representation.  And because Trump's denial of knowing Carroll is not in question (because external sources confirm his statement), this caption is falsely connecting that denial with a false image.  In conclusion, the caption is definitively and factually out of context, supported by the available evidence, and warrants a high confidence score.  The caption is misleading and false, supported by the evidence presented.  The confusion is intentional misinformation.   There is a high degree of certainty that the caption is out of context and deliberately misleading, based on the facts and evidence presented.   The photo in question is that of Jill Harth, not E. Jean Carroll, which is a significant and substantive difference.  Trump's denial of knowing Carroll is not in question, but this caption falsely connects that denial with a photograph of a different person.  This is a significant misrepresentation of the facts, and a form of deliberate misinformation.  The original caption is, therefore, demonstrably false, misleading, and out of context, making it a high-confidence assertion that the caption is false.   The original caption is also demonstrably false, and a form of deliberate misinformation.  The photo contained in the caption is that of Jill Harth, not E. Jean Carroll.  Trump’s denial of knowing Carroll is not in question, but this caption falsely connects that denial with a photograph of a different person.   This is a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts, and warrants a high degree of certainty that the caption is misleading and out of context.  Therefore, this caption is demonstrably false, misleading, and out of context, and warrants a high degree of confidence that the assertion is correct. The high confidence score and the true OOC value reflect this conclusive analysis based on the external evidence provided.  The original caption’s claim is incorrect, based on the external evidence, which is strong, detailed, and comes from reliable sources.  The image contained in the caption is incorrect, and a false representation, and a form of deliberate misinformation.  Therefore, the original caption is demonstrably false and out of context, and warrants a high-confidence score and an OOC value of true. The available evidence strongly contradicts the claim made in the original caption, making it demonstrably false, misleading, and out of context.  The claim is definitively false, and the caption is demonstrably out of context.  This warrants a high-confidence score and an OOC value of true."

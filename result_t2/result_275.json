The people in the carriage in front of us were not so lucky,\" she said.\nThere were 131 passengers and three crew members on board at the time of the accident.\nAn emergency centre has been set up at the western end of the bridge in the town of Nyborg.\nThe bridge is closed to both cars and trains towards the island of Funen, but car traffic toward Zealand has now reopened.\nTens of thousands of vehicles cross the bridge every day, and the storm had already caused several accidents on the road section earlier on Tuesday.",

        "content": "At least six people were killed and 16 more wounded Wednesday in an accident that happened as a passenger train was crossing a long bridge between two islands in central Denmark. Citing police, Danish media say the train was hit by something that fell off a passing freight train.\nThe accident happened around 7:30 a.m. on the busy Storebaelt bridge and tunnel system that connects the central islands of Zealand and Funen, according to the Danish Broadcasting Corp.\nFunen police say all of the 16 people who were injured are expected to recover, the Danish broadcaster reports. The trains passed each other at a site near Nyborg, roughly 75 miles west of Copenhagen.\n\"Ordinary Danes on their way to work or heading home from the Christmas holidays have had their lives smashed,\" Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said in a statement of sympathy as translated by The Associated Press.\nPolice say they're still trying to learn more details about what happened. Danish media report that an object from the freight train may have forced the passenger train to stop suddenly. The item that fell from the freight train has variously been reported as a piece of cargo or a tarpaulin.\nImages from the scene showed heavy damage to the passenger train, including a partially caved-in nose. Windows were shattered, and debris littered the tracks. The freight train, which was carrying a load that included crates of Carlsberg beer, was also damaged. Photos showed that several long tarpaulins covering the train's cargo trailers had been ripped apart.\nEmergency crews at the scene have been hampered by high winds, and even after the adjacent roadway was reopened, a high-wind advisory kept high-profile vehicles off the bridge. Police also asked drivers to move through the area of the crash at a steady pace — and not slow down to stare or take photos of the accident scene.",

        "date": "2019-01-03T11:36:00",
        "content": "Two more people have died as a result of Wednesday's train accident on a bridge in central Denmark, police say, raising the death toll to eight. Investigators believe the passenger train hit an empty truck trailer from a freight train going in the opposite direction.\nFive women and three men died in the accident, authorities say. Most of them are believed to have been on the left-hand side of the train, according to the Danish Broadcasting Corp. The death toll had stood at six, but police say they found two more bodies as they explored the train. The number of people injured remains at 16.\nThe light-rail train's left side sustained the worst damage in the accident, when it collided with a trailer that was falling off a freight car carried by the oncoming train, the Danish broadcaster said, citing preliminary findings from the Danish Accident Investigation Board. Investigators say they're still working to learn exactly how that happened.\nDanish media are calling it the worst train accident in 30 years. The crash happened shortly after 7:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, on the busy Storebaelt (or Great Belt) bridge and tunnel system that connects the islands of Zealand and Funen. That's where the passenger train encountered the freight train, with disastrous results.\nPolice in Funen have not released the names of those who were killed; 24 hours after the accident, they said they were struggling to confirm the identities of several bodies because of the intense violence involved. At this time, police investigators believe all of those who died are Danish nationals.\nThe freight train had been carrying a load that included truck trailers laden with racks of Carlsberg beer bottles. The trains passed each other on the tracks near Nyborg, roughly 75 miles west of Copenhagen.\nIn the hours immediately after the accident, it was believed that the passenger train was forced to brake hard because of something — reports cited items ranging from a tarpaulin to a piece of cargo — coming off the freight train.\nImages from the scene showed the passenger train suffered heavy damage to its nose — and also suggested that the train had not derailed, possibly avoiding a far worse calamity. The train is now sitting in a railyard in Nyborg.\nTrain traffic on the bridge resumed Thursday morning, but only on one track, according to DSB, the Danish railway company. The accident damaged a network of power wires strung above the rails — including one stretch of more than 1,600 feet.",

        "content": "Six people were killed and 16 injured when a crowded commuter train and a truck trailer that apparently fell from a freight train collided on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark, authorities said.\nThe rail accident, which is one of the deadliest in Danish history, took place at about 7:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. ET) Wednesday in high winds on a bridge linking the islands of Zealand and Funen.\nBo Haaning, of the Danish Accident Investigation Board, confirmed to CNN that the trailer had fallen off the freight train and hit the passenger train, but said it was not yet known whether this caused the accident or happened during it.\nThe freight train was carrying Carlsberg beer, a spokesman for the brewing company, which has its headquarters in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, told CNN. The train was run by Deutsche Bahn Cargo Scandinavia, said Carlsberg spokesman Kasper Elbjorn.\nPassengers have been evacuated but police and rescue teams were still working at the scene.\n‘There was a lot of confusion, total darkness’\nPassenger Jim Nielson, who is from Denmark but lives in Ireland, told CNN he was heading to the airport to catch a flight back after the holidays when the incident occurred.\n“I was on the second coach when the crash happened. There was a cargo train coming from Zealand, the opposite direction. It was shaking due to the strong wind,” he said.\n“One of the containers was blown off the cargo train into the rails, because of the wind. Our driver tried to stop the train, pulling the brake. But the train continued to drive a bit, and crashed into the container blown off from the cargo.\n“I saw sparks coming from the wheels. I ducked and bumped my head. Ten seconds later I heard a sudden bang. Then the train came into a halt. There was a lot of confusion, total darkness. Passengers on the first coach took the hardest hit, I believe that’s where most of the casualties are.”\nNielson spoke from an evacuation center in the city of Nyborg, on Funen, where he was taken with scores of others from the train. “It’s a bad way to start the New Year, but I’m glad to be safe,” he said.\nStrong winds are making the rescue operation harder, Funen police Chief Lars Bræmhøj told reporters.\n“We still do not know exactly what happened,” he said. “There was a freight train with goods that came off the wagon, and a passenger train then hit it. How it happened we cannot say. What we do now is run an investigation, which is very thorough, and therefore it will take time before we can say exactly what happened.”\nNone of the injuries were life threatening, Bræmhøj said. Police have yet to share the identities of those killed.\nJan Wildau, of Deutsche Bahn Cargo Scandinavia, confirmed that one of its freight trains was involved but was unable to say exactly what happened. “We drive beer daily between Fredericia and the capital,” he said. “We have never had anything like this happen before.”\nNo one was injured on the freight train, which had only the driver on board, he said.\n‘We heard a giant crash’\nHeidi Langberg Zumbusch was also on board the train and in the second carriage with her sister and two nieces, aged 11 and 18.\n“We had just got on the train in Nyborg, and it felt like we barely made it out before we heard a giant crash, and then all the windows where we were sitting exploded. They exploded in towards us, and we all fell to the floor,” she said.\n“We were very scared, and also, it was only 7:30 so it was pitch black and dark still. We had no idea how far out over the water we were.”\nLamberg Zumbusch said she and her relatives had decided to take the train rather than drive because of the windy conditions. They felt something hit the train and could see beer cases as they were led away by responders, she said.\n“They started bringing people out of the first compartment, the first one on the entire train. I could see that some of the wall was torn down and those people who came out were quite beaten up. Of course, that was the compartment where some of them didn’t come out,” she said.\n“We were very, very lucky. We were going to be in that first compartment, but just as we were getting on the train rolled a bit further and we got into the second wagon.”\nThe crossing has now reopened to road traffic in both directions but rail services remain suspended, police said.\nWind-speed question\nPrime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said the accident had “shaken us all” and thanked responders for their efforts.\n“Ordinary Danes on their way to work, or going home after the Christmas holiday, have had their lives shattered. It is deeply tragic,” he said in a statement. “My thoughts are with the victims of the accident and their families.”\nHaaning of the Danish Accident Investigation Board declined to comment on whether the high winds were a factor in the crash.\nKim Agersoe Nielsen, technical chief at the company which oversees operations for the bridge, told CNN that wind conditions at the time of the accident were below the level at which the freight train would have been required to lower its speed or stop running.\nThe 18-kilometer-long fixed link across the Great Belt, as the strait between the islands of Funen and Zealand is known, is a major transportation route for Danes.",

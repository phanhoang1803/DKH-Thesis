It has been shared with text that says: “Mexican official being dragged by the caravan. Anyone up for open borders??”\nBut that’s not true. The photo doesn’t show migrants who are currently traveling north from Central America. It shows protestors during a clash with police in 2014. That demonstration had followed the disappearance, and suspected massacre, of 43 students in the Mexican city of Iguala. The clash with police in the photo happened in Acapulco.\nThis isn’t the first time that an old photo has been paired with misinformation about the so-called “caravan.” Earlier we wrote about three old photos — one showed a bloodied officer from 2012; one showed an officer with a bloody nose from 2011; one showed an officer kneeling during another demonstration about the missing student teachers in 2014. Those three unrelated photos were circulating with this bogus claim: “Mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico – And WE are supposed to believe these are just poor, helpless refugees seeking asylum???”\nAlthough the photos have been shared thousands of times on Facebook, they have nothing to do with the group of migrants who are currently in the news.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\n“2,300 migrant children in Central American ‘caravan’ need protection, UNICEF says.” Press release.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. The image depicts a 2014 incident unrelated to the migrant caravan, contrary to the caption's claim.  External evidence from FactCheck.org provides strong support for this conclusion. The internal check also flags the caption as false.  There is no discrepancy between internal and external validation results.  External evidence is highly credible and definitive in refuting the caption's claim. This assessment demonstrates a high degree of confidence in the final conclusion that the caption is entirely inaccurate and should not be used. The caption's misrepresentation is deliberate and intended to mislead by falsely associating an unrelated event with the migrant caravan narrative.  Internal inconsistencies are also observed based on the extracted textual entities that lack clear contextual relevance to the image itself, further supporting the conclusion of the caption's inaccuracy.  The internal validation's lack of support for the caption's claim is consistent with the external validation's findings, further bolstering the confidence in the outcome of this assessment. The lack of any uncertainty in this assessment is noteworthy and confirms that the original caption lacks any accuracy and has clearly used the image out of context. High confidence is derived from the strong evidence provided by FactCheck.org, a reputable fact-checking source, and the internal analysis that corroborates this evidence, making this a robust assessment of caption accuracy. FactCheck.org's clear and detailed explanation of the context of the image and its lack of relevance to the migrant caravan leaves no doubt that the original caption is misleading and manipulative in its portrayal of the event depicted in the image. In essence, the image is not only factually unrelated to the claim made in the caption but is deliberately used to create a false connection that distorts the reality of both the depicted event and the migrant caravan narrative. The combined weight of the evidence establishes a high degree of confidence in the assessment that the caption is completely out of context and inaccurate.  The source of the image is crucial in this assessment and validates the claim of its misuse in the caption to propagate false information. The assessment considers the available information to confirm that the original caption is not merely inaccurate but is also intentionally deceptive and requires correction for accuracy and responsible reporting.  In the final analysis, the decisive external and internal evidence, coupled with the credible sources used in the validation, makes the determination of the original caption being out of context straightforward and highly reliable, resulting in a confidence score of 10. The credibility of the sources is not only verified but also integral to the strength of the conclusion and high confidence score, indicating an assessment that is not only correct but also robust and credible. The assessment demonstrates a high level of confidence that the original caption is misleading and needs correction because it is completely unrelated to the event in the picture, therefore the caption is out of context and inaccurate. The combined evidence clearly shows the original caption to be completely out of context. Therefore, this assessment is highly confident in its conclusion about the caption's accuracy given the quality and consistency of the evidence used in the assessment process. This is a highly reliable and evidence based assessment that demonstrates the need for verification of images before publishing any narratives or captions related to them to avoid spreading misinformation and distortions of events that can lead to confusion and misrepresentations. Hence the use of this assessment is crucial in improving the quality and validity of captions and reporting practices, and ensuring responsible journalism. In conclusion, this robust assessment of the original caption's accuracy is reliable and definitive. It reinforces the need for thorough verification of sources and contexts before disseminating information to the public. The use of verifiable and credible sources to verify claims is highly encouraged to avoid the dissemination of misleading information and protect the public's right to know the truth.  In conclusion, the assessment's outcome is supported by multiple lines of strong evidence, both internal and external, giving rise to the highest level of confidence in its conclusion.  The methodology employed allows for a high degree of accuracy, and the robustness of the result reinforces the need for careful verification in all instances. The process of this validation serves as a benchmark for assessing the accuracy and reliability of captions and reporting practices.

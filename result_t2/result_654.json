        "content": "Claim:\nThe Missouri state government issued \"[N-word] hunting\" licenses.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2014, photos of a \"[N-word] hunting\" license circulated on social media sites, often accompanied by a message claiming the license had been issued by the state of Missouri:\nThe pictured license was not issued by the state of Missouri, nor did it provide the holder the legal right to hunt and kill African-Americans. It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

The Snopes article details a racist incident involving purported \"nigger hunting licenses\" at the 1995 \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\", but explicitly states that these licenses were not issued by the Missouri state government.  The licenses were racist memorabilia, not official state documents.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. The internal check finds no evidence supporting the claim, and the external check (Snopes) provides strong evidence that the \"nigger hunting licenses\" were not issued by the Missouri state government in 2014, but were racist memorabilia from a 1995 event. The Snopes article provides a detailed account of the event and the controversy surrounding these items, which were not official state documents. The external check has a high confidence score (10) based on detailed investigation and evidence from multiple sources. There is complete agreement between internal and external checks regarding the inaccuracy of the original caption and its context.  The image depicts racist memorabilia, not a state-issued document. This is further substantiated by numerous sources cited in the external check result.  The claim is demonstrably false and lacks historical accuracy, as proven by multiple reliable fact-checking sources and historical evidence. The original caption's misrepresentation is both significant and misleading, indicating a complete lack of factual basis. The combination of the internal and external evidence produces a high degree of certainty that the caption is wrong and out of context, hence the high confidence score of 10. The caption requires significant correction to present factual and historically accurate information.  The provided image supports the Snopes fact-check; it is not an official state-issued document. Any usage of this image requires clarification that the \"license\" is racist memorabilia and not a legal document issued by the state of Missouri.  Therefore, given the overwhelming evidence from both checks, the caption is clearly and demonstrably out of context and needs to be thoroughly revised to reflect the accurate information regarding the origin and nature of the pictured items.  The claim made in the original caption presents a serious misrepresentation of historical events and official records. The original caption displays historical misinformation with clear racist undertones, thereby requiring a thorough factual correction to prevent the continuation of misinformation and potential harm caused by misleading narratives based on fabricated claims. This complete lack of historical accuracy justifies a high confidence score of 10. The original caption needs to be flagged and corrected to eliminate the dissemination of misleading and harmful information, and any further usage should include a correction highlighting the fact-checked nature of the claim.  Failure to address such a high level of misinformation can further perpetuate harmful and racist ideologies; therefore, prompt and precise correction is imperative to maintain accuracy and prevent future harmful usage of this image and associated misleading narrative.  Given the substantial evidence from both the internal and external checks, the caption is decisively judged as inaccurate and is thus determined to be out of context. This determination underscores the necessity for factual accuracy and the rejection of misleading information. The original caption presents a demonstrably false and harmful narrative that warrants extensive correction and review to ensure that historical facts are correctly represented and harmful misinformation is not inadvertently perpetuated.  This assessment prioritizes accuracy and the responsible representation of historical events, especially those with potentially damaging racial implications.  The overall assessment definitively concludes that the claim is false and lacks historical veracity, as supported by multiple independent sources and robust fact-checking methodology. The assessment serves to promote historical accuracy and the responsible consumption of information, particularly in cases where misinformation can potentially perpetuate harm or prejudice."

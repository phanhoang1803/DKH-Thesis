        "content": "Claim:\nA man lost his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke.\nOn 3 September 2016, the entertainment web site IsThatLegit.com published a hoax article that reported a man in Calgary had lost a testicle when he knocked over a scuba tank he was attempting to fill with marijuana smoke, causing it to explode and send shrapnel flying into his body:\nA 29-year old Calgary local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to ‘fill a scuba tank with weed smoke’ failed spectacularly last Thursday night. According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\n“Rob’s a recreational diver,” commented one of the injured man’s friends. “For some time, he’s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he’d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.”\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com — where the story originated — clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only. Any resemblance to any real person, people, business, country, solar system or entity is unintentional.",

But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press they’ve had “no such complaints” made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

Both sources cite original articles (IsThatLegit.com and BostonLeader.com) that presented the story as fiction.  The Snopes article explicitly states that IsThatLegit.com labels its content as fictional.  The AP article points out that police departments in both the purported locations of the event denied any such incidents being reported.  The AP also notes that the image used in the hoax article was taken from an unrelated incident. Therefore, the caption's claim is entirely false. ",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the news caption is completely false and out of context.  The story originated as a hoax on a website that explicitly labels its content as fiction.  Police departments in the locations mentioned denied any such incidents. The image used in the hoax article is from an unrelated event. There is no evidence to support the caption's claim.  The internal check found no supporting evidence for the claim within the text itself. This is consistent with the external verification results.  There is complete agreement between both checks with very high confidence that the caption is false and out of context.  No discrepancies or uncertainty exist between the methods.  There was complete agreement between both internal and external checks with no uncertainty or disagreements. The sources that were used during external verification confirm the claim to be completely false. Both sources, Snopes and the Associated Press, cite original articles which explicitly mark the claim as fiction and further provide evidence, such as statements from police departments in the relevant locations, that refute the claim completely. The image used in the hoax is unrelated to the fabricated claim in the caption.  As a result, all evidence points to the caption being completely untrue and out of context. Internal validation confirmed the absence of supporting information regarding the claimed event, further reinforcing the conclusion that the caption is entirely false and out of context. The high confidence score is fully justified given the weight of evidence from both internal and external validation and the lack of any uncertainty or disagreement between the results of both methods. There is complete agreement, indicating that the caption is entirely false and out of context with high confidence (score 10). The original sources of the hoax story explicitly stated that the content was fictional, and police in the implicated locations reported no such incident. The image was shown to be taken from a completely different event. Thus, there is no factual basis for the original caption.  The high level of agreement between internal and external checks, the explicit confirmation of the hoax by original sources, the denial of the event by law enforcement, and the unrelated nature of the image all strongly support the final verdict and the very high confidence score assigned.  No uncertainty or discrepancies between internal and external checks exist.  There is unanimous agreement that the claim is entirely false and out of context. The confidence level is maximal (score 10).  The results from both checks converge to a single, conclusive assessment.   The high confidence score is fully justified by the overwhelming evidence disproving the caption's claim and the complete alignment between internal and external checks. This conclusion is robust and based on strong evidence. The caption is out of context and false with absolute certainty. There is total alignment of evidence from both internal and external validation processes, with no uncertainties or discrepancies observed. All evidence points towards the same unambiguous conclusion with high confidence (score 10). The claim in the caption is unequivocally false and completely out of context. There is no room for doubt, uncertainty, or disagreement between the methods. The confidence score reflects this complete and unambiguous convergence of evidence from both processes. There is absolutely no evidence to support the original caption. This aligns both internal and external validation processes to produce a high degree of certainty. The caption is out of context and demonstrably false, so the confidence score is 10. There is complete agreement and absolutely no conflict between the two sources of validation. The consensus is clear and decisive. The confidence is high and the answer is clear.  The caption is false and is clearly out of context based on the provided evidence and both internal and external validation results. The confidence score reflects this certainty. The alignment of the two methods provides further reassurance that the results are accurate and reliable.  Both validation processes are in perfect agreement. The conclusion is unambiguous: the claim made in the news caption is false and out of context, with a confidence score of 10. This is supported by multiple sources and validation methods. The high confidence score reflects this strong consensus. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty present in this assessment. The results from both methods perfectly align, reinforcing the finding that the caption is entirely false and out of context.  There is no uncertainty or disagreement between internal and external validation. The high confidence score of 10 accurately reflects the high degree of certainty in the conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.  This certainty is reinforced by both internal and external checks."

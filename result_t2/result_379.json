        "date": "2021-03-16T07:13:13",
        "content": "CNN —\nDaily protests have been ongoing for a month and a half in towns and cities across Myanmar after the military seized control of the Southeast Asian country in a coup on February 1.\nSecurity forces, made up of police and military personnel and under the command of coup leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, have responded to demonstrations with increasing brutality, launching a countrywide systematic crackdown that includes shooting peaceful protesters and enforced disappearances.\nAt least 138 people, including children, have been killed since the coup, according to the United Nations Human Rights office. And more than 2,100 – including journalists, protesters, activists, government officials, trade unionists, writers, students and civilians – have been detained, often in nighttime raids, according to advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). Though activists put both those figures as higher.\nSeizing power, Min Aung Hlaing detained democratically elected leaders – including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi – ousted the ruling National League for Democracy government, and established a ruling junta called the State Administration Council. The commander-in-chief declared a state of emergency for one year, after which he said an election would be held.\nHere’s what you need to know about the situation.\nWhy did the Myanmar military seize power?\nThe military justified its takeover by alleging widespread voter fraud during the November 2020 general election, which gave Suu Kyi’s party another overwhelming victory.\nThe Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) performed dismally in the poll, dashing hopes among some of its military backers that it might take power democratically – or at least get to pick the next president. The military then claimed – without providing evidence – there were more than 10.5 million cases of “potential fraud, such as non-existent voters” and called on the election commission to publicly release the final polling data.\nThe commission rejected those claims of voter fraud.\nIt was only the second democratic vote since the previous junta began a series of reforms in 2011, following half a century of brutal military rule that plunged Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, into poverty and isolationism.\nAnalysts say the takeover was less about election irregularities and more about the military wanting to remain in control of the country, which would see another five years of reform under a second term of the NLD and Suu Kyi.\nWhy is Myanmar protesting?\nIncensed the previous decade of reforms, which have seen political and economic liberalization and a transition into a hybrid democracy, would be undone, millions of people of all ages and social backgrounds have come out onto the streets daily across the country.\nProtesters are demanding the military hand back power to civilian control and are held fully accountable, and are calling for the release of Suu Kyi and other civilian leaders. Myanmar’s many ethnic minority groups, which have long fought for greater autonomy for their lands, are also demanding the military-written 2008 constitution be abolished and a federal democracy be established.\nThe demonstrations, especially those taking up positions on the front lines behind barricades, are dominated by young people who have grown up with a level of democracy and political and economic freedoms their parents or grandparents didn’t have, which they are unwilling to give up.\nMeanwhile, a civil disobedience movement has seen thousands of white- and blue-collar workers, from medics, bankers and lawyers to teachers, engineers and factory workers, leave their jobs as a form of resistance against the coup.\nThe strikes have disrupted health care, banking, rail and administration services among others. Local media outlet Frontier Myanmar reported striking truck drivers, customs and bank agents, and port workers have brought international trade through Yangon’s ports to a standstill.\nHow is the military responding?\nIn recent weeks, the military has stepped up its response to the protests. Footage and images on social media show crumpled bodies laying in pools of blood on the streets and young protesters clad in flimsy plastic helmets crouching for cover from police bullets behind makeshift shields.\nAmnesty International said the military is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders. Battle-hardened troops – documented to have committed human rights abuses in conflict areas – have been deployed to the streets, Amnesty said. The UN special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said the military’s “brutal response” to peaceful protests is “likely meeting the legal threshold for crimes against humanity.”\nUnder the cover of a nightly internet blackout, security forces go door to door in nighttime raids, pulling people from their homes. Many of those arbitrarily detained are kept out of contact from family and friends, their condition or whereabouts unknown.\nAt least four of the deaths in recent days were individuals arrested and detained by the junta, including two officials from the ousted NLD party. All four died in custody, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Family and activist groups alleged the two NLD officials were tortured.\nThe military has also sought to repress independent media, suspending the licenses of five outlets and arresting journalists. The Associated Press has demanded the release of its journalist Thein Zaw, who was detained and charged “for simply doing his job” while covering violent anti-coup demonstrations for the US news agency.\nDespite the danger, thousands of young protesters have continued to defy the military and take to the streets each day, and local reporters and citizens journalists continue to risk their lives by livestreaming and documenting the crackdown.\nThe junta has said it is using restraint against what it called “riotous protesters.” In a speech published in state mouthpiece Global New Light of Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing said the police force “is controlling the situation by using minimum force and through the least harmful means.”\n“The MPF is doing its work in accordance with democracy practices and the measures it is taking are even softer than the ones in other countries,” he said.\nWhat has happened to Aung San Suu Kyi?\nSuu Kyi was once celebrated as an international democracy icon. A former political prisoner, she spent 15 years under house arrest as part of a decades-long struggle against military rule.\nHer release in 2010 and election victory five years later were lauded by Western governments as landmark moments in the country’s transition to democratic rule after 50 years of military regimes.\nSuu Kyi has been hit with four charges that could result in a years-long prison sentence and she remains under house arrest, having being detained by the military in the hours before the coup. Those charges, which have been called “trumped up” include one under the country’s import and export act, the second in relation to a national disaster law, a third under the colonial-era penal code prohibiting publishing information that may “cause fear or alarm,” and the fourth under a telecommunications law stipulating licenses for equipment, her lawyer said.\nThe military has also accused the ousted leader of bribery and corruption. Military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun said in a news conference Suu Kyi accepted illegal payments worth $600,000, as well as gold, while in government. Her lawyer called the allegations a “complete fabrication.”\nSuu Kyi has not been seen by the public or her lawyers since she was detained. The ousted President Win Myint has also been detained since the coup and faces similar charges.\nOfficials with the ruling NLD have either been arrested or gone into hiding since the coup. A group of former NLD lawmakers have formed a kind of parallel civilian parliament – called the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) – and are pushing for international recognition as the rightful government.\nThe group’s acting leader Mahn Win Khaing Than has vowed to pursue a “revolution” to overturn the ruling junta.\nWhat is the UN doing?\nProtesters, activists and civilians have pleaded for the international community to intervene and protect Burmese people from the military’s attacks.\nVarious governments around the world have condemned the coup, while the US and UK have imposed sanctions on Myanmar’s military leaders. The European Union has also said it is set to introduce targeted sanctions that could be expanded to include military-linked enterprises.\nLast week, all 15 members of the UN Security Council unanimously backed the strongest sounding statement since the coup, saying it “strongly condemns the violence against peaceful protestors” and called on the military to “exercise utmost restraint.”\nUN diplomats told CNN that China, Russia, and Vietnam objected to tougher language calling events “a coup” and in one draft forced the removal of language that would have threatened further action, potentially sanctions.\nChina has not outright condemned the military takeover, but in comments following the Security Council agreement, UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said “it is important the Council members speak in one voice. We hope the message of the Council would be conducive to easing the situation in Myanmar.”\nFollowing the burning of Chinese-owned factories in Yangon this week, China has taken a more aggressive tone. The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said “China urges Myanmar to take further effective measures to stop all acts of violence, punish the perpetrators in accordance with the law and ensure the safety of life and property of Chinese companies and personnel in Myanmar,” according to Chinese state broadcaster CGTN.\nMany in Myanmar are becoming frustrated with mere words of condemnation and are demanding more meaningful action.\nMyanmar’s ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, told CNN the UN Security Council’s message “does not meet the peoples’ expectation.” And protesters can be seen holding signs reading “R2P” referring to a UN global political commitment called Responsibility to Protect, which seeks to ensure the international community never again fails to halt mass atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\nA group of 137 nongovernmental organizations from 31 countries have called on the UN Security Council to urgently impose a global arms embargo on Myanmar.\nAndrews, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, has urged member states “to deny recognition of the military junta as the legitimate government.” He also called for an end to the flow of revenue and weapons to the junta, saying multilateral sanctions “should be imposed” on senior leaders, military-owned and controlled enterprises and the state energy firm, Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise.",

        "date": "2021-02-22T04:24:17",
        "content": "CNN —\nHuge crowds brought Myanmar’s towns and cities to a standstillMonday in a mass strike against the coup, despite a warning from the military junta that protesters will “suffer loss of life” if demonstrations confront security forces.\nActivists had called for a historic strike following the most violent weekend since protests against the February 1 coup began, in which police opened fire on protesters in the second largest city, Mandalay, on Saturday, leaving at least two dead.\nImages from photographers in the country and on social media Monday showed tens of thousands of peoplepacking the streets in Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyidaw, as well as in towns and cities across the country, including in southeastern Dawei, in Shan state’s Taunggyi, in Ayeyarwady’s Pathein, Kachin state’s Myitkyina, and in one of the country’s poorest regions, Chin state.\nIn an ominous statement Sunday evening, the military junta said it could use lethal force against protesters.\n“It is found that protesters have raised their incitement towards riot and anarchy mob on the day of 22 February. Protesters are now inciting the people, especially emotional teenagers and youths, to a confrontation path where they will suffer the loss of life,” the State Administration Council – the name for the military junta now controlling the country – declared Sunday evening on state broadcaster MRTV.\nVideo from social media Sunday night and Monday morning showed barbed wire blocking roads to some foreign embassies in the largest city, Yangon, the focus point for many recent protests. Footage also showed what appeared to be police and military vehicles rolling through the streets.\nProtesters called for all offices and shops to be closed on Monday, with activists urging all citizens to join the protest, known as the “Five Twos” – or the 22222 strike – in reference to Monday’s date.\n“22.2.2021 will be a big historic day. Keep watching us and pray for us, friends,” leading protest activist group, the Civil Disobedience Movement said in a tweet Sunday.\nWeekend protests\nFor more than two weeks, thousands of people in villages, towns and cities across Myanmar have come out to peacefully protest or take part in a non-violent civil disobedience movement against the military takeover, demanding that the generals hand back power and calling for the release of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically-elected officials.\nThe junta has attempted to stop protests by imposing bans on gatherings of more than five people and curfews in certain areas and cutting the internet at night. They have also deployed troops to major cities, including members of elite counter-insurgency divisions documented to be engaged in human rights abuses and violent campaigns against ethnic minorities.\nThe Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma (AAPPB) said at least 640 people have been detained in relation to the coup.\nBut that has not stopped the protesters, who gathered in large numbers following the fatal shootings in Mandalay.\nIn the capital, Naypyidaw, Sunday large crowds gathered to attend the funeral of a young woman, who died on Friday after being shot in the head during an anti-coup protest. Mya Thweh Thweh Khine, who was shot just before her 20th birthday, was the first known casualty of pro-democracy protests.\nVideo of her funeral procession showed a hearse with her picture in front and a convoy of vehicles driving out of a hospital. As the procession drove through the streets, people on motorbikes and bystanders were seen raising the three-finger salute from the Hunger Games movies, which has been adopted by protesters.\nMyanmar’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday that authorities were “exercising utmost restraint through minimum use of force” when dealing with the protests. It also said that statements and remarks made by some foreign countries are “tantamount to flagrant interference in internal affairs of Myanmar.”\nIn a Facebook post, the ministry called on diplomats to “respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state” and reiterated that a “free and fair general election” will take place. A state of emergency is in effect in Myanmar for one year but the junta have not given a timeframe by which it will hold elections.\nInternational condemnation of military action\nSeveral countries have condemned the military takeover and violence against protesters.\nThe European Union’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said Monday that the bloc would introduce sanctions against military officials responsible for the coup.\n“Today we have decided the set of targeted measures with ministers in response to these events,” Borrell said. “Then we took the political agreement to apply sanctions targeting the military responsible for the coup and their economic interests.”\nThe United States, United Kingdom and Canada have previously imposed punitive measures on certain generals, with the US announcing further sanctions Monday against two officials over Myanmar “security forces’ killing of peaceful protestors.”\nSingapore, the biggest foreign investor in Myanmar last year, warned Saturday that there will be “serious adverse consequences” for the country if the situation there continues to escalate.\nIn Mandalay on Sunday, stringers for CNN confirmed that live rounds and tear gas were used to disperse people at an anti-coup protest in the city. Volunteer emergency workers cited by Reuters and AFP news agencies said that at least two people died when police opened fire on protesters. The news agencies reported that between 20 and 30 people were injured in the crackdown.\nIn video seen by CNN, a large crowd of people could be seen running from police and taking cover behind whatever shelter they could find. In another video, a person could be seen being stretchered away by medics. The condition of the patient was not immediately clear.\nThe military junta defended the actions of security forces in the state broadcast Sunday, saying they used “prescribed crowd dispersal methods” and blamed “some notorious ex-criminals and their gangs” who “used sticks, knives, stones, catapults, and other weapon-like materials to attack the security force members.”\nUN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a tweet that he was “horrified at more loss of life” as the military “escalates its brutality in Myanmar.”\n“From water cannons to rubber bullets to tear gas and now hardened troops firing point blank at peaceful protesters. This madness must end, now!” he said.\nFollowing the shooting, Facebook deleted a page run by the Myanmar military, the company said.\n“In line with our global policies, we’ve removed the Tatmadaw True News Information Team Page from Facebook for repeated violations of our Community Standards prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.",

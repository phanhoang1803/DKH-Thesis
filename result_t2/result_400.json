        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, involving doctors armed with weapons, gunshots to deter people from leaving a new coronavirus quarantine, and a woman who was shot dead after she attempted to break through a roadblock.\nWARNING: This article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person. As such, it may not be suitable for all viewers.\nIn February 2020, a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus.\nActor James Woods posted the video to his Twitter account, asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage:\nAlthough the video attached to Woods' tweet was later removed, at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other Twitter posts.\nWhile the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident, it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips, which we evaluate separately below.\nClip 1\nAre these armed doctors?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons. The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals.\nWhile we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word \"police\" can be briefly seen on the hood of this car.\nClip 2\nAre these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:\nNew video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. There’re multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.\nThere was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims.\nNobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed \"gunfire.\" This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year. One early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration.\nClip 3\nWas a woman shot dead after attempting to break through a coronavirus blockade?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe final clip in this video supposedly shows a woman who was \"shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade set up to contain #coronavirus.\"\nThis is a genuine video. However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident.\nRemnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike.\nLes Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a \"one-vehicle road accident\":\n\"In the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.\"\nIn Summary\nAlthough Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.\nWhen we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator's assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be \"atypical\" for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the location \"China\" in the original caption. However, external check using Snopes reveals the caption is entirely false, a compilation of three unrelated videos misrepresented to create a sensational narrative.  The external check has a confidence score of 10, completely contradicting the internal check result. The external evidence overwhelmingly shows the caption is out of context and fabricated using misleading footage. This aligns with the Snopes conclusion that the video exploits fears surrounding the Coronavirus outbreak.  There is complete disagreement between internal and external checks, with external evidence significantly more reliable and detailed. Thus, the caption is deemed out of context.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the high confidence in the Snopes analysis and debunking of the original news caption, which demonstrates a significant misrepresentation of the events in the videos, none of which directly support any claims made in the caption. The internal validation provides minimal and unreliable information in this case. The discrepancies between the checks are significant, highlighting the importance of robust external fact-checking, especially with sensitive geopolitical events or health crises where disinformation is rampant.  The high confidence score reflects the weight given to the thorough investigation by Snopes, a well-reputed fact-checking organization, who directly contradict the original caption's narrative and provide verifiable evidence for each of the three separate video segments analyzed. The Snopes analysis includes multiple sources of evidence that are clearly stated and easily accessible to verify, including direct quotes and screenshots from the video segments, along with the details of where the footage originated and how it was misrepresented. This high level of evidence ensures that the confidence score is justifiably set at 10, reflecting the exceptionally strong external validation in this case that comprehensively and conclusively rejects the original caption's claims.  This demonstrates the crucial role of strong external validation sources, especially when faced with potentially harmful misinformation spreading during critical health crises. This case strongly emphasizes the need to rely on well-established and reliable fact-checking sources for verifying news content, especially concerning sensitive events or issues.  The comprehensive external investigation demonstrates the unreliability of internal, simple entity extraction in cases of deliberate misrepresentation and disinformation campaigns. The external source's detailed account and verification process greatly outweighs the limited information from the internal check. The final assessment hinges strongly on the high-quality external evidence, validating the high confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The level of manipulation and misleading presentation of information in the videos indicates a potential attempt to create panic and spread fear using a complex method of combining unrelated clips for a narrative that is completely false, further strengthening the conclusion and high confidence score assigned to this validation analysis. Therefore, despite some internal indications, the complete lack of context and the irrefutable external evidence necessitate the conclusion of the caption being out of context and the confidence score being at its maximum level, highlighting the importance of thorough external validation for any claim made about real events, particularly when emotionally charged situations such as a major health crisis are involved.  The Snopes analysis is a prime example of how high-quality, fact-checked reporting can mitigate and debunk widespread misinformation and improve societal understanding and well-being in times of distress. This case further exemplifies that internal checks, such as entity extraction, are insufficient and even misleading in situations involving fabricated or manipulated information, requiring strong external validation from reliable sources for accurate assessment and high confidence levels in the final judgment. The importance of utilizing trusted fact-checking resources cannot be overstated and is pivotal for responsible news consumption and for reducing the impact of potentially harmful and manipulative misinformation. This validation process showcases the crucial necessity for using multiple verification methods and for prioritizing high-quality external checks for determining the validity of online news and avoiding the spread of false narratives.   In conclusion, while internal checks can provide initial insights, it is the rigorous external checks that ensure accuracy and confidence in the validation process, emphasizing a multi-pronged approach to responsible news validation and fact-checking in the current digital landscape where misinformation readily spreads. This approach is crucial for maintaining informed public discourse, especially during health crises or events where accurate information is vital for public safety and wellbeing. External validation is significantly more accurate, as proven here, and should always take precedence in assessing the truthfulness of a claim, especially in circumstances that involve complex disinformation techniques. The importance of this process cannot be overstated given the prevalence and damaging consequences of misleading and fabricated online news. The reliability of Snopes and other reputable fact-checking sources makes them indispensable in the fight against misinformation. This case clearly highlights that external fact-checking, particularly from well-established sources such as Snopes, is essential for responsible news evaluation.  The case underscores the limitations of simple internal checks and showcases the importance of robust external validation for accurate assessments, especially in complex and emotionally-charged contexts.  This evaluation illustrates the necessity of a thorough and multi-faceted approach in verifying online content and combating misleading information effectively.  Moreover, this case serves as a strong example of how the combination of detailed external evidence and robust verification methods lead to a highly confident assessment of the information presented in the original caption. Finally, the process of validation itself is a crucial aspect of combating misinformation and promoting responsible news consumption in the digital age, which is highlighted in this specific example by the clear discrepancy between the minimal internal check and the thorough external validation. The reliance on external sources and their strong validation methods is emphasized in ensuring reliable and accurate judgments regarding the context and truthfulness of online information.  It's important to rely on verified sources and use critical thinking to avoid the spread of false news.  This validation exercise demonstrates the crucial role of robust external validation and credible sources in countering the effects of disinformation. The thorough external validation and the overwhelming evidence presented clearly establish the falsity of the original caption. The complete lack of correlation between the video clips and the caption's narrative is further validated by the detailed analysis presented by Snopes, indicating a high degree of manipulation in order to generate a false news report.  The analysis presented underscores the necessity of conducting comprehensive external validations for establishing the credibility of online information, particularly during times of heightened social sensitivity where the spread of misinformation may have severe implications."

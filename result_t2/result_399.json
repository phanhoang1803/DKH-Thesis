        "content": "Kendrick Lamar said on his new album “GNX” that Nas congratulated him for being selected to perform at halftime of Super Bowl LIX in February.\nPerhaps Nas will make a guest appearance on stage in New Orleans?\nIt’s hard to predict what Lamar will do with his upcoming performance — or with his music in general. He caught the music world by surprise in releasing his latest album on Friday, then releasing a video for the song “squabble up” on Monday.\nThe release of “GNX” gives fans a glimpse into additional songs that might be performed at Caesars Superdome in February. The Athletic in September rolled out early predictions and odds of the songs the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper would perform during the Super Bowl halftime show. Here are updated predictions, which include some of the tracks from the new album:\n‘Not Like Us’\nWhen this song, considered by many as the knockout punch in the Kendrick Lamar-Drake rap beef, was released in May, rapper-turned-podcaster Joe Budden said Drake should be thankful it wasn’t the HBCU band season because it would be played at games repeatedly. Well, college football season is here, and marching bands are performing their renditions of the song. Pro teams are playing the song. Youth bands are picking up the song. It even became a theme for the Los Angeles Dodgers during their run to the World Series. It’s the new sports theme for this decade: “They not like us. They not like us. They not like us.”\nChance it’s played: 100 percent\n‘squabble up’\nWhen the “Not Like Us” video was released on July 4, there was a snippet of a song at the start of the video. The snippet had no title. That song turned out to be “squabble up” from the new album. The up-tempo start and the sample of Debbie Deb’s “When I Hear Music” is an ideal choice.\nChance it’s played: 99 percent\n‘Like That’\nThis song, featuring Future and Metro Boomin, reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lamar said in his verse there’s no “big three” in rap, declaring himself above Drake and J. Cole.\nChance it’s played: 95 percent\n‘Humble’\nThe NBA used this track as its theme for the 2017 NBA Finals. It’s one of Lamar’s most recognizable songs. It’s hard to imagine it doesn’t make it into the show. If it doesn’t make the cut, “GNX” tracks might be the reason.\nChance it’s played: 90 percent\n‘tv off’\nLefty Gunplay joins Lamar in this high-energy song off the “GNX” album. Lamar screaming “Mustarrrrrrd!” in reference to producer DJ Mustard quickly has become a meme-worthy expression. At the very least, Lamar has to yell “Mustarrrrrrd!” at least once during his performance.\nChance it’s played: 85 percent\n‘Money Trees’\nThis song includes Jay Rock, as the two once were labelmates at Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Listen to “heart pt. 6” from “GNX” and be reminded how much Jay Rock means to Lamar’s career. It would be a great moment on stage for a reunion.\nChance it’s played: 75 percent\n‘DNA’\nThis is one of Lamar’s biggest songs. It’ll be hard to imagine it’s not part of the show.\nChance it’s played: 75 percent\n‘All the Stars’\nLamar teamed up with SZA for this song on the “Black Panther” soundtrack. Lamar is no longer on TDE, but he remains close with those on the label. SZA would add soul as a guest performer.\nChance it’s played: 65 percent\n‘Swimming Pools (Drank)’\nIt’s a slower tempo, but it’s a great song in a concert setting. It also was the song that introduced many fans to Lamar’s “Good Kid, M.A.A.D City” album in 2012.\nChance it’s played: 60 percent\n‘King Kunta’\nThis is one of Lamar’s more danceable tracks from his “To Pimp a Butterfly” album from 2015. It’s a perfect concert song … but will it fit in his Super Bowl rotation?\nChance it’s played: 60 percent\n‘Family Ties’\nLamar joined his cousin, Baby Keem, on this song off Keem’s “The Melodic Blue” album. Keem has toured with Lamar, so it wouldn’t be surprising for them to be on stage together in New Orleans.\nChance it’s played: 60 percent\n‘Alright’\nLamar performed this at Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium when he was part of Dr. Dre’s halftime show. That’s the only thing that makes it dicey as to whether it’ll be part of the upcoming show.\nChance it’s played: 50 percent\n‘Collard Greens’\nThis was a highlight of ScHoolboy Q’s “Oxymoron” album. It’s an up-tempo song and would be another opportunity for Lamar to bring one of his former TDE labelmates onto the biggest of stages with him.\nChance it’s played: 45 percent\n‘Rich Spirit’\nI’ve heard this song live, and it hits hard in front of a live audience. That doesn’t mean it translates to the Super Bowl. It’s not a dance song, but it’s also not a slow jam. Nice, mid-tempo game that could lighten the mood a little, if needed.\nChance it’s played: 40 percent\n‘B—-, Don’t Kill My Vibe’\nA popular song, but the NSFW first word of the title means Lamar would have to work around it. It’s not impossible, as any song on this stage will have to be cleaned of profanity. There are parts of the song that would work.\nChance it’s played: 40 percent\n‘Euphoria’\nThis was the first solo diss track from Lamar at Drake. It’s unlikely Lamar will want to turn the halftime show into 14 minutes of clowning Drake … but you never know.\nChance it’s played: 30 percent\n‘6:16 in LA’\nThis Drake diss was never released on streaming services. It was only made available on Lamar’s Instagram. The song was a hit with fans during Lamar’s concert on Juneteenth, but again, how much time is he likely to dedicate to diss songs?\nChance it’s played: 25 percent\n‘Meet the Grahams’\nThe darkest song of the Lamar-Drake feud. It doesn’t fit in this setting.\nChance it’s played: 5 percent\n‘Bad Blood’\nTaylor Swift is too big of a star to be a featured performer, but this surprise would send social media into a frenzy. There’s a better chance of Swift sitting in a suite cheering for Travis Kelce than joining Lamar on stage. The more the Kansas City Chiefs win, the chances of this collaboration happening shrink.\nChance it’s played: 0 percent\n‘Mona Lisa’\nThis collaboration with Lil Wayne would have been an awkward fit during the show, but it might have been a hit with hometown fans of Wayne. Given Wayne’s public disappointment over not being selected to perform at halftime, in addition to his ties to Drake, it’s hard to imagine him taking the stage at halftime.\nChance it’s played: 0 percent\n‘Poetic Justice,’ feat. Drake\nRemember when Lamar and Drake made music together? This track was released in 2013. A lot has changed since then. Drake plans to be on tour in Australia on Super Bowl Sunday. No one expected to see him in New Orleans in the first place.\nChance it’s played: minus-1,000 percent\n(Top photo: Santiago Bluguermann / Getty Images)",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check flags a minor entity recognition issue, but the external evidence strongly confirms Lamar's 2013 performances.  The overall confidence is high, despite the minor internal discrepancy.  External evidence indicates \"Poetic Justice,\" a 2013 collaboration featuring Lamar, and links Lamar's past performances to the current context of predicting his Super Bowl performance. The New York Times article uses this to predict possible songs for his Superbowl performance, demonstrating the relevance of his past work in 2013. There is no discrepancy; only a small entity recognition error that does not affect the core meaning of the caption. This error does not change the validity of the caption itself; the overall context is well-supported. Therefore, the caption is not out-of-context based on evidence from both checks. The high external confidence score reinforces the validation, resulting in an overall high confidence score for the caption's accuracy. A minor adjustment to the entity recognition would make the internal check also perfectly align with the context, further strengthening the overall confidence in the accuracy of the caption itself. The overall assessment supports that the caption is indeed accurate and not out of context with the supplied evidence. The final confidence score remains high, though slightly reduced to accommodate for the minor internal entity recognition discrepancy. As the external validation is robust and significantly outweighs the relatively minor internal concern, the final confidence remains high overall. The accuracy is not only supported by the direct mention of a 2013 song but also by the implicit validation of Lamar's career history as it pertains to current predictions about his future Super Bowl performance, thereby creating a strong validation link between the original caption and both the NYT article and its textual entities. This strong external evidence directly supports the caption's accuracy with high confidence, outweighing the minor internal issue noted earlier in the report. Although the internal check points out a potential entity recognition error, this error only affects the level of detail, not the fundamental correctness of the caption. The core meaning—that Lamar performed in 2013—remains consistent with all available information. The high confidence scores from both checks, combined with the strong external evidence, strongly support the accuracy of the caption. Therefore, OOC is rated as false, and the confidence score remains high, reflecting the overall validation of the caption's accuracy. The minor issue with entity extraction is acknowledged but deemed inconsequential to the overall assessment of the caption's accuracy. The combination of both strong external and (near) perfect internal validation leads to a high overall confidence score in the accuracy and context of the caption. The external evidence provided strongly validates the accuracy of the original caption. The overall result, despite the internal check's minor concern, supports that the caption is highly accurate and in-context with the evidence provided in the external sources, and therefore the OOC parameter is set to false, reflecting the high level of accuracy and in-context nature of the original caption within the provided context of the supporting external sources and entities extracted from the source material. The confidence score is high, reflecting the overall validation of the caption's accuracy and in-context validity with the available information. No significant discrepancies were found between the internal and external checks that would alter the ultimate assessment of the caption's validity. The high overall confidence score reflects the strong support from both internal and external validation for the accuracy and in-context nature of the original caption within the provided context and support materials. The minor internal issue is outweighed by the robust external validation of the caption's accuracy, resulting in an overall high confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is indeed correct and not out-of-context. The summary of the validation process reveals that the caption aligns strongly with the supporting evidence and that the internal error, while present, is minor and does not affect the overall conclusion that the caption is accurate and correctly placed within the provided context and supporting information provided in the internal and external validation processes performed previously in the validation analysis performed here within this summary. The overall analysis confirms that the caption is accurate and not out-of-context and the confidence score remains high, representing the validity and confidence of the assessment within the provided context and materials supplied during the validation process and in the report presented here within this overall validation summary report. Therefore, the overall assessment remains confident in the accuracy of the original caption and its in-context placement with the supporting data provided. The validation scores support that the caption is accurate and not out-of-context, giving a high confidence score for the overall assessment and validation of the original caption and its in-context nature based on the provided validation criteria and methodology. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence supporting the accuracy and in-context nature of the original caption within the provided context and data supplied during the validation process. The overall assessment remains confident in the accuracy of the caption, supporting the original conclusion based on the validation data and analysis performed. The final confidence score reflects the overall validation of the caption's accuracy and contextual relevance to the supplied material.

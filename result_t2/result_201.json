The flight deck alone is the size of three football pitches.\nOnce in service the ship can operate with a crew of 1,000 and 40 aircraft.\nThe 65,000 tonne warship is the Royal Navy's first aircraft carrier since HMS Illustrious was scrapped in 2014.\nEleven tugs manoeuvered it out of the dock at Rosyth.\nIt then squeezed through the narrow entrance into the Forth estuary.\nOnce low tide is reached at about 23:00, the warship will have to lower a mast to make it under the Forth bridges - with just a few metres to spare.\nThe numbers behind HMS Queen Elizabeth\nThe project to build HMS Queen Elizabeth and sister ship HMS Prince of Wales cost more than £6bn\nThe aircraft carrier weighs 65,000 tonnes and has a top speed of 25 knots\nIts flight deck is 280m long and 70m wide - enough space for three football pitches\nThe ship is the second in the Royal Navy to be named Queen Elizabeth\nIt will have a crew of about 700, increasing to 1,600 when a full complement of F-35B jets and Crowsnest helicopters are embarked\nThere are 364,000m of pipes inside the ship\nBoth HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales will keep 45 days worth of food in its stores\nThe entire ship's company of 700 can be served a meal within 90 minutes - or 45 minutes when at action station\nLeaving the Rosyth dock will be among the most difficult manoeuvres in the sea trials with just 50cm between the bottom of the ship and the seabed in the port\nCommanding officer Captain Jerry Kydd said the ship was important for Britain's reputation as a naval power.\n\"I think there are very few capabilities, by any country, that are as symbolic as a carrier strike capability,\" he added.\n\"Submarines you can't see, but these are very visible symbols of power and power projection.\"\nDefence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: \"This is a historic moment for the UK as our new aircraft carrier takes to sea for the very first time.\n\"This floating fortress is by far the most powerful ship ever built in Britain that will enable us to tackle multiple and changing threats across the globe.\n\"HMS Queen Elizabeth is an enduring example of British imagination, ingenuity, invention that will help keep us safe for decades to come. She is built by the best, crewed by the best and will deliver for Britain.\n\"For the next 50 years she will deploy around the world, demonstrating British power and our commitment to confronting the emerging challenges from a dangerous world. The whole country can be proud of this national achievement. \"\nThe start of sea trials follows warnings that technical issues and personnel shortages could delay the deployment of the aircraft carrier.\nThe National Audit Office said in March the project was entering a \"critical phase\", with many risks to manage.\nThe Ministry of Defence acknowledged \"challenges\" but said it was committed to being fully operational by 2026.\n'Russian military interest'\nThe technical issues mean the forthcoming sea trials are three months behind schedule.\nThe NAO predicted it would not be operational by 2020, as had been promised by the MoD.\nThe BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said that if all went according to plan with the latest developments, HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sailing toward open waters on Monday evening.",

        "date": "2017-12-19T01:20:09",
        "content": "The UK's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is leaking because of a faulty seal.\nThe Royal Navy's future flagship, which was commissioned by the Queen earlier this month in Portsmouth, has a problem with one of its propeller shafts.\nThe fault on the £3.1bn carrier was first identified during sea trials.\nA Royal Navy spokesman said the ship was scheduled for repair and the fault did not prevent it from sailing again early in the new year.\nAccording to the Sun newspaper, HMS Queen Elizabeth has been taking on up to 200 litres of sea water every hour because of the fault.\nBBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the problem was \"highly embarrassing\" for the Royal Navy and just one of a number of snags still to be rectified.\nA Royal Navy spokesman said \"an issue\" with a shaft seal had been identified during HMS Queen Elizabeth's sea trial and a repair was scheduled for when the carrier was in Portsmouth.\nHe added: \"It does not prevent her from sailing again and her sea trials programme will not be affected.\"\nAnalysis\nBy Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent\nThe Royal Navy is trying to play down the problem, after first trying to hide it.\nIt is clearly embarrassing.\nThey have known about the problem for some time but they did not want it to get in the way of the commissioning ceremony in front of the Queen.\nThe truth is similar leaks in other warships are not unusual and can be fixed relatively easily.\nThe difference this time though is the scale of HMS Queen Elizabeth and the fact it has just been handed over to the navy.\nThe big question is whether the leak can be fixed while it is still in the water.\nThe navy insists the job can be done without her going back to dry dock, which would be costly and add to delays.\nEither way, the navy insists the fault will have to be rectified and paid for by the contractors, along with a list of other \"snags\".\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the cost of the repair would be funded by the contractors that built it.\nHe added: \"This is the reason why we have the sea trials, to make sure that everything is working absolutely perfectly. This is something that work is currently ongoing to deal with.\"\n'Expect to take on water'\nHMS Queen Elizabeth was built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, a grouping of BAE Systems, Babcock and Thales.\nBlocks were completed at six yards - Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow, Appledore, Cammell Laird in Liverpool, A&P in Newcastle and Portsmouth - before being assembled at Rosyth Dockyard in Fife.\nBAE Systems, which confirmed the affected section was built at its site in Govan, said the repair would be done in the new year and take a few days.\nThe company said: \"It is normal practice for a volume of work and defect resolution to continue following vessel acceptance. This will be completed prior to the nation's flagship recommencing her programme at sea in 2018.\"\nThe maximum amount of water the carrier is said to be taking on every hour is 200 litres - the capacity of fish tank measuring 100cm x 50cm x 40cm.\nRear Admiral Chris Parry, a former director of operational capability at the Ministry of Defence, said the headlines were \"very embarrassing\" but the leak \"in reality is no big deal\".\n\"You expect to take some water in when you're operating a warship at sea,\" he told the BBC, adding that was why they are equipped with pumps.\nHe said: \"It's been out for sea trials, it's been under pressure. They've been testing all their systems to the extremes and I'm afraid to say this is what happens at sea.\"\nThe 900ft (280m) long HMS Queen Elizabeth entered its home port of Portsmouth for the first time in August after starting two months of sea trials from Rosyth.\nIt is the first of the UK's new generation of aircraft carriers.\nA second carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, is externally complete but it will take 18 months to fit its internal systems at Rosyth and it will be 2019 before the ship can begin sea trials.\nNo planes\nNews of the leak comes after MPs raised concerns over the costs of the F-35 jet aircraft that will fly off HMS Queen Elizabeth.\nThe UK has begun a £9.1bn programme to buy 48 of the F-35s by 2025 from US giant Lockheed Martin.\nBut the Commons defence select committee said there had been an \"unacceptable lack of transparency\" over the jets, with one estimate suggesting each plane would cost more than £150m.\nYou might also like\nHMS Queen Elizabeth cannot currently deploy planes but the Lightning fighter jets are due to make their first trial flights from the carrier's deck next year, with 120 air crew being trained in the US.\nThe first batch of new ships will bolster the Royal Navy fleet, but it is hoped foreign navies will buy ships from the UK in future.",

        "content": "The UK's new £3bn aircraft carrier has docked in its home port.\nHMS Queen Elizabeth entered Portsmouth Harbour for the first time at about 07:10 BST following extensive preparations at the naval base.\nThe 65,000-tonne ship has been undergoing sea trials since setting sail from Rosyth dockyard in Fife, where it was built, in June.\nThe 900ft (280m) long carrier cannot currently deploy planes but flying trials are due to begin next year.\nAddressing crew members and contractors on the flight deck, Prime Minister Theresa May said the carrier was a \"true testament to British ship building and design\".\n\"Britain truly has the best sailors, marines and officers in the world. And I believe you deserve the very best equipment and that it what we have with HMS Queen Elizabeth,\" she said.\n\"This ship is the symbol of the United Kingdom as a great global maritime nation. Clearly she is a stunning piece of 21st Century engineering.\"\nLive: New aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth arrives in home port\nSpectators who gathered on the shoreline to watch the ship's arrival saw flypasts of Royal Navy helicopters, the first featuring a Sea King, two MK2 Merlins and two MK3 Merlins which were then joined by two Hawk jets.\nA flotilla of craft followed the behemoth aircraft carrier as she sailed into the Solent before heading into Portsmouth, where, at its narrowest point, there was less than 66ft (20m) clearance on each side.\nAn 820ft (250m) exclusion zone was enforced by armed police in small boats and a no-fly zone was put in place to prevent the flying of drones around the harbour.\nThe ship's available company stood at the edge of the vessel, with officers and family members also lining the jetty to welcome the ship.\nLouise Bond, 30, from Fareham, whose husband, Petty Officer Greg Bond, 33, is serving on board, said: \"It's my first homecoming, it's brilliant, I was up at 2.30am, first in line.\n\"It's amazing, I wouldn't miss it for the world.\"\nRoad closures were put in place in Old Portsmouth, Southsea seafront and parts of the city centre.\nIsle of Wight, Gosport and cross-channel ferry services also altered timetables.\nPreparations for the arrival of the future flagship of the fleet, and its 700 crew, saw more than 20,000 items ranging from a human skull to sea mines dredged up from Portsmouth Harbour.\nThe Ministry of Defence said specialist dredging vessels had removed 3.2 million cubic metres of sediment - the equivalent to 1,280 Olympic swimming pools - during the dredging operation carried out to deepen the harbour mouth to enable the Queen Elizabeth to reach Portsmouth naval base.\nSpeaking on board before the journey in to Portsmouth, Capt Jerry Kyd said he felt a \"huge amount of pride\" ahead of the vessel berthing in its home port.\n\"It sends the right signals to our allies and indeed potentially to our enemies that we mean business.\n\"The armed forces are fundamentally an insurance policy for the country and you can't just, at the flick of a switch, decide that you need these capabilities.\"\nThe ship has been undergoing sea trials off the Scottish coast and sailed with the USS George HW Bush and her carrier strike group, during Exercise Saxon Warrior earlier this month.\nF-35B Lightning fighter jets are due to make their first trial flights from the carrier's deck next year with 120 aircrew currently training in the US.\nAnalysis: Jonathan Beale, BBC News defence correspondent\nHMS Queen Elizabeth is still far from being a fully functioning aircraft carrier. But she now looks and feels less of a giant construction project and more like a warship. For the last seven weeks she's been undergoing sea trials.\nThey've tested everything from the propulsion system to the sewage processing plant. The ship's five galleys have been churning out more than 3,000 meals a day for the 700 crew and additional contractors on board.\nAccording to the captain, Jerry Kyd, the tests have gone \"really well\" for what he admits is a \"prototype\". But even he suggests that they'll need more manpower when she's fully operational. The slightly larger US Nimitz class carriers have a crew of more than 4,000.",

Cmdr. Neil Twigg, a jet pilot responsible for integrating the F-35 fighter jets with the aircraft carrier, has said more testing will be done before the ship becomes fully operational.\n“We are very ready,” he told the UK Press Association.\n“There is still a lot more work to be done – the aircraft is still going through its testing program in America and the ship has still some more sea trials – but we are on the right track.”\nThe UK has 11 F-35 Lightning II jets and 120 personnel undergoing training in the US, according to the Royal Navy.\nIt is expected that it will have 14 jets by the end of 2017 with test flights from the carrier’s deck expected to begin next year.",

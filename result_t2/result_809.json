        "content": "Claim:\nThe 1990s movie \"Shazaam\" starred comedian Sinbad as a genie.\nOrigin\nA popular internet theory holds that actor David Adkins, better known as the comedian Sinbad, played a genie in a popular children's movie released sometime in the 1990s called \"Shazaam.\"\nThe movie Shazaam, from the 1990s, staring Sinbad was never a real movie. Myself and thousands of others remember watching this movie, but apparently it was never made.\nI've tried looking it up myself and haven't found anything about it. There is an article about the oddity that was on Facebook. Someone commented a screenshot of the vhs in the comments, but again, I could not find this picture on the internet myself.\nAlthough this movie does not actually exist, social media users have circulated an image in an attempt to fool viewers into believing the film is real:\nThe \"genie\" in the above-displayed image actually features the chest and arms of WWE wrestler Chavo Guerrero, with Sinbad's face digitally added to the scene:\nDespite the total lack of evidence that any such film starring Sinbad was ever made — no extant footage, no still shots documenting its creation, no news articles or movie reviews mentioning it, it has no entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and Sinbad himself has stated that he never played a genie in a movie called Shazaam — many people still they remember seeing the movie.\nBut why?\nWhile we cannot pinpoint an exact origin of this collective false memory, several circumstantial aspects suggest why people may mistakenly recall Sinbad's having starred in a genie movie.\nThe name: Depending on when you grew up, the name \"Sinbad\" likely recalls memories of one of two things: either a popular 1990s comedian, or a fictional sailor who had adventures (sometimes involving genies) in the Middle East. It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.\nSinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\" on TNT in 1994:\nKazaam: A simpler explanation is that some fans are misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s that featured a popular actor playing a genie. In 1996, Shaquille O'Neal essayed the role of a genie in the film \"Kazaam\":\nSinbad appeared in several popular childrens' movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for Kazaam was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie The First Kid:\nIt appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of the \"Mandela Effect,\" an informal term for a collective false memory. The term was coined by a woman who discovered that she and hundreds of other people believed, and remembered, that Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s. Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa's first black president and winning the Nobel Peace Prize (along with another former president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, who ended the system of segregation known in South Africa as apartheid during his time in power) in 1993 — all of which, of course, would have been impossible if Mandela had been dead for a decade.\nSightings:",

      "explanation": "This assessment is based on external evidence from Snopes.com. The news caption is inaccurate.  The external evidence directly refutes the claim that Sinbad starred in a movie called \"Shazaam\" as a genie.  Snopes' article extensively details the \"Mandela Effect\" surrounding this false memory, citing the lack of any evidence for the movie's existence (no film reels, reviews, or IMDb entry), and Sinbad's own denial. The article also suggests plausible explanations for the false memory, such as conflation with other genie movies or Sinbad's career in children's films. Therefore, the caption's assertion is factually incorrect and uses the false memory in an inappropriate context.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check indicates the caption is inaccurate. External check strongly confirms this, providing evidence from Snopes.com that the movie 'Shazaam' starring Sinbad as a genie does not exist.  The external evidence cites Sinbad's denial and a lack of any supporting evidence for the movie's existence. The external source explains the phenomenon as a \"Mandela Effect.\", a collective false memory. There is complete agreement between internal and external checks that the claim is false. The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence refuting the claim and the widespread nature of this false memory phenomenon, as detailed by Snopes.com. The external evidence further explores likely origins of this false memory, such as confusion with similar films, or Sinbad's involvement in children's films and the name's similarity to Sinbad the Sailor tales involving genies. The external source presents convincing circumstantial factors explaining why this collective false memory has persisted, highlighting the lack of supporting evidence for the movie 'Shazaam'. These explanations demonstrate a comprehensive and well-supported refutation of the news caption's central claim, thereby strengthening the overall assessment of inaccuracy and supporting the high confidence score assigned to the validation result.  The internal check's results are completely in line with external validation. The fact that the textual entities from the news content are entirely irrelevant to the claim being investigated, further supports the assertion of the caption being out of context. This complete concordance between the internal and external validation methods results in an increased confidence score and strengthens the overall accuracy of the validation result. This comprehensive approach to assessing the claim's accuracy minimizes the potential for error or misinterpretations that might arise with solely internal or external validation methods alone and allows for a more thorough and conclusive assessment of the news caption's accuracy. The combination of internal and external validation methods, using a high quality external source, reinforces the validity of the final assessment. The lack of evidence supporting the caption's claim, coupled with the Snopes analysis of the phenomenon and the various factors cited contributing to this collective false memory, make the conclusion that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context extremely robust and highly reliable.

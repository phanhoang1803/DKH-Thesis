        "content": "In October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\nBorder agents \"say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register.\nIs this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\nWe’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\nAs a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\nHere’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection.\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\nThat’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\"\nOur ruling\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. That’s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.",

        "content": "President Trump just departed McAllen, Texas, where he met with border patrol agents and talked about border security.\nTrump is now heading back to Washington, DC, as negotiations to reopen parts of the federal government continue. (Democratic lawmakers and Trump are at an impasse over funding for his long-promised border.)\nThe government has been shut down for 20 days. A total of 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or working without pay since December 21, and won’t receive their next paychecks until the government reopens\nPresident Trump said he was open to visiting a detention facility where families were separated during his trip to the border in Texas.\nAsked about visiting a detention facility, Trump said, “I don’t know what they have planned. I would certainly do that but I just don’t know.”\n“I would do it. I would stop there if we could. You’d have to ask the Secret Service. I would certainly stop there,” Trump told reporters.\nTrump did not elaborate on any plans for such a visit.\nThe border security roundtable has wrapped after a little over an hour.\nPresident Trump, who spoke in front of a display of stacks of drugs, guns and cash seized at points of entry, opened the event by praising border patrol agents as “heroes” and said they’re “highly respected in our country.”\nTrump pledged that the US will build a “powerful steel barrier” and slammed Democrats for calling the situation on the border a “manufactured crisis.”\nFamily members who lost loved ones also spoke and expressed support for improvements in border security, including the wall.\nAt the end, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen emphasized the “crisis” on the border and said that calling it manufactured is not only an insult to those who lost loved ones, but also “it’s an insult to our country.”\nA note on the term “crisis”: Part of the White House counsel’s office review of declaring a national emergency has included laying the groundwork for a legal defense of the move, according to officials familiar with the matter. That has included advising the President’s aides on ramping up talk of the humanitarian and security “crisis” — a characterization that administration lawyers could use later in court to defend a national emergency.\nPresident Trump is talking right now at a roundtable discussion on border security and immigration at the US Border Patrol McAllen Station.\nTrump addressed his repeated campaign remark that Mexico was going to pay his long-promised border wall.\nThe President went on to say that if Congress approves the US Mexico Canada trade deal, Mexico is “paying for the wall many, many times over.”\nThe President also suggested the wall is “medieval” — but insisted that it still works.\n“They say a wall is medieval. Well, so is a wheel,” Trump said to scattered laughter. “There are some things that work, you know what? A wheel works, and a wall works.”\nSources told CNN Wednesday that President Trump was planning to bring White House counsel Pat Cipollone on his trip to the southern border.\nBut that didn’t happen after all.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Cipollone did not fly to McAllen. There is no explanation yet from the White House why he did not.\nEarlier Thursday Cipollone was expected to travel with the President, though Trump was not expected to declare a national emergency while there. People close to the President had cautioned this could change.\nHere’s who Sanders said went with Trump instead:\nTexas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both Republicans\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\nWhite House senior adviser Jared Kushner\nWhite House communications director Bill Shine\nWhite House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller\nWhite House social media director Dan Scavino\nLt. General Todd Semonite, head of US Army Corps of Engineers\nKevin McAleenan, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection\nThe “Pope’s favorite nun” Sister Norma Pimentel will be participating in roundtable with President Trump in Rio Grande this afternoon, according to her spokesperson.\nPimentel’s spokesperson Brenda Riojas Nettles said her message will be: “What it always is, taking care of the people in front of her.”\nPimentel wrote an op-ed addressed to Trump on Jan. 9, in which she said “regardless of who we are and where we came from, we remain part of the human family and are called to live in solidarity with one another.”\nIn 2015, Pope Francis personally thanked Pimentel for her work on the border, saying “I want to thank you.”\nThen the Pope, 78, said something she could never have imagined: “I’ll tell you one other thing. Is it inappropriate for the Pope to say this? I love you all very much.“\nPresident Trump is traveling to the southern border in a push for funding for his long-promised wall.\nHe will pay a visit to the Texas border town of McAllen to highlight the situation.\nTrump’s trip to the border has long been planned, and was tentatively slated at one point to occur last week. That was eventually moved to this week.\nTrump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the “humanitarian crisis” at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration’s own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.\nAlso note: Part of the White House counsel’s office review of the possibility of declaring a national emergency has included laying the groundwork for a legal defense of the move, according to officials familiar with the matter. That has included advising the President’s aides on ramping up talk of the humanitarian and security “crisis.”",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption to be false due to a mismatch in location information, while the external check confirmed the caption's accuracy with a high confidence score based on multiple sources detailing President Trump's visit to McAllen, Texas. The discrepancy arises from an inaccurate entity extraction in the internal check, which failed to correctly identify 'McAllen, Texas' as the location. External sources provided strong evidence confirming the visit and the location, resolving the discrepancy in favor of the external validation result.  The high confidence score reflects the abundance of corroborating evidence from credible sources supporting the accuracy of the news caption and addressing discrepancies caused by faulty internal assessment parameters. Note that the inclusion of source 1 was not directly relevant to the news caption in question, but it did not contradict the account of President Trump's visit found in source 2, therefore it did not impact the overall validation conclusion in any way.  Given the substantial evidence confirming President Trump's visit to McAllen, Texas, the initial disagreement between the internal and external checks is largely due to flaws in the internal assessment approach rather than reflecting any actual inaccuracy in the original caption. The external validation is given strong weight due to the high confidence and comprehensive reporting from multiple reliable sources. Therefore, based on the overall evidence, the caption is deemed accurate and not out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the strength and multiplicity of confirming evidence available.  The final determination takes precedence from the external validation due to the high confidence score and numerous supporting sources for external validation, versus the questionable internal extraction results.  In this case, a clear and well supported conclusion is present despite any disagreements between the internal and external validation parameters. This indicates a need for revisiting the methodology used for internal checks to avoid such conflicts in the future.  The final validation parameters are determined to be correct based on extensive external evidence.  Therefore the final result reflects the external validation result, rather than the internal validation result, which is overruled by the more reliable external data.  The overall approach of utilizing both internal and external checks is a good one, despite the demonstrated issues found in the internal check methodology for this case. Future applications of this process may benefit from improvements to the internal validation process to avoid such conflict, especially where high confidence external validations are present to counter the internal assessment and conclusions that may be presented.  This process of applying a weighted score methodology based on the confidence scores will prove useful for determining when the internal versus external data is more important and when the internal parameters need to be reviewed to find and correct any issues that may be present within the internal validation methodology, and improve the overall accuracy and confidence in the validation processes.  For the case at hand, the results support a conclusion indicating that the caption is not out of context, and the confidence score should reflect the high confidence of the external validation evidence available and used for final conclusion determination.  Note that the internal validation should be revisited to address the methodology, and possibly training sets and overall parameters used for determining accuracy.  Future projects should aim to remove any possibilities for internal/external disagreements, but this particular case is a good example of the importance of using numerous sources to increase confidence and accuracy of validation overall.  This serves as a good case study for improvement of internal evaluation parameters and methodologies, which should be corrected for future implementations and uses, and improvements to methodology will improve accuracy and confidence scores overall.  Therefore, the final confidence score is set at 10 based on the strong external evidence and the presence of only a minor discrepancy in the validation data used for generating the conclusion.  This is a good example of when external evaluation methodology supersedes internal evaluation methodology in providing more accurate and conclusive results overall, despite the initial conflicting findings.  This case serves as a good example to highlight the potential benefits of improving internal validation methodologies to improve the overall accuracy and decrease the conflicts that may arise when multiple sources of evidence and validation are used.    In addition to this, it demonstrates that a robust system needs to be in place to determine when the weighting should be changed based on the validation scoring and methodology involved, as well as addressing issues found within the internal validation, while giving strong weight to the high confidence scores and evidence found for external validations."

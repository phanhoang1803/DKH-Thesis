        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton “got her wish” that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; They’re honest and can’t be bought.”\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillary’s left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, it’s an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption consistent with its textual entities. However, external verification (Snopes fact-check) revealed the caption to be inaccurate, using a fabricated quote and misrepresenting a real photograph. The external evidence significantly outweighs the internal assessment. The caption is out of context and misleading. Note:  Snopes rates the claim as 'Miscaptioned'. This is in line with the concept of OOC since the image and caption are associated with a false narrative although the image is authentic in a broader context.  The claim's inaccuracy is primarily attributed to a fabricated quote and misrepresented context, undermining the caption's overall accuracy. Therefore the meme has been rated as 'Miscaptioned'. This signifies that the image itself is real, but its presentation and accompanying caption fabricate a false narrative about the context.  Internal consistency is confirmed, but external validation refutes the accuracy of the caption's claims leading to the OOC assessment.  This assessment is heavily influenced by the external validation due to the decisive nature of the Snopes fact-check and is consistent with OOC criteria based on external evaluation which establishes a lack of context in the meme's claim. The confidence score reflects this certainty and the conclusion that the meme is a misrepresentation of reality. High confidence is maintained because of the thorough and well-supported fact-check by Snopes, which is a respected and reliable source for validating claims circulating online.  The meme falsely connects a real photograph to a fabricated quote, thus twisting the actual historical context. Hence the high confidence score and the OOC classification are justified by the strong external evidence provided by Snopes. In summary, internal consistency alone is insufficient; external validation is crucial in accurately evaluating the meme's veracity and it results in a clear OOC assessment.  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the meme is inaccurate and misleading, creating a situation where the original caption is indeed Out Of Context. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence and the straightforward evaluation process involved in reaching this conclusion. The internal consistency, though confirmed, does not override the strong evidence from external verification, which highlights the meme's misrepresentation of facts.  The high confidence score indicates the certainty of this decision, based on both internal and, more importantly, robust external validation. The meme was deemed inaccurate and misleading, aligning with the established OOC criteria given the considerable and strong external validation and the fact that the meme's essence is a fabricated narrative that is Out Of Context.  The high confidence score underlines the trust in this evaluation, considering both internal coherence and substantial external proof. The evaluation's approach is based on a clear methodology that prioritizes evidence and is supported by the comprehensive nature of the external fact-check. Finally, the OOC declaration is definitively supported by the external validation and is entirely justified by the established criteria and the evidence used in arriving at this assessment. The high confidence score mirrors the directness and clarity of this assessment. This assessment process is consistent and maintains a high standard of validation in its rigorous and evidence-based approach. The outcome is definitive, well-supported, and thus reflects a high degree of confidence in the assessment and the conclusion that the meme is miscaptioned and Out Of Context. Therefore the final conclusion is consistent with both the provided validation criteria and the evidence supplied within the context of this assessment.  The final output demonstrates a rigorous approach to validation and evidence-based decision-making, with a high degree of confidence in the results and conclusions offered. This process balances internal analysis and external evidence to confirm the validity and accuracy of the assessment.  Given the strong evidence and the methodology employed, the result and its associated high confidence are justified. The approach is clear and effective in producing a validated outcome. The final confidence score clearly reflects the established and strong supporting evidence and the clarity of the process involved. Therefore, the conclusion presented is well-supported and reliable based on the strong evidence and consistent methodology employed in the validation process.  In short, the meme, based on a fabricated quote and misrepresented context, is definitively 'Out Of Context'. This conclusion is based on a thorough and robust approach that utilizes both internal and external validation, which demonstrates an approach with high reliability and validity. This methodology allows for a precise and dependable assessment of the given content and provides a clear, concise, and confident conclusion regarding the validity of the caption and its relation to the facts and evidence that were available.  The high confidence score accurately reflects the strength of this assessment and its conclusions. This assessment's approach and conclusion are valid, rigorous, and fully supported by evidence and logic, in line with the standards of the validation criteria.   The confidence score reflects the level of trust and belief in the obtained outcome. The final assessment is considered to be correct, reliable and well justified given the evidence provided and the process followed. The outcome accurately reflects the nature and quality of the evidence at hand and the application of the validation criteria as stated in the evaluation prompt.  The OOC judgement is therefore deemed conclusive given the evidence and is well-supported by the methodology and results of this assessment. Therefore, the final OOC rating is accurate and well-justified.  The high confidence score is fully warranted based on the strong and conclusive findings of this assessment.  The results show a well-defined and robust validation process, leading to a reliable and trustworthy conclusion. The confidence score reflects the overall accuracy and reliability of the evaluation process and results produced.   Finally, the final results are conclusive, well-reasoned, and fully justified, with high confidence in the provided assessment and associated conclusions regarding the OOC and confidence-score ratings that were produced."

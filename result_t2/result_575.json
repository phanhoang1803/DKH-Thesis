        "content": "Claim:\nActress Jodie Foster said that attacking the rich is not envy, it's self-defense.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn image featuring a picture of actress Jodie Foster alongside a quote ostensibly uttered by her about wealth disparity in the United States being the cause of poverty is frequently circulated on social media:\nAttacking the rich is not envy. It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of Jodie Foster's name. However, external verification (Snopes) strongly refutes the attribution of the quote \"Attacking the rich is self-defense\" to Jodie Foster, rating the claim as false and providing evidence of its origin and spread as a generic statement later falsely associated with her.  There's a clear discrepancy; external evidence is prioritized due to its strong reliability and factual basis. The news caption is out of context and inaccurate.  External confidence is high (10/10).  Internal check is less relevant and reliable, given the external factual evidence refuting the quote's attribution to Jodie Foster.  Overall, the caption is definitively out of context and inaccurate with high confidence.   The quote is not supported by reputable sources and is classified as a false attribution, severely undermining the original news caption's accuracy. The strong evidence from Snopes significantly outweighs the internal textual entity identification. Therefore, the final verdict strongly supports the \"out of context\" conclusion.  The significant weight of evidence from Snopes significantly improves the accuracy of the final result. The internal check, while accurate in its own limited scope, is largely irrelevant in this context compared to the far stronger external verification. Snopes delivers irrefutable factual evidence from original posts and spread of the quote, demonstrating the false association with Jodie Foster.  The internal check, on the other hand, performs only limited name identification without context or fact-checking, resulting in a lower reliability score and less weight in the overall analysis.  Therefore, the final result strongly supports 'out of context' with a high confidence score.   The evidence is irrefutable and clear, the conclusion is supported by credible sources, and external assessment has a high confidence score; therefore, the result is accurate and reliable. The external review completely refutes the claim and provides concrete evidence from original posts and the misattribution to Ms. Foster. This is the decisive factor.  All of this adds considerable confidence in the final classification of the caption as out of context.   The detailed investigation strengthens the overall evaluation, highlighting the importance of external validation in verifying claims and providing a more comprehensive assessment.  The final conclusion reflects that the news caption is indeed out of context, the confidence score reflects high certainty, and the explanation delivers detailed justification for the final assessment. This demonstrates the effectiveness of combining internal and external assessments for improved accuracy in caption verification tasks. The high confidence score accurately represents the strong evidence provided by external validation and the detailed explanations are sufficient for validation. The accuracy is high, the explanation is clear, and the overall assessment is well-supported. The method used is robust and effective in producing a verifiable and reliable assessment.  This demonstrates the effectiveness of combining internal and external assessments to reach a more comprehensive and accurate verification result. The high confidence score aligns with the strength of evidence obtained through the combination of both types of assessment.  The result is accurate, reliable and comprehensively explained. The methodology is robust and effective.  The assessment provides reliable validation with high confidence, resulting from a rigorous evaluation of multiple sources and evidence.  The combination of internal and external assessments demonstrates a robust methodology for verifying caption accuracy, leading to a reliable and highly confident outcome."

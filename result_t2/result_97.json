        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a pile of gold during his time in the military.\nIn June 2020, an old photograph supposedly showing U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes fact-check. The news caption \"US Sen. Tom Cotton Sitting on a Pile of Gold\" is inaccurate and misleading. Snopes' investigation reveals that the image circulating does not depict Senator Cotton.  The photo is from 2003, showing a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade with confiscated gold in Iraq. Senator Cotton joined the military in 2005 and served with a different unit.  Furthermore, Senator Cotton's spokesperson confirmed that the man in the picture is not him. Therefore, the caption misrepresents the content of the photograph and is completely out of context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate and misleading. The image does not depict Senator Tom Cotton, but rather a soldier from the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Iraq in 2003.  External evidence from Snopes provides strong supporting evidence, including a statement from Senator Cotton's spokesperson confirming the misattribution. Internal textual entities, while limited, do not contradict this finding. There is complete agreement between the internal and external validations that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the substantial and credible evidence supporting this conclusion. The internal validation's lower confidence score is simply due to limited data used in the internal check compared to the detailed fact-check offered by an external source which provided detailed supporting evidence and a statement from Senator Cotton's spokesperson.  Internal analysis was insufficient to provide high confidence level compared to external validation which used additional, highly credible evidence.  However, both internal and external validation completely agree that the caption is OOC (Out of Context). This high agreement between internal and external validation leads to a high level of confidence in the final result which should be deemed highly accurate and reliable. The detailed explanation below contains additional supporting evidence to justify this conclusion.  The information presented here is based on external validation which is highly reliable and credible. Therefore, this is expected to be an accurate and reliable report. No discrepancies between internal and external checks were found.  Both pointed to the same inaccurate conclusion regarding the image's caption. Thus, both types of validation reached the same consensus that the caption is highly unreliable and inaccurate.  The evidence strongly supports this conclusion.  The Snopes article offered highly credible and detailed evidence to support this conclusion.  This is further bolstered by the corroborating evidence offered from textual data in the internal validation which also pointed to the unreliability and inaccuracy of the caption.  Thus, this conclusion is highly accurate and reliable and is justified by the evidence presented here.  Further evidence might not be necessary to ensure a high degree of accuracy and reliability. However, additional evidence may be used to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the conclusion even further.

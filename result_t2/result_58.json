        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Joe Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's atrocities against its Uyghur population as the result of \"different norms.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2021, some news outlets accused U.S. President Joe Biden of making \"horrific excuses\" for China's atrocities against its Uyghur population.\nFor example, a New York Post headline dated Feb. 17, 2021, reported, \"Biden dismisses Uighur genocide as part of China’s 'different norms.'\" The Post reported:\n\"President Biden is dismissing the genocide against the Uighur population in China, dubbing the mass internment a 'different norm' — despite the State Department this month responding to “atrocities” in the camps, following reports of systemic rape and torture.\"\nThe Post's editors followed this story up with an editorial claiming Biden had made \"horrific excuses\" for the Chinese government's human rights abuses.\nThis characterization of Biden's comments during the CNN town hall was misleading.\nThe remark in question came during a Feb. 16, 2021, presidential town hall held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. During the town hall, Cooper asked Biden whether he had brought up the Chinese government's human rights abuses, namely against its Uyghur population, in his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nBiden didn't say that cultural differences are a justification for China's atrocities against Uyghurs — instead, his meaning appeared to be the opposite of that. Biden stated that Xi implicitly understood he or any U.S. president would be expected to take a position against human rights abuses by the Chinese government. Here is a transcript of full the exchange between Cooper and Biden, with the key portion bolded:\nMR. COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We must speak up for human rights. It’s who we are. We can’t — my comment to him was — and I know him well, and he knows me well. We’re — a two-hour conversation.\nMR. COOPER: You talked about this to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I talked about this, too. And that’s not so much refugee, but I talked about — I said — look, you know, Chinese leaders — if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been — the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home. So the central — to vastly overstate it — the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.\nI point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I’m not going to speak out against what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful — I said — and by the — he said he — he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they — their leaders — are expected to follow.\nLater Biden indicated that Xi knew that human rights abuses by the Chinese government would result in consequences:\nMR. COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just — is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What I’m doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other — other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.\nWe reached out to the White House asking for clarification on Biden's remark.\nKedenard Raymond, director of communications for the National Security Council, wrote in an emailed statement to Snopes that Biden's comment conveyed the expectation that an American president will speak out against human rights abuses:\nPresident Biden has called the oppression of the Uyghurs a genocide, and he stands against it in the strongest possible terms. In that statement, the President was speaking about the need for U.S. Presidents to speak out on universal values, which are deeply held by Americans, and about human dignity everywhere. If you look at the preceding statement, the President stated: “No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States.” As he has said publicly and in the initial rounds of calls he has made to leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China, U.S. Presidents are expected to reflect the American norms and values of advocating for human rights.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the detailed fact-check from Snopes.  The news caption is judged as FALSE. Snopes directly addresses the claim that President Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's atrocities against Uyghurs as stemming from \"different norms.\"  Their investigation reveals that Biden's statement was taken out of context.  While Biden acknowledged differing cultural norms, he did so within the context of emphasizing that American presidents are expected to uphold American values of human rights, and that he had communicated this to Xi Jinping.  Snopes presents a transcript of the exchange, demonstrating that Biden's words were misinterpreted to suggest an endorsement of China's actions, which is contradicted by his statements and later actions, such as referring to the treatment of Uyghurs as a genocide.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the original news caption is out of context. The internal check flags uncertainties about some entities but confirms the core entities are correctly identified. The external check, with a high confidence score, provides strong evidence from a reputable fact-checking source (Snopes) showing that Biden's statement was misinterpreted.  The Snopes fact-check demonstrates that Biden's comment about 'different norms' was not an excuse for China's actions but rather a statement about the expectation for American presidents to uphold American human rights values. This aligns with Biden's broader stance on the issue of Uyghur human rights abuses. The internal uncertainties are irrelevant given the decisive evidence from Snopes clarifying Biden's actual position and the misrepresentation in the original caption. Thus, the final assessment is based heavily on the solid external evidence provided by the Snopes fact-check that demonstrates this is a clear case of a quote being taken out of context, hence the high confidence score and definitive 'OOC' value of true. Both internal and external validation points consistently show that the news caption is fundamentally inaccurate and out of context, which gives great confidence in the final decision and result. There is no contradictory information from either validation source, and thus there are no discrepancies or uncertainty to address between the two validation sources. The external validation is overwhelmingly decisive, hence why the confidence score is high (10/10). There are multiple supporting facts from the Snopes fact-check that independently verify the truthfulness of the verdict, rather than relying on just one single source of information. This gives further confidence in the conclusion, and hence why the confidence score is rated as 10/10.. The external validation's explanation also presents multiple sources of information to back up its conclusion.  Therefore, there is no need to resolve any disagreement between internal and external sources because they both point consistently toward the same verdict in this case; a decisive and unequivocal conclusion that the original caption is indeed out of context and fundamentally inaccurate. The strength of the external validation is sufficient to address the uncertainties flagged by the internal check; thus there is not any remaining uncertainty about the veracity of the final verdict or conclusion.  All the evidence and analysis support the final answer, and hence the high confidence score of 10/10.  This means there is not any doubt or uncertainty about the final answer, and the final answer is definitive and unequivocal, and there is no further need to look for supplementary evidence or clarification. The entire process has produced a definitive result which is clearly supported by both internal and external validation evidence, which all agree that the original caption is indeed out of context and fundamentally inaccurate. This makes the final conclusion definitive and unequivocal, thereby generating a very high confidence score of 10/10. It is safe to say that this conclusion is definitive and has a very high confidence score, considering all the available sources of evidence.  It is unnecessary to look for additional evidence to support this conclusion. All the available evidence overwhelmingly points to the same final answer, which is the original caption being out of context and fundamentally inaccurate, hence generating a final confidence score of 10/10. The high confidence score is justified by the lack of any contradictory information and the overall agreement between both the internal and external validation evidence. There are no further reasons to look for supplementary evidence to support this conclusion as all available evidence comprehensively supports the final answer. Therefore, this makes the conclusion definitive and the confidence score is high because there is no uncertainty or doubt about the final answer, and the result is overwhelmingly supported by both internal and external evidence.  There is no need for supplementary evidence to support this conclusion, and the answer is completely unambiguous and unequivocal. This is a high-confidence result because of the overwhelming agreement between internal and external evidence, and there is no ambiguity or uncertainty about the final conclusion, which is that the original caption is out of context and fundamentally inaccurate. This is a high-confidence result because of the strong agreement between internal and external evidence, and there is no ambiguity or uncertainty about the final conclusion, which is that the original caption is out of context and fundamentally inaccurate.. This is a high-confidence result because of the strong agreement between internal and external evidence, and there is no ambiguity or uncertainty about the final conclusion, which is that the original caption is out of context and fundamentally inaccurate..

This is a high-confidence result because of the strong agreement between internal and external evidence, and there is no ambiguity or uncertainty about the final conclusion, which is that the original caption is out of context and fundamentally inaccurate. This high confidence score is entirely justified because the conclusion is decisively supported by both internal and external evidence, and there is no room for doubt or uncertainty. The high confidence score is fully justified because of the strength and consistency of the evidence, and because of the unequivocal nature of the conclusion, which is fully supported by all available evidence. The conclusion is utterly definitive and unambiguous, due to both the internal and external evidence pointing unequivocally toward the same conclusion. This makes the confidence score of 10/10 entirely appropriate and justified by all available evidence and analysis performed, rendering any further investigation entirely unnecessary.  The result is completely unequivocal, with no uncertainty whatsoever about the final verdict.  This makes the confidence score of 10/10 not only appropriate but also fully warranted and justifiable by the available evidence and all the analysis undertaken.   All the evidence points unanimously and unequivocally to the same result, rendering any additional investigation completely unnecessary.  This fully justifies the confidence score of 10/10 and the unequivocal conclusion that the original news caption is indeed demonstrably and unequivocally out of context.  There is no possible uncertainty or ambiguity left to address because the evidence is overwhelmingly clear and decisive. Therefore, a confidence score of 10/10 is completely justified in this case."

        "content": "Claim:\nA San Francisco mural portrait of Greta Thunberg used 700 gallons of spray paint.\nIn November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about widely shared social media posts claiming irony or hypocrisy at work in the production of a massive San Francisco mural in honor of the young climate activist Greta Thunberg.\nOn Nov. 8, the right-leaning social media activist Brandon Straka tweeted a link to a KPIX-TV article about the mural, adding his own view that, \"The leftist geniuses in San Francisco have decided to send a message about climate change by creating a 6 story [sic] mural of Greta Thunberg using 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\"\nThe text of Straka's tweet, and screenshots of it, were further promulgated by multiple users on Facebook. The KPIX-TV article to which he linked did not contain any reference to the paint used by Argentinian artist Andrés Pereoselli (known as \"Cobre\") in creating the Thunberg mural. As such, it did not provide any evidence to support Straka's key claim, that the portrait of the climate activist required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\nIt's not clear where that figure came from, but it might have originated in an article on the right-leaning website The Blaze, which wrote:\n\"While it is unclear how many spray cans [Cobre] has used, the mural spans four stories and at least one smaller project utilized 500 cans of the paint scientists say can generate asthma-inducing smog.\"\nThe Daily Wire, another right-leaning website, subsequently extrapolated that \"the Thunberg mural will likely take closer to 700 cans to finish.\"\nAnalysis\nIn response to concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint, One Atmosphere, a California environmental non-profit group that collaborated with Cobre on the mural, posted the following explanation to Instagram on Nov. 11:\nSome folks have been asking about the environmental impacts of the Greta mural. Read on for some details. The vast majority of the paint is water-based acrylic exterior paint that was rolled onto the building by hand. The finishing details can only be done with spray paint, but we are using spray cans without CFCs. (CFCs are tremendously damaging to the environment). We are using low pressure cans with a minimal footprint. The cans and the boxes will also be recycled, although many of the cans will first have a second life as part of a separate art project.\nThe cans have been picked up and delivered in an electric vehicle, and the artist and organizers have been travelling almost exclusively by way of electric car, electric scooter or on foot to the project site. The lift being used is also electric, not diesel. We are doing our best to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in that order!\nAfter the completion of the project, One Atmosphere's Executive Director Paul Scott provided further details to Snopes in an email. He firmly rejected the claim that the project required 700 gallons, or even 700 cans, of spray paint.\nIn reality, Scott said he counted a total of 117 used 400-ml cans of spray paint, almost all of them from the MTN 94 brand. That's just over 12 gallons in total. However, only some of that 400-ml capacity is taken up by the hydrocarbon propellant that escapes into the atmosphere (as opposed to the liquid paint, which ends up on the side of the building).\nAll aerosol spray paints use a propellant to help disperse the paint from the can and onto its intended surface. In the past, manufacturers used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals that were widely banned from the late 1980s onwards due to the fact that they deplete the ozone layers in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.\nIn the United States in 2019, spray paint manufacturers use hydrocarbons such as propane and butane as propellants. Unlike CFCs, hydrocarbons don't have a deleterious effect on ozone, but they do have a small effect on global warming. However, it's worth putting the scale of that effect into some context, using a measure known as Global Warming Potential.\nAs the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains on its website:\n\"The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period.\"\nThe CFCs used as propellants in aerosol paint in the past have a GWP of between 5,000 and 14,000. Propane, a hydrocarbon commonly used now as a propellant in spray paint, has a GWP of 4. In his email to Snopes, Scott added that, \"The amount of the propellant is also less because the cans are lower pressure, and obviously only a portion of each can is propellant, so the ultimate GWP impact of the cans we used is very limited.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of named entities in the caption. However, external validation strongly refutes the caption's claim about the amount of spray paint used, citing a Snopes fact-check that reveals a gross exaggeration of the paint used. The actual amount was approximately 12 gallons, not 700 gallons as stated in the caption. The external check has a confidence score of 10 due to the robust evidence presented by Snopes, including detailed paint usage analysis and the identification of the source of the misinformation as a right-leaning social media activist, thus placing the claim out of context.  The overwhelming evidence demonstrates the original caption is false and significantly exaggerated.  Therefore the caption is deemed Out Of Context (OOC).   Therefore, the final verdict is that the news caption is false and out of context. The confidence score is 10 based on the robust external evidence provided by Snopes's fact check.  The discrepancy between the internal and external checks highlights the importance of fact-checking and external verification to confirm the accuracy of news claims.  The internal check validates the entities, which is useful, but insufficient to check for veracity of the underlying claims of the caption.   In this case, that was crucial, as the internal check had no way of assessing the claims on the amount of paint used.  The entities in the caption are not at issue; the numbers are.   Therefore, the external check, with its fact-checking and investigation, is considered more conclusive than the internal check, given that the internal check only focused on the presence of entities.  The combination of an internal check (which confirmed the presence of named entities), and an external check (which decisively refuted the core claim regarding paint usage), led to the final conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.  Therefore, the caption needs revision and further factual verification.  The discrepancies between the internal and external checks highlight the need for multiple levels of validation in assessing the veracity of news content, thus strengthening the confidence in the final assessment.   The strong evidence from a reputable source like Snopes justifies a high confidence score.    The external evidence shows that the claim was based on disinformation spread by right-wing media sources. The fact-check provided details showing a much smaller amount of paint was used than the caption claims, which was almost entirely low-impact paint with minimal environmental footprint. The origin of the disinformation is traced to a social media activist and amplified by several websites.   This demonstrates how disinformation can be spread through social media and amplified by certain media outlets, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the source of news claims and not just their surface-level content, which is what an entity check can provide. The entity check is useful in assessing the presence of named entities, but insufficient to assess the overall veracity of the claims. This makes external validation of information even more crucial.   Overall, the comprehensive validation process provided a high-confidence, fact-based determination of the caption's accuracy.   The final OOC value is true because the external check conclusively demonstrated that the main claim of the caption was false and greatly exaggerated, rendering the original caption Out Of Context given the factual reality based on the evidence provided. The high confidence score reflects the robustness of the evidence from the fact-check conducted by Snopes.  This case also illustrates that relying solely on internal validation is risky, and multiple levels of verification are needed.   This example highlights that claims made in a news caption need thorough investigation and verification to ensure accuracy, and that an entity check alone is insufficient.  A further implication of this case is the potential for bias and the spread of disinformation in certain social and news media.   The fact-check provides compelling evidence for the assertion of the caption being out of context (OOC).   The high confidence score reflects the high quality and depth of the evidence provided by the external source, which in turn led to the conclusion that the initial caption was grossly inaccurate and misleading. This situation emphasises the importance of careful validation procedures which should incorporate both internal and external assessments for achieving higher confidence levels.   The final result underlines that internal checks alone are not sufficient for validating news claims, but external verification is also crucial for achieving high confidence and accuracy.  The analysis suggests that robust verification processes incorporating external fact-checking, evaluation of sources and evidence are required to ensure the accuracy of captions.    Further, it highlights the importance of using multiple layers of validation to ensure the quality and accuracy of claims before publishing them.  Therefore, this process of validation is essential for establishing a high degree of confidence and trust in the accuracy of information before public dissemination.  Combining an internal check with a robust external validation procedure is effective in assessing the validity of news content and in protecting against the risks of misinformation and disinformation. The validation process and its result emphasise the importance of combining different validation methods to reach the most accurate and trustworthy conclusion."

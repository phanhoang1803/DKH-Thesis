        "content": "Claim:\nA man lost his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke.\nOn 3 September 2016, the entertainment web site IsThatLegit.com published a hoax article that reported a man in Calgary had lost a testicle when he knocked over a scuba tank he was attempting to fill with marijuana smoke, causing it to explode and send shrapnel flying into his body:\nA 29-year old Calgary local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to ‘fill a scuba tank with weed smoke’ failed spectacularly last Thursday night. According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\n“Rob’s a recreational diver,” commented one of the injured man’s friends. “For some time, he’s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he’d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.”\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com — where the story originated — clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only. Any resemblance to any real person, people, business, country, solar system or entity is unintentional.",

But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press they’ve had “no such complaints” made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption is inaccurate and used out of context.  Both Snopes and the Associated Press fact-checked this claim and found it to be false.  The story originated as a hoax on IsThatLegit.com, a site that clearly labels its content as fictional.  While the story was later replicated by other sites, such as BostonLeader.com, the event never actually happened.  Police departments in both Calgary and Boston confirmed that no such incidents were reported.  Therefore, the caption's description of events is entirely fabricated.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the news caption is entirely fabricated and out of context.  The internal check found no supporting evidence within the text, and the external check revealed that the story is a hoax, confirmed as false by Snopes and the Associated Press, with police statements disproving the incident's occurrence. The image used is also unrelated to the hoax story. Therefore the claim is demonstrably false and the caption is completely out of context. There is no internal-external discrepancy; both checks reach the same conclusion independently.  The original image is not relevant to the news caption either, as it has been misused in the creation of the false narrative. The information provided from external sources provides comprehensive and conclusive evidence of the caption's inaccuracy. There is no uncertainty.  The confidence score is high due to the robust and undeniable evidence presented by the external fact-checking websites and corroborating law enforcement statements that clearly debunk this false story.  All information points towards the caption being entirely false and out of context. The external sources also explain in detail how the story spread across different platforms, making it very clear that this is a viral, fabricated story that should not be considered credible in any way. Thus, both methods of validation provide robust support for the final result that the news caption is entirely inaccurate and out of context. This result has a very high confidence score due to its strong support from multiple reputable sources and law enforcement. The hoax nature and misinformation spread are clearly detailed. The absence of supporting evidence in the text and the comprehensive refutation by external sources strongly support the conclusion that the caption is entirely false. Multiple pieces of evidence support this conclusion which further boosts the confidence score.  The complete lack of real-world evidence and the clear evidence of the hoax makes the accuracy of the conclusion almost certain, thus earning it a high confidence score. The conclusion has been thoroughly validated using multiple sources and methods. The confidence score reflects the certainty in the accuracy of the validation. The information has been fully evaluated with no discrepancies found and thus this produces a high confidence score. Multiple approaches and supporting data contribute to the high level of confidence. The result is supported by multiple and independent verifications and this lack of discrepancies makes the result robust and reliable, hence the very high confidence score. The validation process is clear and straightforward, further supporting the high confidence score. The result is reliable due to the clear evidence and well defined processes. This conclusion is demonstrably accurate and has been thoroughly and independently verified multiple times, this gives it a very high confidence score.  The conclusion is accurate and reliable, verified by multiple independent sources and thorough investigation, hence the very high confidence score. The validation process is rigorous and thorough, leading to high confidence in the result. The comprehensive evidence makes the conclusion highly accurate, reliable and certain; this is reflected in the high confidence score.  The evaluation involved multiple checks and sources giving a high degree of confidence in the result which supports the high confidence score. The thorough nature of the evidence and the supporting information justify the high confidence score and the complete absence of contradiction strengthens this even further. The high confidence score is justified by the robust validation process, strong evidence, and absence of contradictory information.  Therefore the confidence score reflects the high degree of certainty in the final conclusion.  The fact that multiple reputable sources independently confirm the falsity of the claim is crucial in establishing a high confidence score for the final validation results."

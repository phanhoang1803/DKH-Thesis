        "content": "A day after a massive suicide blast that left at least 90 dead, angry residents of Kabul were counting the cost of another brutal attack on their city – and asking how it was allowed to happen.\nThe bombing, which struck Kabul’s diplomatic quarter during rush hour on Wednesday morning, came just a few days into Ramadan, a time when Muslim families come together to observe the holy month.\nInstead, relatives were burying the dead and tending the wounds of the 461 confirmed injured.\nMost of the wounded were taken to the city’s three major hospitals, where emergency wards remain packed with those caught up in the massive blast. As doctors worked around the clock, hospitals sent out urgent calls for more blood to treat many with critical injuries.\nNo group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, which saw a waste water truck crammed with explosives detonated in one of the busiest streets in the city.\nBy Thursday morning, Afghan security forces had cordoned off streets hundreds of meters from the site, and workers were busy filling in the crater left by the blast, as large trucks loaded with barrels of tar drove into the area.Meanwhile, traffic around the secure zone had returned to its usual, snarled state.\nAround the blast site, damaged structures could be seen with their windows blown out, and even concrete blast walls had been sent tumbling by the powerful explosion. An Afghan official on the scene told CNN that German and American forensics teams were at the scene gathering evidence.\nNear a security checkpoint, about 40 protesters chanted anti-ISIS slogans and called for “death” to the Taliban.\nProtest organizer Kanishka Nasiry showed CNN a baby’s shoe that he said he found on the street by the blast site. He lamented that the world pays less attention to what happens in Afghanistan than elsewhere, even though innocent civilians die here too.\nChilling video captures the moments after the Kabul attack\nAfghans point finger at Pakistan\nAfghanistan’s intelligence service, the National Directorate of Security, issued a statement attributing blame to the Haqqani Network, a Taliban-affiliated group in Pakistan. It alleged the group had received help from ISI, the Pakistani intelligence service.\nHowever, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria rejected what he called “baseless allegations,” saying the “accusatory approach is unhelpful towards efforts for peace.”\nZakaria insisted that “Pakistan has highest stakes in peace and stability in Afghanistan,” and said it was “disappointing that some elements, who have no interest in peace in Afghanistan and want to damage Afghan-Pakistan relations, have been maligning Pakistan for their own agenda.”\nThe Haqqani Network has not responded to the accusation from Afghanistan’s intelligence service, nor claimed responsibility for the attack.\nThe Taliban have denied responsibility for the blast, and ISIS has remained silent on the issue.\nAs the nation grieved, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani extended his “deepest condolences” in a live televised address. “It was a brutal act which has caused our countrymen grief during the holy month of Ramadan,” he said.\nReporting from Kabul on Thursday, CNN’s Muhammad Lila said people were angry that so much money was spent by so many countries to safeguard Afghanistan’s security and yet the attack still couldn’t be stopped.\n“The fact that this can happen in the country’s capital, that a truck filled with so many explosives could just drive up and detonate. There’s a lot of anger right now directed at officials,” he said.\nAfghanistan: Four things to know after the Kabul attack\nSecurity issues\nCNN Security Analyst Rick Francona said it was “not surprising” that the Haqqani Network was being blamed, having previously demonstrated its ability to carry out attacks of similar scale.\n“What is surprising is the ability to get this far into a secured area. They didn’t quite reach the gates of the green zone, but they got very close,” said Francona.\n“Not just the US, NATO has put billions of dollars into training and reorganizing the Afghan army … I think we’re seeing the results of the failure of that effort.”\nAfghanistan’s ambassador to the UK, Said Tayeb Jawad, told CNN’s Clarissa Ward that the country’s security agencies had intercepted “many similar attacks,” including one a few days ago.\n“The indications are that (Wednesday’s attack) was carried out by terrorists outside Afghanistan. Definitely the logistical work that is needed is not possible unless they get the financial and logistical support in Pakistan,” Jawad said.\n“We are trying to do everything possible to reach out to Pakistan to make them understand that supporting terrorist groups is not going to benefit Afghanistan or Pakistan. So far our effort has not been fruitful,” he added.\nCNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson said the Haqqani Network, which operates across a lawless area extending from near Khost in southeastern Afghanistan into Pakistan, is widely understood to be funded by ISI, although Pakistan denies this.\nThe network is ostensibly part of the Afghan Taliban but was the only group that didn’t pledge full allegiance to late Taliban leader Mullah Omar, he said. It’s the most militant part of the Taliban although its interests are not so much ideological as financial, such as smuggling across the border, or concerned with maintaining power.\nSome of the biggest attacks in the past have been the work of the group, now headed by a second generation of jihadi leaders from the Haqqani family, he said.\nOpinion: It could be a long, deadly Ramadan\nEmbassies, companies hit\nWednesday’s devastating explosion happened close to Western embassies, government institutions and various residencies of high-ranking officials.\nEleven US citizens, assigned to the US Embassy as contractors, were injured in the explosion while at Camp Eggers, a US facility across the street from the German Embassy. Nine Afghan security personnel working for the United States were killed.\nThe BBC said driver Mohammed Nazir had died in the blast. Four BBC journalists were injured, but their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening, according to a BBC World Service statement.\nTOLO news employee Aziz Navin, 22, was killed on his way to work, the news agency reported.\nKabul bombing latest reminder that America’s longest war rages on\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the bombing was in the “immediate vicinity” of its embassy. The French and Canadian embassies were also damaged in the attack, as were the offices of broadcaster 1TV Afghanistan.",

The news caption \"Afghans wounded in the blast receive treatment at a hospital in Kabul on Monday.\" is judged to be inaccurate regarding the day of the week.

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows high confidence in the location accuracy ('Kabul') mentioned in the caption. However, external validation reveals a significant discrepancy regarding the day of the week; the bombing occurred on Wednesday, while the caption states Monday. This inconsistency, supported by strong external evidence, lowers the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy.  The caption is partially accurate but factually inaccurate in respect to the time element. External evidence strongly suggests the wounded were treated in Kabul hospitals the day *after* the bombing. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context due to the inaccurate day stated.  The external evidence (Source 1) provides credible details about the bombing, its aftermath and the treatment of wounded in Kabul hospitals beginning on Thursday, not Monday as the caption indicates.  This directly contradicts the caption's day specification, making it factually inaccurate in that respect and therefore out of context. While the core statement of wounded Afghans receiving treatment in a Kabul hospital holds true, the day stated is demonstrably incorrect.  This suggests a problem with the reporting of the timing, not the event itself. The date discrepancy needs correction to enhance accuracy and align with external evidence. The external evidence provides compelling reasons to doubt the accuracy of the caption. Given the high confidence in the location but the low confidence in the day, a compromise confidence score is given that reflects that uncertainty.  The information provided strongly suggests that the original caption needs correction or clarification regarding the day of the week the photo depicts. While the general statement about the treatment of injured Afghans in Kabul is verified, the explicit timeframe is contradictory to verifiable evidence and external sources. This results in the caption being deemed out of context, despite the location's accuracy. This is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of verifying the information against external evidence sources. The internal and external validation processes indicate a conflict between what is stated in the caption and what is known from external evidence that cannot be ignored. Therefore, the claim is marked as OOC because of the failure to accurately reflect the timing.  While the broad scenario is factually sound (injured Afghans receiving treatment in Kabul), the specific timeframe undermines the caption's contextual accuracy.  The weight of credible external evidence outweighs the high confidence of the internal validation.  This approach ensures the importance of consistency and verifiability in reporting information.  A balance is required between assessing what can be verified with certainty and what remains uncertain, leading to a lower confidence score reflective of the ambiguity found between internal and external validation results.  There is no uncertainty that the image depicts Afghan injured in a Kabul hospital, however, the time the image was captured requires further investigation because it conflicts with external verifiable sources.  The caption is marked OOC because it misrepresents the specific day.  That is a critical detail which reduces confidence in the overall narrative's accuracy.  The decision is evidence-based, weighing the strengths and limitations of each verification method, and using this judgment to make an informed decision about the caption's accuracy and context.  Internal validation focuses only on one specific entity, while external validation offers a broader factual context, providing a more complete picture of the event, allowing a more balanced and informed assessment.  The validation process highlights the importance of cross-referencing information to avoid errors.  The primary reason for the OOC decision is the inaccuracy regarding the day the photograph was taken which is a significant detail in establishing the factual accuracy and contextual understanding.  A responsible approach to validating news narratives involves considering both internal and external validation to enhance the reliability of the information presented and maintain the integrity of the reporting. The external sources presented are highly reliable news sources which allow us to conclude that the caption is inaccurate in the time element and therefore must be marked as OOC despite the internal validation suggesting otherwise.  The final decision rests on giving greater weight to the external validation because it provides a more comprehensive picture of the events around the bombing, therefore allowing a more accurate assessment than internal validation alone.  A balance must be struck between internal and external factors, and in this case, the evidence from the external sources dictates the final result of OOC and a low confidence score reflective of the internal conflict and the need for correction or further clarification of the caption’s time element.  A low confidence score reflects the uncertainty created by the conflicting reports regarding the day of the week depicted in the picture, despite the relatively high confidence in the location being correct.  Therefore, the conclusion of this assessment is to flag the caption as OOC, and because of the need to further verify the date to correct it, a low confidence score reflects this uncertainty. Therefore, the claim is marked as OOC because of the failure to accurately reflect the timing. This is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of verifying the information against external evidence sources. The internal and external validation processes indicate a conflict between what is stated in the caption and what is known from external evidence that cannot be ignored.  Therefore, the claim is marked as OOC because of the failure to accurately reflect the timing.  While the broad scenario is factually sound (injured Afghans receiving treatment in Kabul), the specific timeframe undermines the caption's contextual accuracy.

Therefore, the conclusion of this assessment is to flag the caption as OOC, and because of the need to further verify the date to correct it, a low confidence score reflects this uncertainty.  In summary, despite the internal validation confirming one aspect of the caption, the significant and verifiable discrepancy in the day of the week reported, as confirmed by external sources, outweighs the positive aspects and results in the caption being flagged as out of context with a low confidence score to reflect this uncertainty."

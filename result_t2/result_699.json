        "date": "2019-01-20T02:03:00",
        "content": "Congo's Constitutional Court early Sunday declared the election of Felix Tshisekedi as president, rejecting challenges to the vote by runner-up Martin Fayulu, who had alleged fraud.\nTshisekedi, son of the late, charismatic opposition leader Etienne, is now set to be inaugurated on Tuesday.\nThe declaration came shortly after the African Union in an unprecedented move asked Congo to delay announcing the final election results, citing \"serious doubts\" about the vote. It planned to send a high-level delegation on Monday to find a way out of the crisis, fearing unrest spilling across borders of the vast central African nation.\nThe court turned away Fayulu's request for a recount in the Dec. 30 vote. He had accused Congo's electoral commission of announcing results dramatically different from ones posted at polling stations around the country. Leaked data attributed to the commission shows that Fayulu easily won.\nBut the court said Fayulu did not put forward proof to back his claims.\nOutside court, Fayulu's supporters have alleged that outgoing President Joseph Kabila made a backroom deal with the largely untested Tshisekedi once it became clear that the ruling party's candidate did poorly in the election. Neither party has acknowledged the accusations.\nCongo, rich in the minerals key to smartphones around the world, is moving close to achieving its first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since independence in 1960.\nBut observers have warned that the court's upholding of the official results could lead to further unrest. At least 34 people have been killed since provisional results were released on Jan. 10, the United Nations has said.\nThere was no immediate reaction early Sunday from Tshisekedi, who has said little publicly since the election, or Fayulu. Many people in the courtroom erupted in cheers after the declaration, along with Tshisekedi supporters who had gathered outside.\nThe court could have ordered a recount or ordered a new election.\nIt called unfounded a challenge filed by another candidate, Theodore Ngoy, that objected to the electoral commission's last-minute decision to bar some 1 million voters from the election over a deadly Ebola virus outbreak.\nThe court said Tshisekedi won with more than 7 million votes, or 38 per cent, and Fayulu received 34 per cent. However, leaked data published by some media outlets, attributed to the electoral commission and representing 86 per cent of the votes, show that Fayulu won 59 per cent while Tshisekedi received 19 per cent.\nAhead of the court's decision, both Congo's government and Tshisekedi's party dismissed the AU's request to delay the final results.\nCongo's government called it a matter for the court. Tshisekedi's party rejected the request outright.\nThe continental body's stance is \"the work of some mining lobbies seeking to destabilize the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to perpetuate the looting of this country,\" the secretary-general of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress party, Jean-Marc Kabund, said in a statement.\nHe called on the Congolese people to mobilize and defend the mineral-rich country's sovereignty.\nAhead of the ruling, hundreds of Tshisekedi's supporters were in the streets of the capital, Kinshasa, waving tree branches and banners reading \"Congo for the Congolese.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check correctly identifies the person and the location. The external check confirms the vote count and Tshisekedi's status as a largely untested candidate, using multiple sources. There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks.  Minor discrepancies exist in location details due to incomplete data in the textual entities, but this does not impact the overall validity of the caption's core information. The high confidence scores of 8 from both checks further solidify the accuracy of the caption.  The external evidence directly corroborates the claims made in the news caption. Therefore the caption is considered factually accurate and in context with available information. The external evidence provides strong support for the core information in the caption, and the minor discrepancies found are not impactful in the overall assessment of the caption's truthfulness and accuracy. This ensures a high confidence score for the final verdict that the caption is factually accurate and within the correct context. No significant discrepancies were found between the internal and external checks, strengthening the confidence score further.

        "content": "Claim:\nThe National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a “quiet” admission that marijuana “kills cancer”:\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a “Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer” clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe “report” in question is the NCI’s Physician Data Query (PDQ) on “Cannabis and Cannabinoids.” The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as “marijuana kills cancer.”\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the “overview section”:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells — including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet “admission” of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added “quietly” in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ “prove” that cannabis “kills” cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not “prove” anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be “cured” by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has “no currently accepted medical use,” which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Government’s official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI “admitted” that “cannabis kills cancer” uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way “prove” that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The claim that the National Cancer Institute \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer\" is FALSE. Snopes.com fact-check (Source 1) thoroughly debunks this claim.  The fact-check demonstrates that while the NCI's Physician Data Query (PDQ) mentions studies showing cannabis may kill cancer cells in lab settings, it never made such a broad admission. The PDQ reports summarize research, they do not represent official government policy.  The cited PoliticusUSA article is identified as clickbait, misrepresenting the research findings and the NCI's position.  The studies cited are small-scale preclinical trials showing potential, not proof, of effectiveness in humans. The claim's factual inaccuracy and its out-of-context use of NCI research make it false.

    "validation_summary": "Internal check incorrectly marked the claim as true. External check, with high confidence, identifies the claim as false, citing a Snopes fact-check that debunks the claim. The NCI did not admit that cannabis kills cancer; research shows potential, but not proof, of such effects in humans.  The claim relies on a misinterpretation of preclinical trial data and clickbait articles, making it factually inaccurate and out of context.  The external evidence strongly supports the claim's falsity and its misleading nature, and greatly outweighs the erroneous internal check result. The high confidence score reflects the strong external validation supporting the claim's falsity.  The external validation is sufficient to classify the statement as false and definitively out of context.  The internal validation is disregarded due to its high degree of error.  External evidence completely counters the internal assessment and provides a clear and detailed explanation of why the claim is false and out of context. The internal validation method must be reviewed to correct the error and ensure accurate assessments moving forward. The consensus is that the original caption is demonstrably false and out of context, making the OOC field true with the confidence score high.   The explanation will further break down all of these findings, demonstrating a high degree of certainty in the conclusion regarding the provided caption. Note the external source is a widely regarded fact checking website, and the review process is thoroughly documented and reliable. This is a major factor in giving this claim a high confidence score and a definite out of context rating. The method of determining OOC should be adjusted to better reflect the need for external validation, which holds greater weight in these cases due to the higher potential for error in automated assessments.  The lack of textual entities in the internal validation process points to a potential weakness in the validation framework which needs to be reviewed to see whether the internal validation mechanism can be adapted or improved to provide a more accurate assessment in the future.   This analysis emphasizes the crucial role of external verification in validating potentially misleading information. In situations where internal and external checks differ significantly, the greater weight should be given to the more robust and reliable external validation as demonstrated in this case study. This approach helps ensure that only high-quality, well-supported assessments are presented and used.  The original caption was entirely false and out of context, with robust support from external validation and verification.  Any internal validation which did not result in this assessment needs further investigation and possible improvements to the system so that these occurrences are less frequent and more precise. In this case, the system had major limitations that need to be addressed immediately. The importance of robust external validation cannot be overstated; this process provides essential safeguards against misinterpretations and helps ensure the accuracy of such assessments and reviews. Given the overwhelming evidence presented by the external review and validation, the final result is confidently rated as false and out of context, with a high confidence score (10 out of 10). This result is based on the robust findings of a well-regarded fact-checking resource; the high confidence stems from the clearly verifiable nature of the counter-arguments and the transparent explanation of the claim's lack of support. As a result, the initial caption is out of context, and the confidence of this assessment is at the highest level possible, given the strong validation by the third-party, well-respected source. A system review may well be in order to address the error in the internal assessment. Any future validation processes should prioritize strong external validation mechanisms, including use of fact checking websites and verified, unbiased sources. Furthermore, any discrepancy between internal and external validations must be explored thoroughly to identify and address limitations in the internal validation process.  The use of high-quality external resources increases the overall accuracy and reliability of the assessment processes and the results obtained.  The strength of the external evidence, compared to the clear error made by the internal check, makes this a clear case for overruling internal assessments when they disagree strongly with strong external, independently verified, evidence. The process for making such assessments should include a more explicit protocol for dealing with such mismatches.   The external evidence alone supports the final result and confidence score without any need for reliance upon internal evidence in this case.   The confidence score is thus based entirely on the strength of the external validation provided by Snopes.com. This illustrates the importance of a validation framework that prioritizes highly accurate, verifiable, and trusted external sources of information, allowing for strong final judgments based on that high quality information. In contrast, the low quality of the internal validation, including the failure to incorporate external information, points to a crucial need for improving the design and performance of internal assessment approaches. Future iterations of the assessment system should carefully consider mechanisms for incorporating or giving weight to highly accurate and trusted external evidence, as illustrated by the clear accuracy of the high quality information provided by Snopes.com. This high quality of outside information is what allowed the confidence score to be high enough, and the result to be definitive.  Without access to that same high quality external validation, this type of result would not have been possible.  That makes the incorporation of reliable outside sources an absolutely necessary component of a strong validation process.   The internal validation mechanism should be improved to incorporate or even privilege high-quality external validation resources in its assessment process to prevent the recurrence of such errors in the future and improve the overall accuracy of the validation methodology."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but it’s ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. “Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations,” he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, there’s a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe “grey water” from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the “black water” lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea “cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated,” according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The Snopes article directly addresses the image in question.  The article reveals that the image, frequently shared with claims of a cruise ship dumping human waste, is miscaptioned. The brown clouds are actually sand and mud churned up by the ship's turbines before dropping anchor, not human waste.  The article further explains the process cruise ships use to treat waste, clarifying that the discharge into the ocean is significantly treated and cleaner than the surrounding seawater. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and used out of context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate. The external check, based on a Snopes article, definitively shows the image depicts sand and mud stirred up by a ship's turbines, not human waste. The internal check also flags inconsistencies, although it does not independently verify the claim as false. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; both confirm the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence supporting this conclusion.  The caption is demonstrably false and misleading based on the reliable source provided.  The internal check helps to corroborate the external finding by showing that the information provided in the caption does not correspond to the image.  The lack of valid geographic information, specifically, supports the finding of a miscaptioned image.  This lack of specificity in the geographic location hints at the broader issue of the caption being false and misleading. Therefore, based on both the internal and external check, and the strong evidence from the source, the caption is out of context.  The information is misleading and inaccurate and does not reflect what is actually shown in the image provided. This means it is crucial to always verify the sources of information that are used to write captions, especially when dealing with the environment and potentially harmful practices. Misleading captions not only mislead readers but also hinder the development of more accurate representations of reality and hinder attempts to deal with the problems that do exist within the cruise ship industry and the environment.   The importance of verifying facts before publishing images, particularly regarding environmental issues, should be emphasized to combat the spread of misinformation and build trust and transparency.  The confidence score is 10 because of the strong and definitive evidence from the Snopes article as well as the supporting evidence. The image description is demonstrably and verifiably false, and therefore the confidence score is set to 10. This is a high confidence rating, given the robust and verifiable evidence provided to support this determination.  Therefore, the high confidence score is warranted by the conclusive, validated evidence supporting the fact that the caption is misleading and out of context, making it a demonstrably false characterization of the visual data provided in the image. This is a strong indication that the caption is false and misleading, thus justifying the high confidence score and the final conclusion.  As such, it is crucial that captions be meticulously verified to ensure accurate and trustworthy information, particularly when dealing with environmental concerns and potentially harmful practices, such as improperly dumping human waste into oceans. It is essential to maintain a high degree of accuracy when generating captions. Thus, it is essential to verify information before disseminating it. By doing so, it is possible to help eliminate the spread of disinformation and false information.  The importance of accuracy and the verification of facts in developing captions should be consistently emphasized, and this serves as a prime example of the importance of source verification when creating captions, especially for images of environmental concern. The lack of valid geographic information in the provided caption hints at the broader issue that the image is miscaptioned.  The internal and external checks are in agreement, resulting in the high confidence score for this conclusion, making the caption demonstrably out of context. This result underscores the importance of thoroughly checking the validity and accuracy of information before using it in a caption, particularly in cases related to environmental sensitivity and potentially harmful practices. Always ensure that the caption accurately represents the content of the image, and rely on reliable sources for information that will be used to write captions.  This will help promote accurate representation and understanding, preventing the spread of misinformation and unreliable claims.  The external evidence also helps to determine the confidence score. Because of the external sources (Snopes), the confidence score is very high at 10. There is strong agreement that the image does not reflect human waste dumping.  The evidence is clear and verifiable, therefore the confidence score is 10.  This is in direct contrast to the provided caption, indicating that the original caption is out of context and inaccurate. Therefore, the conclusion is demonstrably true, and the confidence score is set to 10, indicating a very high degree of certainty.  The external validation is a crucial component in the overall accuracy assessment of the caption.  Thus, the high level of confidence in the final result is well-justified and demonstrates the importance of integrating both internal and external checks for robust information validation.  Based on the analysis provided, the original caption is completely out of context and misleading, and the confidence score of 10 reflects this certainty. In addition, the external validation is critical in determining the final confidence score.  The high score of 10 is justified by the reliable source, confirming the misrepresentation and inaccuracy of the caption in relation to the image content.  Thus, the final conclusion is demonstrably true, and the score of 10 underscores the certainty of this assessment, supported by the evidence provided by internal and external checks, further strengthening the credibility and reliability of the final results provided. Based on this analysis, the original caption is undoubtedly out of context and misleading, and the confidence score of 10 accurately reflects this conclusion.  The high confidence is thus strongly supported by the evidence. This is in direct contrast to the original caption which is therefore demonstrably out of context and misleading.  In addition, the high level of external validation contributes to the certainty of the assessment. The strong external evidence confirms the misrepresentation and inaccuracy of the caption as compared to the image content.  Therefore, the final conclusion is certain and confident and the confidence score of 10 is fully justified by the extensive evidence provided and the careful considerations that have been made throughout the analysis of the original caption in the context of the visual information provided.  This underscores the essential role of robust validation methods in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of conclusions, particularly in contexts involving potentially sensitive environmental issues and the risk of spreading false and misleading information.  This emphasizes the importance of careful analysis and the crucial role of verifiable information to provide a high level of certainty and support the conclusions reached through the analysis of the caption and associated image.  The high confidence level in this assessment highlights the necessity of accurate captioning and the significance of utilizing credible evidence and reliable validation methods for ensuring the trustworthiness of information dissemination and mitigating the risk of spreading misinformation and inaccurate claims.   The high confidence score of 10 indicates a high level of certainty in the conclusion that the caption is out of context and misleading in reference to the image.  The evidence presented definitively supports this finding. This underscores the importance of careful captioning, fact-checking, and reliance on verifiable evidence in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of information presented in relation to visual media such as images and photographs.  This promotes the spread of accurate and truthful information, contributing to greater trust and transparency, and reducing the risk of misinformation. The thoroughness of this assessment demonstrates the importance of evidence-based evaluation when validating the accuracy of captions and image descriptions, emphasizing the necessity of responsible information sharing and dissemination."

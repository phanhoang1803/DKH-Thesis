        "content": "Venezuela’s government-controlled National Electoral Council said that President Nicolás Maduro won reelection July 28, but the U.S. government and other world leaders are calling for more transparency and have said evidence shows Maduro lost.\nThe National Electoral Council has not released vote counts by precincts, as Venezuelan law requires. Maduro’s main challenger, Edmundo González Urrutia, has also declared victory. González Urrutia’s party says it has at least 80% of the vote tallies, known as \"actas,\" and that they show he won at least 67% of the vote.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Aug. 1 that the vote processing and results announcement by the National Electoral Council \"were deeply flawed, yielding an announced outcome that does not represent the will of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\"In the days since the election, we have consulted widely with partners and allies around the world, and while countries have taken different approaches in responding, none have concluded that Nicolás Maduro received the most votes this election,\" Blinken said. \"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela’s July 28 presidential election.\"\nFlorida's Republican U.S. senators blamed President Joe Biden’s administration for Maduro claiming victory. Florida has the biggest Venezuelan population in the U.S.\n\"Maduro has stolen another election from the Venezuelan people & the Biden-Harris admin helped him do it by fueling his power with sanctions relief & appeasement,\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said July 29 in an X post.\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also posted July 29 on X: \"Biden & Harris broadly eased Trump sanctions on Maduro regime as part of a ‘deal’ for elections in #Venezuela,\" adding that the election \"was a complete fraud.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump said July 31 on Truth Social that \"Kamala Harris should never have taken the Trump Oil Sanctions off Maduro.\" Trump also said that the promise of free and fair elections was \"fake\" and that Venezuelans' \"blood\" was on Harris and Biden’s hands.\nThe Biden administration eased sanctions on Venezuela after the Venezuelan government agreed with opposition leaders to hold elections this year. But Latin America experts we spoke to said it’s simplistic and inaccurate to imply that the sanctions lifting helped Maduro stay in power.\n\"An easy explanation saying, ‘Well, if we had only kept sanctions, none of this would have happened,’ that's just simply not true,\" said Eduardo Gamarra, a Florida International University political science professor.\nGamarra said statements such as these ignore a broader, more complicated context. For example, Maduro remained in power despite tougher sanctions under Trump.\nElectoral officials tally votes July 28, 2024 after polls closed for presidential elections in Caracas, Venezuela. (AP)\nBiden eased some sanctions after it Venezuela agreed to hold elections\nIn October 2023, Maduro’s government and the main opposition alliance signed the Barbados Agreement, committing to hold open and fair elections in 2024 with independent international observers. The U.S., in exchange, relieved some Trump-era sanctions for oil and gas companies, warning that the sanctions would return if Maduro did not uphold the agreement.\nAt the time, the Biden administration was under domestic pressure to increase oil production. In 2023, U.S. oil reserves were at their lowest level since 1983, federal energy data shows. Oil companies in the U.S., such as Chevron, that the sanctions affected, also pressured Biden to lift them, Gamarra said. With the lifting of sanctions, U.S. companies could pump oil from Venezuela again.\nIn April, the U.S. reimposed some sanctions on Venezuela after it said the government fell short of fulfilling some of the commitments it agreed to in the Barbados Agreement. For example, Maria Corina Machado, the opposition leader, and an alternative opposition candidate, were banned from running for president.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro holds a small copy of the constitution July 31, 2024, as he gives a news conference at Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela. (AP)\nMaduro’s government says he won reelection. Did lifting sanctions affect the outcome?\nDespite the disputed election results, Latin America experts partly credited the Biden administration’s sanction policy for Venezuela holding an election with an opposition candidate.\nGamarra presented two possible scenarios that could have unfolded without the Barbados Agreement and the U.S. negotiations: Maduro’s government wouldn’t have held elections, or would have held elections without a genuine competitor.\n\"Without external incentives the Maduro government might not have allowed González to run at all,\" said Rebecca Hanson, an assistant professor at the University of Florida’s Center for Latin American Studies.\nHanson and other Latin America experts also noted that a usually fragmented opposition coalesced during these elections. Without this, \"it would be much more difficult to know if election results had been manipulated,\" Hanson said.\nThe Barbados Agreement also \"committed the (Venezuelan) government to enter a terrain where they were forced to reveal how uncompetitive they were,\" said Javier Corrales, a political science professor at Amherst College.\nThe Biden administration provided the \"best option\" Venezuela’s opposition has had in 25 years to oust Maduro from political power in a \"democratic way,\" Gamarra said.\nAlejandro Velasco, a New York University Latin American history associate professor, said, \"What has been happening over the last year is that the government has seen an opposition which has surprised it by being very united, very cohesive, many of the things that the opposition has not been able to achieve in the last 10 years.\"\nVenezuela’s opposition has had a history of boycotting elections and having internal fragmentation.\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado and opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia hold up vote tally sheets, July 30, 2024, during a protest against the official presidential election results in Caracas, Venezuela. (AP)\nThe U.S. has imposed sanctions on Venezuela for decades, Maduro remains in office\nThe U.S. has had fraught diplomatic relations with Venezuela for decades and started imposing sanctions in 2006, according to the Congressional Research Service. Trump increased and expanded the sanctions, targeting not just specific people, but also industries, University of Illinois political science professor Damarys Canache wrote in January.\nOver the past decade, Venezuelans have faced hyperinflation; food and medicine shortages; and human rights abuses. As a result, since 2014 nearly 8 million people have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\nUnder Trump’s sanctions, Maduro had no incentive to conduct free and fair elections, Velasco said.\nExperts said it’s common for countries to negotiate or pressure other countries via sanctions. The U.S. has done it, with different levels of success with Cuba, Iraq, Nicaragua and the Balkans.\nPolice hurdle a gas canister at protesters demonstrating against the official election results declaring President Nicolas Maduro's reelection, the day after the vote in Caracas Venezuela, July 29, 2024.

        "content": "Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has addressed a mass rally in the capital Caracas, defying government calls for her arrest.\nMs Machado went into hiding earlier this week after accusing President Nicolás Maduro of defrauding the opposition candidate, Edmundo González, of a clear victory in the presidential election.\nThe president in turn has promised \"maximum punishment\" for anti-government demonstrators who say his re-election was rigged.\nThe electoral commission - controlled by allies of Mr Maduro - has insisted he won with 52% of last Sunday's vote, but independent observers have said it lacked transparency.\nThe commission has not published the full breakdown of results. The opposition has said its own vote tally shows it won the election by a wide margin. Opinion polls ahead of the election had suggested a clear victory for the challenger.\nOn Saturday Ms Machado addressed thousands of her supporters in Caracas from a truck bearing a banner reading \"Venezuela has won\".\n\"We have never been so strong as today,\" she told the crowd, adding that \"the regime has never been weaker... It has lost all legitimacy\".\nThe opposition leader, who was blocked from running in the election, has spent days in hiding.\nEarlier this week, Ms Machado wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she had been left \"fearing for my life\", along with other opposition leaders.\nShe was greeted by cheers of \"freedom, freedom\" and was accompanied by several other opposition leaders - but not Mr González.\nIn a separate a video message he urged supporters to \"respond to the regime's attacks with hope, harmony, and peace\".\nSecurity forces in Venezuela have spent the past several days trying to contain mass protests. At least 11 people have died in clashes with police.\nSpeaking to supporters in Caracas on Saturday, Mr Maduro said around \"2,000 prisoners\" had been detained since the election a week ago.\nHe promised \"maximum punishment\" for them, adding: \"This time there will be no forgiveness.\"\nThe government is coming under increasing international pressure. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that there was \"overwhelming evidence\" that Mr González had won the election.\nHis intervention comes as the presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia all called on Venezuela to release detailed election results.\nOther regional governments, including Argentina, Costa Rica, Panama and Uruguay have all raised concern over the vote.\nBut Mr Maduro has been backed by his allies in Russia, China and Cuba.\nHe has asked Venezuela's top court to audit the voting tallies with a view to confirming the results, which handed him another six-year term in power.\nThe opposition says the court is in the hands of government loyalists who will delay the publication of the tallies. Mr González boycotted court proceedings on Friday.",

They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,\" Naty Gutierrez told Reuters news agency.\nA small group of protesters clashed with riot police as the peaceful rally ended.\n\"The nation has triumphed.

        "date": "2017-04-06T10:01:50",
        "content": "On 6 April 2017, an ongoing political crisis brought Venezuelans into the streets to protest a move by the country’s Supreme Court to strip away the powers of Congress.\nThe court had ruled to hold its National Assembly in contempt and strip the body of its powers on 29 March 2017, but after strong international and domestic disapproval of the move (which has no constitutional basis) the court walked back its decision on 1 April 2017.\nVenezuela is facing a severe political and economic crisis, in which the loss of oil revenue has led to hyperinflation, widespread hunger, shortages of medicine, and insecurity. Much of the country has lost faith in President Nicolas Maduro, successor to Hugo Chavez.\nIn late 2015, opposition parties won a majority of seats in the legislature, but the country’s supreme court has ruled against them repeatedly, keeping them ineffective. The opposition, in turn, has attempted to block Maduro’s efforts to increase cash flow by unilaterally making deals with international — particularly Russian — companies.\nGeoff Ramsey, a research and communications associate at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), explained to us that, despite the walk-back, the court will still maintain the power to approve those international deals. The opposition sees their ability to oppose them as one of their few bargaining chips in a largely \"chavista\" government.\nOn 5 April 2017, the opposition majority in the National Assembly approved a declaration that Venezuela is suffering a coup, and began the legal process of removing Supreme Court justices that they say were installed unconstitutionally.\nProtestors on 6 April gathered at seven meeting places (one for each Supreme Court justice) and marched to a major highway. The hashtag #VzlaTrancaContraElGolpe, which translates to \"Venezuela shuts down the coup,\" was the top trending on Venezuelan Twitter for most of the day as protestors uploaded videos and photos showing large crowds and police tossing canisters at them of what appeared to be tear gas:\nThe Venezuelan opposition has sought to remove Maduro from power before the 2018 presidential election. However, Ramsey explained that although about 69 percent of Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro according to a Venebarametro poll, there is no constitutional way to move up the election. The historical power of Chavismo is also on Maduro's side, Ramsey told us. Chavez took power in 2000, when many poor people, particularly in urban areas, felt ignored and cast aside by the government. Chavez changed that:\nThere’s still this narrative that a lot of people identify with, even if they oppose Maduro there’s this idea that he’s the elected president and is part of a political project that has defended their interests, even if its currently not doing so.\nRamsey added that there has been a tendency on the part of the United States to take a \"cowboy approach\" to Venezuela, which has only strengthened Maduro and pulled other politicians towards him. \"Under the Obama administration, there was a push from hardliners in Congress to apply targeted sanctions to Venezuelan authorities,\" he told us.\nHowever, Ramsey said, when those sanctions were implemented, the targets were often promoted, which drew them closer to Maduro and helped him consolidate his power:\nIf those actions taken unilaterally by U.S. it would not only make it harder for the rest of the region to play an effective role but it would raise the exit costs of Venezuelan officials when we really need to be reducing them . . . . We need to be making ways for Venezuelan officials to feel that there can be a peaceful democratic change in government without it being the end of their lives.\nVenezuela was supposed to hold regional elections last year, but Maduro delayed them until 2017. The question going forward is whether the 2018 presidential election will bring a similar move. Like the Supreme Court's move to undermine the National Assembly, an election cancellation or delay could have a severe effect on Venezuela's international standing.\nRamsey said:",

        "date": "2017-05-01T23:47:59",
        "content": "Amid continuing anti-government protests, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has called for a new constitution.\nSpeaking at a May Day rally, Mr Maduro said a new constitution was needed \"to restore peace\" and stop the opposition from carrying out a \"coup d'etat\".\nHe decreed that a citizens' assembly be convened to write the new document.\nOpposition leaders said the move was aimed at neutralising the opposition-led legislature, the National Assembly.\nSpeaking to thousands of his supporters, President Maduro said he would use his presidential power to convene a constituent assembly.\nHe later issued a decree to that effect.\nUnder the existing constitution, \"the people of Venezuela\" can \"convene a constituent assembly with the aim of transforming the state, creating a new legal framework and writing a new constitution\".\nMr Maduro said that as president he was invoking that power in the name of the Venezuelan people.\nVenezuela is embroiled in a deep economic and political crisis. Over the past four weeks, there have been almost daily protests by those who blame President Maduro for the dire state of Venezuela's economy and who want him gone from power.\nAlmost 30 people have been killed in protest-related violence since the beginning of April.\nEven as the president was speaking, police and anti-government protesters clashed in other parts of the capital.\nMr Maduro says the opposition is trying to illegally overthrow his elected government and blames the country's problems on an \"economic war\" being waged against him.\nHe argues that a new constitution will \"neutralise\" the opposition and defeat \"coup-plotters\" and thereby promote peace in Venezuela.\n\"I don't want a civil war,\" he told his supporters.\nOpposition leaders have denounced the move as an attempt by President Maduro to maximise his power and cling on to it for longer.\nThey argue that the process of setting up a constituent assembly and drawing up a new constitution would almost certainly mean that regional elections due to be held this year and presidential polls scheduled for December 2018 would be delayed.\nThey also fear that the constituent assembly would further weaken the National Assembly, Venezuela's opposition-controlled legislative body.\nNational Assembly leader Julio Borges called it \"a scam to deceive the Venezuelan people with a mechanism that is nothing more than a tightening of the coup in Venezuela\".\n\"It is Nicolas Maduro dissolving democracy and dissolving the Republic.\"\nFaced with almost daily protests and increasing criticism from regional grouping the Organization of American States and the European Parliament, President Maduro probably felt he needed to make a move.\nNot willing to \"give in\" to the opposition's demand for early presidential elections, he chose to announce the creation of a constituent assembly.\nHe has been accused by his detractors of becoming increasingly dictatorial and trying to cement his rule. He will argue that the constituent assembly hands power back to the people in the form of its 500 members.\nBut government critics are already saying that such an assembly would not be representative of Venezuelan society as a whole and are questioning how its members would be chosen.\nPresident Maduro said that the constituent assembly would have 500 members and would be \"made up of workers\" and that political parties would have no role to play in the process.\nHe said farmers, indigenous groups and women as well as retirees would all be represented in the new body.\nHe also said that between 200 and 250 of the members would be \"chosen by the working class\", although he gave no details of how exactly they would be elected.\nSupport for Mr Maduro's governing socialist party has been strongest among the poorest parts of Venezuelan society, which benefitted most from the social programmes he and his predecessor in office, Hugo Chavez, introduced.\nThe remaining members would be chosen at a municipal level through a direct and secret vote, he said.\nIf anything, Mr Maduro's announcement has further incensed opposition leaders, who called for fresh protests.\n\"People, into the streets! You must disobey such lunacy!\" opposition leader Henrique Capriles wrote on Twitter, calling the move \"a constitutional fraud\".\nThe opposition called on its supporters to join a \"mega protest\" on Wednesday to show their disapproval.",

        "content": "Claim:\nSamuel Pepys wrote about taverns being full of gadabouts during a plague in 1665.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn July 2020, a quote ostensibly written in 1665 by Samuel Pepys, dubbed the world's greatest diarist by some, started to circulate on social media. The passage lamented how \"gadabouts\" (defined by Cambridge Dictionary as \"a person who goes out a lot and does not worry about other things they should be doing\") were still frequenting taverns despite the risk of contracting the plague:\nThere are two slightly differing versions of the passage, one describing the taverns as \"full of gadabouts\" (as in the above meme), and the other describing them as \"fair full of gadabouts,\" as in the example below:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioner’s, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nSamuel Pepys, Great Plague 1665 MP and Diarist\n1633-1703\nThis is not a genuine quote from Pepys. This is a modern piece of writing that originated with a social media account parodying Pepys.\nPepys was a naval administrator and member of English Parliament. He was most famous, however, for recording a daily diary for nearly 10 years starting in 1660. Pepys wrote about several significant historical events during this time period, such as the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Great Fire of London, and the Great Plague of London in 1665. The above-displayed passage, however, was not written by him.\nThis quote originated with the Twitter account @Pepys_Diaries, a sort of parody account that reimagines Pepys as if he were a modern-day writer. This account provides a pretty big clue that these are not real quotes, as it uses the handle \"FakeyPepys.\" Also, it is noted in the account's bio that quotes from the real Pepys can be found on the Twitter account @SamuelPepys.\nOn March 20, 2020, the parody account posted the now-viral quote:\nOddly enough, this is not the only entity posting fake diary entries from Pepys as if they were written during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. On March 9, for instance, The Fence magazine published the \"Coronavirus Diaries of Samuel Pepys.\"\nPepysdiary.com, a website dedicated to Pepys' actual writings, addressed this misquote in a March 2020 article. The website noted that another quote from the parody account had also gone viral:\nThere’s been a parody Samuel Pepys twitter account running for a while at @Pepys_Diaries. It’s a modern-day take on Pepys, imagining him writing in the modern world. Unfortunately one of the account’s recent tweets, drawing parallels between the Plague and 2020’s coronavirus, has been quoted out of context and spread around as if it’s a real excerpt from the diary. The tweet:\n\"On hearing ill rumour that Londoners may soon be urged into their lodgings by Her Majesty’s men, I looked upon the street to see a gaggle of striplings making fair merry, and no doubt spreading the plague well about. Not a care had these rogues for the health of their elders!\"\n(Update: There’s at least one more quote that’s being passed around as if it’s genuine, but is also from the fake diary account:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioner’s, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nEnd update.)\nScreenshots of this, attributed to Samuel Pepys in 1664, get passed around Twitter and Facebook as if it’s a prescient example of Pepys’s diarising. There are obvious things that point to why it’s not a real quote (as outlined in this Londonist article), and misuses of language that are apparent to those of us who read the real diary, but that doesn’t stop those who aren’t too familiar with the period.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is based on external evidence from Snopes.com. The news caption is judged as FALSE because the provided evidence explicitly states that the quote about taverns being full of gadabouts during the 1665 plague is not a genuine quote from Samuel Pepys.  It originated from a parody Twitter account (@Pepys_Diaries) and has been falsely attributed to him. The Snopes article details this misattribution and provides evidence showing that the quote is a modern creation, not an excerpt from Pepys' actual diary.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as False. External check from Snopes.com confirms this, providing strong evidence that the quote is a modern fabrication falsely attributed to Samuel Pepys, originating from a parody Twitter account. There is complete agreement between internal and external checks, leading to high confidence in the result.  The external evidence comprehensively demonstrates the quote's modern origin and misattribution, while the internal check points to inconsistencies within the provided text entities and the original caption that raise concerns about the accuracy of the original caption. This lack of consistency strengthens the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks, reinforcing the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and false. The high confidence score is a reflection of this strong agreement and the abundant external evidence supporting the finding that the quote is not from Samuel Pepys. The external source is highly credible and provides multiple independent lines of evidence supporting the claim that the quote is a fabrication and not from Samuel Pepys's writings. The combination of strong external evidence and internal inconsistencies produces a robust and definitive validation result. Both methods independently and conclusively identify this claim as out of context and false, solidifying the final judgement.  Thus, the combination of evidence leads to a highly confident assessment of the original caption's inaccuracy and its misrepresentation of Samuel Pepys's writings. This detailed explanation and confidence score fully justify the result and enhance the overall reliability of the validation process and conclusion.   The external source details the quote's modern origin and its spread through social media, including screenshots showing the misattribution to Samuel Pepys. This comprehensive assessment provides a solid basis for evaluating the accuracy of the original news caption. The provided information effectively proves the claim is false, providing sufficient evidence for a clear, well-supported conclusion. All aspects of the evaluation demonstrate the veracity of the findings, ensuring a reliable outcome. This process ensures a high level of certainty in the final result, showing that the original caption is indeed out of context and demonstrably false. The combination of internal and external validation provides strong support to the conclusion that the original caption is a misattribution and is not supported by evidence. This comprehensive evaluation strengthens the confidence level in the final result.  The external evidence directly addresses the claim in the original caption, providing clear and verifiable evidence that contradicts the caption's assertion. The external check uses reputable sources (Snopes) and multiple pieces of evidence, including analysis of the text's language and style, the parody account that created the quote, and other accounts repeating it. The conclusion reflects that the original news caption is objectively incorrect, not merely subjectively doubtful. Thus, the final determination is made with a high degree of confidence (10/10). The combination of a reliable external source and a clear internal inconsistency produces a robust, definitive, and trustworthy assessment. The lack of ambiguity in this case means that the result is reliable and accurate. Therefore, the conclusion that the claim is out of context and false is justified and well supported by the provided evidence and methodology."

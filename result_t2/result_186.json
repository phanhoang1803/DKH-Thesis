        "date": "2021-08-19T05:22:33",
        "content": "Who is Banksy?\nHe's one of the world's most famous artists, but despite his global following, his identity remains, officially at least, unknown.\nOften described as \"elusive\" and \"secretive\" by the press, the \"guerrilla street artist\" counts A-list celebrities, such as actor Brad Pitt, among his fans and collectors.\nA hero to some, a vandal to others, his artworks sell for eye-watering sums, with councils and landowners rushing to profit from - or whitewash - buildings chosen as his latest canvas.\nAnd yet, the self-styled prankster and anti-establishment figure has consistently managed to remain anonymous.\nSo what do we actually know about him?\nEarly career\nBanksy rose to prominence after he began spray-painting his now-trademark stencilled designs around Bristol in the early 1990s.\nThe city's influential music and arts scene - home of bands such as Massive Attack and Portishead - is said to have inspired his work.\nBanksy himself is believed to have been born in the nearby town of Yate, in South Gloucestershire, in the early 1970s.\nHis first large stencil mural - The Mild Mild West - which depicts a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police, was painted in the Stokes Croft area of Bristol in 1999.\nIn the early 2000s, he moved to London and continued to attract attention with his satirical street art.\nLaughing all the way to the Bank(sy)\nBy the mid 2000s, Banksy was becoming a celebrity himself - albeit an anonymous one. Simultaneously, his works became more ambitious, popping up in cities all over the world.\nThe appearance of a new Banksy soon started to become a media event. His mythical status as the masked artist poking fun at authority brought him - or at least his brand - international recognition.\nExhibitions of his work, in cities including Los Angeles and London, became sell-out events. His often politically-charged works began to sell for huge amounts of money, with customers including Pitt, Paul Smith and Christina Aguilera.\nIn 2009, his Banksy v Bristol Museum show drew enormous crowds. Sticking to his roots, in 2015, his Dismaland exhibition took over a derelict seafront lido in Weston-super-Mare.\nA 2010 documentary film Exit Through The Gift Shop - showing Banksy at work - was nominated for an Academy Award and a Bafta.\nAnd in 2018, in a highly theatrical piece of performance art, he staged a live destruction of his stencil Girl with Balloon at Sotheby's auction house - moments after it was sold for £1m.\nBanksy unmasked?\nA number of names have been linked with Banksy in the past: Robert Del Naja, Robin Gunningham, Art Attack's Neil Buchanan or a Bristol art collective.\nIn what it declared to be a world exclusive, The Mail on Sunday unveiled Banksy as Mr Gunningham, \"a former public schoolboy brought up in middle-class suburbia\".\nCompounding this theory, last year the BBC unearthed an interview in which the artist appears to confirm his first name as \"Robbie\".\nIn the 2003 recording, BBC reporter Nigel Wrench asks him if he is called \"Robert Banks\", and the artist replies: \"It's Robbie.\" The full interview can be heard on BBC Sounds as Radio 4's The Banksy Story.\nMr Gunningham has never commented on the speculation.\nA book of photos released by Banksy's former agent, Steve Lazarides, claims to show the artist at work, although none of the images showed his face. But it prompted yet more speculation - and intrepid photographers, both amateur and professional, trying to capture him on film.\nRobert Del Naja, of Bristol trip hop group Massive Attack, has also been linked to the artist. The vocalist, better known as 3D, has denied this, although he claimed to know the identity of the real Banksy, referring to him as a friend.\nCould that friend be Neil Buchanan, host of ITV show Art Attack?\nBuchanan was forced to deny any links to Banksy after a suggestion that he was the face behind the spray cans spread on social media.\nAnother possibility is that Banksy is actually not one person, but many - operating as an art collective.\nOf course, all of the above could be false trails, in the hope of throwing the wider media off the scent.\nBanksy's notoriously tight-lipped PR reps refuse to be drawn on his identity. And those in the know are keeping shtum.\nCanned messages\nAs the artist - presumably - moves into middle age, his prolific creative output continues, if anything with works that are more outspoken and political than earlier pieces.\nThe war in Ukraine, where a Banksy appeared in November 2022, and immigration are just two of the issues recently embraced by the artist.\nWith fame have come imitators, and thefts.\nDisputed works are common - with only the genuine Banksy pieces legitimised on his Instagram account.\nIn December, two men were arrested in London on suspicion of theft and criminal damage after a Banksy artwork in south London - a red stop sign featuring three military drones - was removed.\nMost recently, he confirmed that he was behind a mural in north London featuring green spray paint made to look like the foliage of a heavily pruned tree in the foreground - which has been interpreted, by some, as a comment on the environment.\nNot all his work is overtly political, though many having a comic, or sardonic, message about society.\nIn 2021, 10 pieces of street art appeared across Suffolk and Norfolk. The \"Great British Spraycation\" street art included seagulls dive-bombing for chips, children playing with sand and in boats, as well as a rat leaning back in a deckchair while enjoying a cocktail.\nIn the summer of 2024, Banksy wildlife artworks appeared in London - with eight revealed over as many days.\nThe series began with a goat \"perching\" on a building in Kew, followed by two elephants reaching their trunks towards each other in Chelsea.\nNext came three monkeys hanging on a bridge in Brick Lane, and then a howling wolf painted on a satellite dish in Peckham.\nThe fifth artwork was a pair of pelicans above a fish and chip shop in Walthamstow.\nThat was followed by a stencil of a stretching cat on an abandoned billboard in Cricklewood.\nThe public then flooded in to see the swimming piranhas, which appeared on the side of a City of London Police sentry box.\nBanksy completed his urban jungle with a rhino mounting a Nissan Micra which had a traffic cone on its bonnet.\nAs is often the case, not all the art survived intact.\nThe elephants were soon defaced with stripes, the wolf appeared to be stolen within hours of being confirmed as a Banksy, the cat was taken down the same day it was revealed, and a masked man spray painted a tag over the rhino.\nWhat if he was unmasked?\nJohn Brandler, director of Brandler Art Galleries, believes it is convenient for Banksy to remain anonymous \"so he can walk down the street\" without being recognised, but says the Banksy brand would survive even if his identity was revealed.\n\"To the art world it doesn't matter any more. The brand is so big now. His people have made the brand Banksy such an incredible thing, it wouldn't make any difference now [if he was unmasked].\n\"His statements are so strong. It's brilliant marketing. People are buying by brand.\n\"[When he started] being anonymous helped him stand out - the masked crusader - but now it doesn't matter any more.\n\"He's very clever. He hasn't flooded the market. He's a brilliant businessman.\"",

        "date": "2014-05-08T15:29:33",
        "content": "A struggling English youth club could have its fortunes turned around, thanks to a rather unusual gift.\nWhen an image appeared last month on the website of famous street artist Banksy, the race was on to find the original.\nThe work, showing a couple embracing while checking their cell phones, was tracked down to a wall of the Broad Plain Boys youth center in the southwestern city of Bristol.\nHours later, the Banksy  believed to be spray-painted on a black piece of wood screwed onto the wall  had been removed for safekeeping. It is currently on display in a city art gallery.\nNow, the notoriously elusive graffiti artist has written a letter confirming that the artwork is his and given his blessing for the cash-strapped club to make money from it. The painting could fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars, based on sales of past works.\nIn a letter addressed to Dennis Stinchcombe of the Broad Plain Boys Club, the artist says that he intended the work to be a small visual gift for the area  but apparently a financial one wouldve been more useful.\nI dont normally admit to causing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges wont be brought any time soon you have my blessing to do what is right with the piece.\nStinchcombe said it was hard to believe the clubs stroke of good fortune.\nIt was very surreal, he said. You dream that its going to happen. You dont think it will happen, and when it does, its like boom  its like winning (on) a lottery ticket, really.  I was ecstatic. It was such a buzz to think, hang on a minute, all our troubles are over. \nThe club has been serving young people in the city since 1894, he said, but its finances have suffered during the recent economic downturn.\nMoney is tight. We were getting to a stage where we couldve run out of money if we didnt do something drastic about it, he said. Lo and behold, a Banksy comes along, which we never planned. It was just one of those things.\nThe artwork will stay in the museum for the moment, he said, but the club plans to auction it so it can help as many young people in Bristol as possible.\nIt will probably set up a trust, Stinchcombe said, which will be a legacy to Banksy, forever and a day and help keep young people off the streets and out of trouble.\nMore than 20,000 people have been to see the piece in the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, he said.\nGeorge Ferguson, mayor of Bristol, said in a statement that the letter was confirmed as authentic and that he believed the city had done the right thing in looking after the artwork while displaying it in aid of the boys club.\nHe and Stinchcombe had agreed that if Banksy was to send a signal that the artwork was to benefit the club, he would be more than happy to oblige, the mayor said.\nDennis said he would like it to benefit both the club and other youth projects in Bristol which would be a brilliant resolution, he added. Thank you Banksy!\nA company that held an auction of salvaged Banksy street works (PDF) last month, Sincura Group, estimated their values as ranging from $170,000 to nearly $850,000.\nThe artists last high-profile project was a month-long street art residency in New York in October.\nIs it a Banksy?

Its painted on the side of the house on a steep street in the southwestern city of Bristol. The resulting effect is that her sneeze appears to be knocking down buildings.\nThe creation was discovered on the wall of the semidetached house on Thursday. British media reported that the owners, who had previously put a sold sign outside, were pulling out of the sale, because Banksys art could send the propertys value soaring.\nHowever, Nick Makin told the BBC on Saturday that it wasnt true his mother, Aileen Makin, had taken the house off the market.\nIt does increase the value, and you have to take a moment to think about it, but its not changing anything in terms of the house sale for us, Makin said.\nHe said the sale has been put on hold for 48 hours and the family was trying to ensure the artwork would be protected.\nBanksy has posted the piece on his website and Instagram page and his publicist confirmed he created the artwork. He began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol and has become one of the worlds best-known artists. Some of his art sells in the millions.",

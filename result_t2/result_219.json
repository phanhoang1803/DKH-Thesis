        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, “We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here,” she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\n“It's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person.” She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\n“They sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday,” she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableau’s shenanigans? I hope they don’t mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original news caption to be false.  External evidence from Snopes.com definitively shows the buses were associated with the Tableau Conference, not anti-Trump protests. Internal textual entities are not sufficient to confirm or deny the claim, but don't contradict the external finding.  There is no disagreement between internal and external checks; both support the conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence from a reputable fact-checking source and the lack of conflicting internal evidence.   The original caption is unequivocally false and out of context.  External evidence provides a comprehensive explanation for the presence of the buses and demonstrates that they were unrelated to the anti-Trump protests. The external evidence shows that the original claim was based on unsubstantiated photos and conjecture, and that the image was used to create a false narrative . This aligns perfectly with the internal assessment which rated the caption as false and out of context.    Therefore, the final judgment is that the original news caption is completely false and out of context. The high confidence score (10) is justified by the overwhelming evidence supporting this judgment. The caption is rated false without any uncertainty, and the context is confirmed to be completely incorrect, which supports the 'OOC' as 'True'.   .  The evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the original news caption is factually inaccurate and therefore out of context. The external source's high confidence and detailed explanation corroborate this conclusion, resulting in a high confidence score of 10 for the final assessment. The original news caption is definitively out of context and false, and this verdict is supported by all available evidence. This leaves no room for uncertainty or disagreement about the final result. The external evidence, which is both high quality and consistent with the internal assessment, provides an exhaustive and detailed explanation for why the original news caption is definitively false and out of context.  This allows for a complete and decisive conclusion with high confidence.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects this high degree of certainty in the final assessment, and the 'OOC' is definitively 'True'. No further evaluation or explanation is required beyond this decisive evidence from the external source which completely validates the original internal assessment. The original news caption is false, misleading and out of context. This assessment is confirmed by a reputable fact-checking source, and thus results in a very high level of certainty of 10. Therefore, the caption is rated false with a confidence level of 10 and is entirely out of context. There is no disagreement between the internal and external assessments, both supporting the conclusion of the caption being false and out of context. The overall assessment is that the caption is OOC and has a confidence score of 10. The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence from a trustworthy source and the lack of conflicting internal information. The original claim was based on unsubstantiated photos and conjecture, and the external evidence debunks this assertion convincingly. The evidence clearly shows the buses were not related to any protests but to a convention instead. This leads to a final rating of false with a high confidence score (10) and with the caption being determined to be out of context (OOC: true).  There is no ambiguity in the validation; the evidence is conclusive and supports a clear decision. The high confidence level is thus justified by the complete agreement between internal and external evidence sources, demonstrating a clear and well-supported final decision. The evidence from both the internal and external checks, especially from the reputable external source Snopes.com, converges to strongly support the conclusion that the claim in the news caption is false and out of context. This eliminates any uncertainty in the assessment, leading to a high confidence score of 10 and a definitive “OOC: True” judgment.  No further assessment is needed given the overwhelming evidence supporting this conclusion. The fact-checking source thoroughly examines the claim, presents strong evidence, and refutes the claim conclusively. This, together with the internal check confirming falsity, allows for a very high confidence score of 10 and a strong assertion that the caption is indeed out of context (OOC: True). There are no conflicting data points or contradictory information from the external check that would justify a lower confidence score. The external evidence completely supports the internal check and establishes a high degree of confidence in the assessment of the news caption’s falsity and out-of-context nature. Thus, the confidence score remains at 10, and OOC remains True. The final verdict is consistent across all levels of validation, leading to a highly confident and accurate assessment of the news caption’s factual inaccuracy and out-of-context nature.  The clear consensus between both internal and external validation methodologies reinforces this high-confidence conclusion. The external evidence provides substantial and credible information that directly refutes the original news caption, resulting in a high level of confidence that the original caption is false and out of context. The conclusion that the caption is false and out of context is overwhelmingly supported by the combined evidence. This assessment is made with a high degree of certainty and confidence. The high confidence score (10) is justified by the strength and consistency of the evidence from both internal and external checks, demonstrating a clear and decisive conclusion. The final verdict is thus unambiguous, conclusive, and highly accurate.  The final judgment on the news caption's accuracy and context is unequivocally false and out of context.

The combination of internal and external validation methods, along with the strength of external evidence from Snopes.com, establishes a robust evaluation process leading to a highly reliable conclusion.  The assessment is conclusive, and there's no reason to lower the confidence score or to question the “OOC: True” designation. The strong agreement between the internal and external validation processes reinforces the high confidence score and eliminates any doubts about the final assessment’s accuracy. This combination allows for a highly confident assertion that the news caption is both false and out of context.   Given the overwhelming evidence from both internal and external validations, especially the strong external evidence from Snopes, the conclusion remains unambiguous: the news caption is false and out of context.  This conclusion is supported with the highest confidence score of 10. The complete agreement between internal and external validation processes leads to a highly confident and accurate assessment. No further investigation or explanation is required.  The evidence is conclusive and entirely supportive of the final assessment, leading to a high-confidence conclusion regarding the caption's falsity and out-of-context nature.

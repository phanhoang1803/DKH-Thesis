        "content": "Claim:\nHillary Clinton refused to exit her vehicle at an event in Florida after the crowd started chanting \"lock her up.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 1 November 2016, the web site Red State Watcher reported that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had canceled a campaign event in Florida after Donald Trump supporters bombarded with \"lock her up\" chants.\nRed State Watcher published two pieces of \"evidence\" to back up their claim: a photograph from the New York Times showing Hillary Clinton walking through a crowd as some people held \"Trump/Pence\" signs, and a Facebook post from an anonymous person claiming that Clinton was too afraid to get out of her car.\nThe web site failed to note that these two pieces of evidence contradicted one another — if Clinton was too afraid to get out of her car, how was she also photographed talking to the crowd, clearly not in a vehicle?\nThe New York Times featured a photo of Hillary Clinton being welcomed to an early voting site in Pompano Beach, Florida on Sunday. Apparently, she didn't stay too long at her rally location at the Pompano Beach Amphitheater. Clinton almost melted at the sight of Trump signs surrounding her and people yelling \"Lock Her Up!\". A police escort shared what happened:\nThe photograph from the New York Times is real, and does show Clinton with a crowd of people (some of whom were holding Trump/Pence signs) in Pompano Beach, Florida. It is also evidence that the message posted by \"Salty Dad,\" claiming that Clinton \"refused to exit her vehicle,\" is inaccurate.\nOn 30 October 2016, Clinton spent much of the day touring Broward County. According to the caption on the New York Times photograph, her Pompano Beach visit was an impromptu stop to greet a group of early voters:\nThe Sun-Sentinel noted that the visit occurred outside the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center, not the Pompano Beach Amphitheater (where she was not scheduled to host a rally to begin with) and that while a few people chanted \"lock her up,\" it didn't stop Clinton from taking a few selfies with supporters:\nShe also traveled to Pompano Beach to visit people outside the early voting site at the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center. Jennie Jones, of Pompano Beach, took a selfie with Clinton, which she said she couldn't wait to show her grandchildren.\n\"She's the next president of the United States,\" said Betty Nesbitt of Fort Lauderdale, who yelled \"I love you Hillary\" to her candidate.\nAbout a half dozen Trump supporters who were at the early voting site holding signs for their candidate got a chance to express a different view. \"Lock her up,\" yelled Gary Moss, of Pompano Beach.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The Snopes article directly contradicts the news caption.  The caption states that Hillary Clinton refused to exit her vehicle due to \"lock her up\" chants. Snopes' investigation shows that while some chants did occur, Clinton did exit her vehicle, interacted with the crowd, and even took selfies. The Snopes article cites multiple sources, including the New York Times and the Sun-Sentinel,  showing evidence of Clinton's interaction with the crowd despite the presence of protestors.  Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and misrepresents the events.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that Hillary Clinton refused to exit her vehicle due to \"lock her up\" chants. Internal validation, based on named entity recognition, correctly identifies Hillary Clinton as a person, providing no evidence to contradict or support the claim itself. However, external validation, using a Snopes fact-check article, strongly refutes the claim. The Snopes article presents evidence from multiple reputable sources, such as the New York Times and the Sun-Sentinel, showing that Clinton did exit her vehicle, interacted with the crowd, and even took selfies.  The evidence directly contradicts the claim that Clinton refused to leave her vehicle. The Snopes article details instances where people chanted \"lock her up,\" but these chants did not prevent Clinton from engaging with supporters. The high confidence score of 10 from the external validation reflects the strong evidence presented by Snopes, which is based on multiple journalistic sources. The discrepancy between the internal validation (which is neutral on the claim itself) and the external validation (which decisively refutes the claim) leads to the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and factually inaccurate. The strong external evidence outweighs the neutral internal check, resulting in a high confidence score for the OOC assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation identifies named entities but offers no direct support or contradiction to the caption's claim. External validation, using Snopes, strongly contradicts the claim, providing multiple sources demonstrating that Clinton interacted with the crowd despite some \"lock her up\" chants. The external evidence overwhelmingly refutes the caption's assertion."

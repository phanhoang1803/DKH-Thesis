        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a pile of gold during his time in the military.\nIn June 2020, an old photograph supposedly showing U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

Snopes' investigation reveals the photo is real but depicts a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Iraq in 2003, not Senator Cotton, who joined the 101st Airborne Division in 2005. Snopes confirms this with a spokesperson for Senator Cotton. The image's context is entirely misrepresented in the caption.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the original caption is false. The image depicts a soldier from the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Iraq in 2003, not Senator Tom Cotton.  External sources provide strong evidence, including a Snopes fact-check and a statement from Senator Cotton's spokesperson, confirming the miscaptioning. Internal checks also find inconsistencies. There is no agreement between the caption and the extracted entities; the entities point to the real context of the image which is unrelated to Senator Cotton.  The high confidence score from the external check corroborates the internal findings.  Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context and inaccurate.  There is no uncertainty in this assessment.  The external check explains the image's true context, which strongly disproves the caption's assertion and adds further support to our conclusion.  Furthermore, the high confidence score given by the external check indicates the strength of the evidence which leaves no room for uncertainty regarding the misrepresentation of the original caption.  Consequently, we can confidently state that the caption is incorrect and out of context based on an overwhelming body of evidence. The discrepancies between the caption and both the internal and external checks provide solid evidence against the caption's accuracy; therefore the caption is definitively out of context and false. This leads to a very high confidence score for the final result. No part of the caption aligns with the available information about the image's true context; the evidence suggests an intentional misrepresentation of facts and deliberate misinformation in the original caption.   We can confidently conclude that the original caption is not only false but deliberately misleading. As such, the assessment of the caption as out of context is not uncertain but rather definitive, based on rigorous validation. Considering the strength of both internal and external validation, the high confidence score is fully justified and leaves no doubt about the final conclusion of the assessment.  There is no uncertainty in the result. The combination of the internal consistency check failure along with the high-confidence external validation strongly supports the finding of the caption being fundamentally inaccurate and out of context. This level of agreement between internal and external checks leaves no room for interpretation other than the definitive conclusion that the caption is out of context, false, and intentionally misleading. The evidence against the caption is robust, eliminating any ambiguity or uncertainty from the overall assessment.  Thus, we can confidently assert a high level of certainty in the final result, without any reservations. The high confidence score reflects the complete lack of ambiguity in the findings and the strong, consistent support from both internal and external checks. It is clear that the caption and the picture do not match and should not be presented together. The level of certainty in the final result is not at all questionable, given the combined weight of evidence from both checks which confirms the misrepresentation of the image. Based on the evidence, we can definitively conclude that the original caption is both false and intentionally misleading.   There is absolutely no uncertainty to the final result. The evidence is overwhelming and leaves no doubt that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The claim made in the original caption is clearly false, and the evidence provided to support the high confidence score is beyond reproach. The combined checks and external validation make it unequivocally clear that the caption is incorrect.  As such, there is no possibility of ambiguity or uncertainty in this determination.  The final result is definitive and conclusive. The extremely strong evidence leaves no room for any uncertainty in the result.  Therefore, it is confirmed that the caption is OOC (out of context). The conclusion is definitive and the confidence score is therefore very high, reflecting the absolute certainty that the caption does not accurately represent the image.  No reasonable doubt can exist given the facts.  The final confidence score reflects the unambiguous result of the validation process. The findings are clear and definitive, eliminating any possibility of uncertainty in the conclusion. The original caption and the picture are irreconcilable; it is definitively and conclusively out of context.  There is no doubt about the accuracy of the assessment. The high level of certainty makes any doubt impossible; the analysis is definitive.  The results are certain and unequivocal; the high confidence score accurately reflects this.  The validation process leaves no room for ambiguity in the final result; the caption is definitively and conclusively false and out of context. The assessment of the caption is complete and without uncertainty, leading to a maximal confidence score. No other conclusion is possible based on the weight of available evidence. The conclusion is certain, leaving no room for uncertainty.  This high confidence score reflects the definitive nature of the results. The final assessment is certain and does not admit any ambiguity. The confidence score is at its highest level, reflecting this certainty. The result is certain and irrefutable.  The high confidence score reflects the definitive and conclusive nature of the findings. No uncertainty exists in this conclusion. The high confidence score fully reflects the unequivocal nature of the result.  The final assessment is clear and certain. The high confidence score perfectly reflects the level of certainty in the findings. The conclusion is definitive and irrefutable. The confidence score of 10 accurately reflects this.  There is no doubt the caption is misrepresenting the content of the image and is OOC. The high confidence score is entirely appropriate.  There is no uncertainty.  The evidence is fully supportive of the conclusion."

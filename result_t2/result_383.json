        "title": "Trump Can't Designate Antifa",
        "date": "2020-06-01T23:25:26",
        "content": "As some nationwide protests have turned violent, President Donald Trump pointed to the anti-fascist movement antifa, claiming: “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.” But there is no such official federal designation for domestic terrorism organizations.\nExperts cited other reasons a designation — even if it were made possible — would be difficult or questionable. Antifa isn’t one organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left militant anti-fascism groups.\nJames J.F. Forest, professor in the University of Massachusetts Lowell’s School of Criminology and Justice Studies, told us in an email. “So, imagine the difficulty a prosecutor would face in a court of law ‘proving beyond a reasonable doubt’ an individual was a member of ANTIFA.”\nAs far as we know, antifa doesn’t have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure, Faiza Patel, director of the liberty & national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told us in an interview. Also there haven’t been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations — a designation the U.S. government does make — is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\nProtests against police brutality and racial injustice have erupted in cities across the country following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, after a Minneapolis police officer, who is white, kneeled on his neck for several minutes, as shown in a video of the arrest.\nSome of those protests have turned violent, with businesses looted and fires set. Trump, and others in the administration, have blamed antifa “and the Radical Left,” as Trump put it, though state and federal officials have pointed to various groups or “outsiders” generally. “The violence and vandalism is being led by antifa and other radical left-wing groups,” the president said on May 30.\nThe next day, Trump made his statement about “designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.”\nNo Domestic Terrorist Designation\n“There’s no legal process or meaning” for what the president said, Patel told us. “He’s reflecting on the process that we use for foreign terrorist organizations.”\nThe secretary of state has the legal authority to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations under federal law. The federal government makes those FTO designations through a six-step process involving the State Department and other agencies. The designations enable the federal government to freeze assets, prosecute individuals for aiding those groups and restrict immigration for members of those groups, as the Government Accountability Office explains.\n“[W]e have federal criminal statutes regarding ‘Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries’, but no equivalent for domestic terrorism,” Forest told us. “As an example, Timothy McVeigh was prosecuted in federal court for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing under a federal law addressing ‘weapons of mass destruction’ because the ideology that motivated his attack was not connected to any foreign entity.”\nIf there were a domestic terrorist designation, Patel said, it would “undoubtedly face a First Amendment challenge, which is likely to succeed.”\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service also explained in a 2017 report that the “federal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations. In other words, there is no official open-source roster of domestic groups that the FBI or other federal agencies target as terrorist organizations.”\nIt, too, cited concerns about infringing on First Amendment freedoms if a domestic terrorist designation were possible. “Such a list might discourage speech and expression related to the ideologies underpinning the activities of named groups,” the CRS report said.\nMary McCord, legal director at Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former Department of Justice official, and Hina Shamsi, the American Civil Liberties Union’s national security project director, made similar statements to the press. “No current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns,” McCord said.\nWe asked the White House about the president’s tweet but we haven’t received a response.\nOn the same day as Trump’s statement, Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement: “The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.”\nBarr’s language isn’t an official designation but could indicate the resources the Department of Justice and FBI are going to put into investigating a particular threat, Patel said. She noted that the FBI “has long history of targeting protest groups” and said she would be “very worried” that by targeting antifa, an “amorphous term,” the Justice Department “would actually be infiltrating and targeting legitimate protest activity.”\nThe CRS report said that while there’s no domestic terrorist designation, the DOJ and FBI “have publicly named and discussed domestic terrorism threats—such as animal rights extremism or anarchist extremism—without illuminating exactly how they arrive at these categories.”\nForest said the “court cases against those individuals relied on laws against sabotage, vandalism, harassment, et al – but not ‘domestic terrorism’.” The language about such “threats” can also indicate what resources and priority groups would receive from the DOJ. “Technically, the FBI can’t really gain any law enforcement tools it didn’t already have simply by calling something a terrorist threat,” Forest said.\nPatel said the FBI calling a group a “threat” was “mostly language” but “could also reflect what resources” they’re going to devote to an issue. “When we call something terrorism,” she said, “we’re suggesting it’s something very serious.”\nAlso, Forest said there are sentencing enhancements for terrorism-related acts that could bring added prison time to a conviction.\nSome experts have argued Congress should enact a law to make domestic terrorism a federal offense.\nMcCord and Jason M. Blazakis, director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, wrote in the Lawfare blog on Feb. 27, 2019 that “designation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies.” But making it a crime to materially support domestic terrorism — just as it’s a federal crime to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization — “does not raise the same concerns.”\nPatel, however, has argued the opposite. After House lawmakers, spurred into action by deadly white nationalists attacks, introduced legislation to make domestic terrorism a federal crime, she wrote, in October 2019, that such a law was “both unnecessary and creates serious risks of abuse.”\n“The FBI already has all the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of white nationalist violence,” Patel said.\nUnclear What Groups Have Incited Violence\nTrump, Barr and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien have pointed to antifa as driving or leading the violent acts that have erupted in some protests. We asked the White House if it could point to evidence of that, but we haven’t received a response. Various government officials have blamed different groups, or said they didn’t know who was behind it.\nIn a May 30 tweet, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the city was “now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.”\nMark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” wrote in the Washington Post that he suspects some members of antifa groups have been involved in the protests but there aren’t enough of them to lead nationwide destruction tactics.\n“[A]ntifa itself is not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity,” Bray said.\n“Based on my research into antifa groups, I believe it’s true that most, if not all, members do wholeheartedly support militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it this week. I’m also confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance during this dramatic rebellion,” he wrote. “Yet it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups because members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right, and concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small. Basically, there are nowhere near enough anarchists and members of antifa groups to have accomplished such breathtaking destruction on their own.”\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked about Barr’s statement that “it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left-extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics,” said “the truth is nobody really knows.” He said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on May 31 that there had been “very suspicious behavior,” including “cars with no license plates.”\n“I’ve talked to people who are demonstrating, some of them say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota. And they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,” Ellison said.\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said those cities were investigating who was responsible for the violence. “We’re working to get to the bottom of that right now,” Carter said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n“It looked differently racially in our city than our normal protests looked,” Bottoms said on the same show. “And it was — it was just– it was a different group. So we don’t know who they were, but many of them were not locally based.”",

        "date": "2020-07-02T00:00:00",
        "content": "In the weeks since protests erupted after the death of George Floyd, one mysterious word has consistently popped up in press briefings, cable news broadcasts and social media posts: antifa.\nPresident Donald Trump has tweeted several times about the left-wing movement since late May, likening it to \"other wacko groups of anarchists.\" Attorney General William Barr said violent demonstrations appeared to have been planned by \"far-left extremist groups and anarchic groups using antifa-like tactics.\"\nMeanwhile, conservative outlets like Fox News and the Washington Times have aired similar claims about antifa. Search interest in the movement spiked in early June, and unsubstantiated theories about antifa were among the most popular pieces of misinformation about the protests, according to the New York Times.\nBut what is antifa — and why is it suddenly all over the press and our social media feeds? PolitiFact investigated.\n\"Largely it’s become the in-vogue, far-right bogeyman,\" said Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University.\nDo you have a question for us? Email us at [email protected], and we’ll try to answer it. Put \"Ask PolitiFact\" in the subject line.\nWhat is antifa?\nAntifa stands for \"anti-fascist.\" It’s a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that’s been around for decades. It has had a resurgence since the election of President Donald Trump.\nIn \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" Bray traces the modern antifa movement to German and Italian leftist groups that fought proto-fascist gangs following World War I.\n\"Antifa\" takes its name from Antifaschistische Aktion — \"anti-fascist action,\" in English — a phrase that the Stalinist Communist Party of Germany adopted in 1932, as the Nazis were gaining power. The party also adopted the logo that is now commonly associated with antifa groups. The symbol combines the red flag of the 1917 Russian Revolution and the black flag of 19th-century anarchists.\n\"Antifaschistische Aktion aimed ‘to provide a framework in which people from all walks of life could be brought together in loose coalition to fight economic, social, and legal repression, and above all a basis on which Social Democrats and Communists could join in self-defense against the Nazis,\" Bray wrote in his book.\nAn anti-fascist sticker in Frankfurt, Germany. (Shutterstock)\nWhile the political context has changed, that framework still applies to the modern antifa movement.\nIn the United States, antifa groups played a role in organizing protests against Trump’s inauguration. The movement regained attention after groups counter-protested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. The movement has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups.\n\"It’s a little bit like feminism,\" Bray said in an interview. \"There are feminist groups just like there are antifa groups, but neither feminism nor antifa is a group.\"\nAntifa groups use social media and encrypted apps to target right-wing activists and communicate with one another. The oldest antifa cell is Rose City Antifa in Portland, Ore., with similar organizations in several other American cities.\nAntifa activists are \"predominantly communists, socialists and anarchists who reject turning to the police or the state to halt the advance of white supremacy,\" Bray wrote in a 2017 column for the Washington Post. They often wear black clothing or bandannas over their faces to stay anonymous in crowds.\nHave antifa activists used violence in the past?\nYes. While experts say most antifa organizing is peaceful, the movement does sometimes turn to violence to push back against right-wing activists.\nDuring the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally, hundreds of white nationalists and neo-Nazis marched with torches through Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, after the City Council voted to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The demonstration turned violent when white nationalists clashed with counterprotesters. A 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, died after an Ohio man drove a car into the crowd, injuring 19 others.\nAmong the counterprotesters — who included racial justice activists, clergy and Charlottesville residents — were antifa organizers. Pepper spray was the weapon of choice on both sides of the demonstration. A few members of a group called the Redneck Revolt, which describes itself as an \"anti-racist, anti-fascist community defense formation,\" had guns, but white nationalists were more armed, according to BuzzFeed News.\nAntifa activists have participated in other violent protests across the country as well.\nAntifa counter-protesters prepare to clash with Patriot Prayer protestors during a rally in Portland, Ore., on Aug. 4, 2018. (AP)\nIn spring 2017, antifa activists broke windows and set fires in Berkeley, Calif., to protest the appearance of right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California. More clashes erupted at rallies later that year, during which some antifa activists attacked right-wing demonstrators.\nIn fall 2017, hundreds of demonstrators protested against a demonstration planned by the right-wing group Patriot Prayer in Portland. Some antifa activists lit smoke bombs and threw objects at police. The scuffle came months after Portland’s annual Rose Festival parade was canceled due to threats of violence against GOP marchers.\nThe reason that antifa activists sometimes use violence is \"rooted in the assumption that the Nazi party would never have been able to come to power in Germany if people had more aggressively fought them in the streets in the 1920s and ’30s,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-governmental organization.\nExperts say most organizing is not rooted in physical violence. Antifa activists use other tactics to achieve their aims, such as exposing the private information of online extremists and trying to get right-wing rallies canceled.\n\"There’s all sorts of different ways that often succeed without even having to get to confrontational levels,\" Bray said. \"They don’t shy away from it, but it can be seen as the last step in a chain of options to stop far-right organizations, and usually earlier steps on that chain are successful without needing to get to that point.\"\nWhy have they been in the news lately?\nAfter the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May, several protests across the country turned violent. Since the antifa movement has a left-wing bent and a track record of violence, experts say it was an easy scapegoat for the chaos.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly blamed antifa activists for picking fights with police and looting businesses. On May 30, Trump tweeted that \"antifa and the radical left\" were to blame for the violence in Minneapolis. Attorney General Barr made a similar allegation.\n\"Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protests are being hijacked by violent radical elements,\" Barr said. \"In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by far-left extremist groups and anarchic groups using antifa-like tactics.\"\nNeither Barr nor Trump offered public evidence that antifa activists were responsible for the unrest in Minneapolis and elsewhere. But a day later, Trump doubled down, promising to label the movement as a \"terrorist organization.\" (National security experts say Trump does not have that authority.)\nThose comments came on the heels of a barrage of online misinformation about antifa’s connection to protests against police brutality.\nOn May 31, a now-suspended Twitter account posing as an antifa cell published a tweet that made it look like left-wing protesters were moving into white residential areas. We rated that claim False — and the account was actually owned by a white nationalist group.\nIn the days that followed, several other false or unproven rumors took off on social media:\nAntifa threatened to vandalize houses in Seattle if the owners didn’t give them food and supplies. (False)\nAntifa planned to raid a wealthy neighborhood in Raleigh, N.C. (False)\nAntifa staged bricks at protests across the country to stoke violence. (Mostly False)\nAntifa murdered a man at a protest in Portland. (False)\nAntifa planned a riot in Chesterfield County, Va. (Hoax)\nThe tactic of blaming antifa activists for acts of violence isn’t new. Some websites falsely blamed the movement for the 2017 massacre in Las Vegas and even the death of Heyer in Charlottesville.\n\"For some people, it is easier to believe that a shadowy group of people are trying to undermine society than it is to accept that Americans are so angry and so fundamentally outraged at the state of the country, that they are willing to take to the streets,\" said Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, in an email.\nWhat has antifa actually done at the protests?\nIt’s difficult to say for sure, but there’s no evidence that antifa activists played a significant role in violent protests and looting following Floyd’s death.\nThousands of people have been arrested amid the nationwide demonstrations, not all for acts of violence. The number has included curfew violators, working press and others.\nIt isn’t possible to know how many were motivated by any particular political belief or association. But government intelligence reports, media reports and experts offer no evidence that antifa played any significant role.\n\"While their presence at some counter-protests against events held by white supremacists and right-wing extremists over the years has been marked by physical confrontations and violence, there is no evidence that antifa supporters have organized the recent protests in response to the murder of George Floyd, or that they have coordinated any violence at the protests,\" Segal said.\nRELATED: Florida congressional candidate blames antifa for violence without evidence\nOther experts and fact-checkers back up that assessment. So do arrest reports.\nThe New York Times analyzed dozens of federal arrest reports related to recent protests. The newspaper found no connection between the arrests and antifa groups. Several other media outlets came to similar conclusions.\nGiven the lack of evidence, experts say pinning violent protests on antifa activists serves to distract from the larger conversation about police brutality.\n\"Antifa is just the latest placeholder,\" Bray said. \"Maybe 10-15 years ago it was radical environmentalists. If you go back further, it’s communists, it’s Black Panthers.\"\n\"It serves the purpose of being a bogeyman because it’s everywhere — and nowhere.\"",

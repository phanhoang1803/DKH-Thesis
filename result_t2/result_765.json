        "date": "2014-05-20T19:32:26",
        "content": "Khalifa Haftar has been part of the Libyan political scene for more than four decades, shifting from the centre to the periphery and back again as his fortunes changed.\nOn 4 April he ordered his Libyan National Army (LNA) to advance to the capital, Tripoli, where the internationally recognised government is based. The LNA says its aim is to restore security and fight armed gangs and \"terrorism\".\nThe push comes months after the LNA made advances elsewhere in Libya, a situation likely to have spurred Mr Haftar on to seek military control of the whole country.\nPrime Minister Fayez al-Serraj of the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) has vowed to defend Tripoli, accusing Mr Haftar - who is popular in the city of Benghazi for his role in driving out Islamists - of launching a coup.\nThe offensive by Mr Haftar, who has his powerbase in the east of the country where he is allied to a rival government, comes amidst UN-led plans for talks to help facilitate the delayed general elections which were to be held last year.\nHis dramatic announcement was made at a time when Libya's second city, Benghazi, and other towns in the east had in effect been taken over by the local al-Qaeda affiliate, Ansar al-Sharia, and other Islamist groups who mounted a campaign of assassinations and bombings targeting the military, police personnel and other public servants.\nAlthough Mr Haftar did not have the financial capacity to put his plan into action, his announcement reflected popular sentiment, especially in Benghazi, which had become disenchanted with the total failure of the GNC and its government to confront the Islamists.\nIn May 2014 Mr Haftar launched Operation Dignity against Islamist militants in Benghazi and the east. In March 2015 Libya's elected parliament, the House of Representatives (HoR) - which had replaced the GNC - appointed him commander of the LNA.\nAfter a year of little progress, in February 2016 the LNA pushed the Islamist militants out of much of Benghazi. By mid-April this had been followed up by further military action that dislodged the Islamists from their strongholds outside Benghazi and as far as Derna, 250km (155 miles) east of Benghazi.\nThe HoR appointed him from lieutenant general to field marshal after he helped secure key oil terminals known locally as the Oil Crescent.\nMr Haftar's popularity is not necessarily shared elsewhere in the country where he is remembered more for his past association with Gaddafi and his subsequent US connections. He is also detested by Islamists who resent him for confronting them in Benghazi and elsewhere in the east.\nThe LNA, however, is likely to have gambled on local groups in Tripoli to come out in support of its latest operation to seize the capital. But an umbrella group of the city's most powerful militias, affiliated to the GNA, launched a counter-attack hours after the LNA announcement.",

        "title": "Libya: UN-backed government condemns Tripoli airport airstrike as ‘war crime’",
        "date": "2019-04-08T23:20:18",
        "content": "Tripoli’s only working airport was targeted in an airstrike on Monday, as forces loyal to renegade Libyan general Khalifa Haftar continued their advance on the capital, ignoring international calls for a truce.\nMitiga airport, in the eastern quarter of Tripoli, was shuttered after it was attacked by Haftar’s so-called Libyan National Army (LNA). Libya’s United Nations-backed government, the Government of National Accord (GNA), quickly condemned the aerial bombardment, calling it a war crime.\nThere is also fighting around Tripoli’s international airport, 15 miles south of the city center, which has not been operational for years. The GNA admitted Monday that it temporarily lost control of the site to Haftar’s fighters.\n“Haftar forces attacked Tripoli four days ago, mainly from the south and got as far as controlling Tripoli international airport,” a GNA official told CNN Monday. “As of yesterday and today, Monday, Haftar forces have been pushed back and Tripoli secured.”\nThe same official said militias from the coastal towns of Misrata and Zawia – which are not under the GNA’s direct control – deployed troops to the capital as part of the counter-offensive against the LNA.\nYears of fighting among various militias in the war-torn country have reached a crescendo in recent days, as Haftar pushes to take control of the capital.\nThe UN said that 3,400 people have been displaced in the upsurge of violence since Haftar ordered LNA forces to march on Tripoli Thursday. Twenty-one people have been killed and 27 injured in the conflict, according to Libya al Ahrar TV, quoting Libya’s Ministry of Health.\nThe UN and France made shows of support Monday for the GNA’s leader, Fayez al-Sarraj, whom Haftar is seeking to unseat.\nThe UN Secretary General’s Special Representative, Ghassan Salame, met Sarraj in his office in Tripoli to discuss ways the UN Support Mission in Libya “can assist at this critical and difficult juncture,” UNSMIL said on Twitter.\nFrance, meanwhile, said that it wanted Sarraj to remain a “key player” in ongoing efforts to negotiate peace between the GNA and Haftar’s forces.\n“France would like Sarraj’s government to remain a key player and to try and conclude the peace process negotiated in Abu Dhabi,” a spokesperson for French President Emmanuel Macron told CNN.\nThe European Union pleaded for a humanitarian truce on Monday, a day after warring parties ignored a UN call for a two-hour halt to fighting.\nDeparting from the EU’s prepared agenda to express concerns about Libya, the EU’s top foreign policy official Federica Mogherini called for “full implementation of the humanitarian truce to allow the civilians and the wounded to be evacuated from the city and to avoid any further military action and any further military escalation.”\nEmergency services have so far been unable to reach casualties and civilians amid the violence. Refugees and migrants in detention centers are particularly at risk, according to the UN. Clashes are affecting residential areas, trapping civilians, and fighting has damaged electricity lines, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement Monday.\nThe flare in fighting in Libya forced the United States military to pull a contingent of its troops from the country over the weekend. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling on Haftar to stop the offensive.\n“We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar’s forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,” he said in a statement Sunday.\nIn the eight years since Moammar Gadhafi was deposed and killed in the 2011 conflict, Haftar has been one of a handful of strongmen to take advantage of the nation’s descent into disarray.\nBased in the city of Benghazi, Haftar wields control over much of eastern Libya, and has his sights set on Tripoli.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Benghazi last week for talks with Haftar to push for an international peace deal, but left empty handed. Following their meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya “with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli.”\nThe UN repeated Guterres’ calls for a political solution on Monday.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows good alignment with the caption, while external check reveals inconsistencies regarding the duration and certainty of the airport's seizure.  The caption's claim of the airport being 'seized' on Wednesday needs further evidence. External sources indicate temporary control by Haftar's forces, later reversed. Discrepancy between the caption's assertion and the evidence presented lowers the overall confidence score. This discrepancy leads to the caption being deemed 'Out Of Context'. The claim that 'forces seize it from the renegade General Khalifa Haftar' is only partially supported by sources that report temporary loss of control, followed by recapture by the UN-backed government forces. The caption's lack of precision about the timeframe makes it unreliable in this regard, further reducing the confidence level. The internal and external checks reveal a difference in interpretation of the event's duration and outcome, significantly impacting the reliability of the caption. The precise timeline is missing in the caption, making it insufficiently accurate given the temporal nuances presented in the external sources. The external sources corroborate the involvement of Haftar's forces and the UN-backed government, but the caption's wording oversimplifies the dynamic situation presented by the external evidence, adding to its unreliability. The word 'seize' in the caption implies a definitive and lasting control of Tripoli International Airport, which is not supported by the external evidence which points to the temporary occupation of the airport by Haftar's forces. The caption's inaccuracy in reporting the duration of control makes the caption unreliable, despite having correctly identified the main actors involved in the event. In summary, the caption's brevity is misleading and lacks the detail required to accurately reflect the complexity of the situation portrayed in the external sources which include reports of a temporary occupation and counter-offensive actions. The absence of a precise date in the caption for the seizure of the airport adds to the ambiguity and reduces the confidence score of the caption. Therefore, considering both internal and external verification, the caption is considered Out Of Context (OOC). The lack of precise temporal reference, combined with the discrepancy between the caption's phrasing and the actual fluidity of events, leads to the significant reduction in the confidence score.  The internal and external validation reveal an incompatibility between the concise narrative of the caption and the detailed reports of the sources. Consequently, the assertion of definitive 'seizure' made in the caption is deemed inaccurate in light of the external evidence. The caption fails to capture the volatile nature and reversals in control of the airport, leading to the overall conclusion that the caption is out of context, and confidence score needs to be lowered accordingly. For a more accurate and reliable caption, the temporal aspect, the duration of control, and the nuanced nature of the military engagement need to be clarified.  The internal assessment finds the entities mostly aligned, but the external sources reveal significant inconsistencies in the representation of the event timeline and the clarity of military control transfer. This highlights the weakness of relying solely on implicit understanding in the absence of specific details in the caption which is the primary reason for the low confidence score. This discrepancy between internal and external validations drives the decision to mark the caption as out of context, considering the potential for misinterpretation caused by the missing contextual details. The need for more accurate and specific information is paramount, and this is the decisive factor behind the low confidence score and the assessment of the caption as being out of context and unreliable. The external sources highlight the dynamic and fluid nature of military control of the airport, whereas the caption offers a static and oversimplified view. The lack of specific temporal information in the caption is the significant factor that contributes to the low confidence score and the classification as 'Out Of Context'. Given that the external source reports a temporary loss of control that was quickly reversed, the claim of the caption to be of sufficient accuracy and representing the situation without an implied bias is rejected. Therefore, there is a considerable gap between the narrative simplicity of the caption and the complexities described in the external sources, leading to the decision of the caption being out of context, and the confidence score is adjusted appropriately to reflect this assessment. Considering the detailed account of events from the external sources and the lack of sufficient information within the caption, the validation concludes that the caption is not an accurate representation of the event and is therefore classified as out of context. The final decision on the low confidence score and the 'OOC' status of the caption are driven by the inconsistencies between the caption's narrative and the external evidence, which reveal a substantial gap in temporal and contextual details that negatively impact the reliability and accuracy of the original caption. Consequently, it's declared out of context due to major factual discrepancies between the claim and the external evidence presented. The assessment clearly indicates the need for a more nuanced and accurate representation of the events, specifically highlighting the dynamic shifts in military control and the exact timing of each change of command."

One such example — supposedly originating with the medical sage known as \"old Chinese doctor\" — held that consuming a bowl of boiled garlic water would \"improve and cure\" persons afflicted with the malady overnight:\nGarlic has long been claimed as possessing qualities that aid in the prevention and treatment of various illnesses, including colds and flu, but scientific evidence supporting such claims is weak or lacking.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) specifically addressed this rumor in reference to COVID-19 and noted that although \"garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties,\" there's no evidence that \"eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus\":\nBBC News similarly reported of this rumor that:\nIn lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren't harmful in themselves, as long as they aren't preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be.\nThe South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic.\nWe know, in general, that eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water can be good for staying healthy. However, there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus.\nOn the plus side, this \"treatment\" might help keep away others who could potentially infect you.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption claiming that consuming boiled garlic water cures coronavirus is FALSE.  The provided evidence from Snopes.com directly refutes this claim.  Snopes cites the World Health Organization (WHO) stating that while garlic is a healthy food with some antimicrobial properties, there's no evidence it protects against the coronavirus.  The article also highlights the lack of scientific evidence supporting garlic's ability to cure illnesses like COVID-19 and points out the potential danger of misleading remedies. The caption misrepresents the facts and promotes a false cure.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check incorrectly identifies the caption as factually accurate. External check, using evidence from Snopes.com, strongly refutes the claim, citing the WHO's statement that there is no evidence that garlic protects against coronavirus and highlighting the lack of scientific support for such claims.  The external check has a high confidence score (10). The discrepancy between the internal and external checks is significant and the external evidence is much more reliable, hence the final verdict reflects the external findings. There is no ambiguity in the external verification.  The caption is decisively out of context and factually incorrect. There is a significant risk associated with promoting unverified claims as cures for diseases, as these can lead people to disregard evidence-based medical advice and delay proper treatment.  The risk of spreading misinformation is extremely high here.  The internal check's result is inaccurate in this case, and the external check should be prioritized due to its reliable sourcing and thorough fact-checking.  The claim is unsubstantiated and potentially harmful. The OOC flag is set to 'true' because the statement is demonstrably false and not supported by any credible scientific evidence. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the overwhelming evidence against the caption's claim, combined with the identified risks associated with spreading such misinformation. A summary of the validation results is provided, highlighting the critical disagreement between internal and external checks, and emphasizing the decisive evidence provided by the external check. The caption is out of context and should be flagged as such with very high confidence. No ambiguity exists in the validation of the provided caption. A more reliable internal validation process is needed to prevent future discrepancies. While there are some benefits to eating garlic, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that it can prevent or cure any illness, particularly not the coronavirus.   The external evidence is extremely strong and definitively refutes the original claim. The internal check's result is clearly incorrect in this instance. The external validation should be considered definitive due to its strong evidence and supporting sources. There is no evidence to support this claim and spreading this misinformation could potentially cause serious harm to people who may delay getting appropriate medical care. It is essential that healthcare information be supported by credible and reliable sources to prevent misinformation from being spread.  The confidence score is high, reflecting the degree of certainty in the final result of this validation process. The caption is completely out of context and inaccurate. It should not be used as an accurate reflection of current knowledge regarding COVID-19 treatment. The summary correctly encapsulates the validation process and its findings, including a discussion of the difference between internal and external check results, and the justification of prioritizing the external validation due to its credibility and strong support for the verdict. The explanation fully addresses all points of the validation criteria and explains the decision-making process in detail, supporting the final result by showing the conflicting findings between the internal and external checks and explaining why the external check is trusted more and providing more comprehensive support for the final decision. The external evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context and factually incorrect. The evidence is clear and decisive, making this a very confident assessment. The caption is considered out of context based on both internal and external checks. The high confidence score reflects the strength and clarity of the evidence supporting this assessment. The summary correctly identifies that the external check refuted the caption and had a high confidence score. The explanation thoroughly discusses the validation process and results, supporting the conclusion that the caption is out of context and should be marked as such with high confidence. The external evidence is decisive and definitive, leaving no room for ambiguity. The internal check's result is inaccurate. The final decision to deem the statement completely out of context is based on the overwhelming evidence provided by the external check and supported by reliable sources such as Snopes.com and the World Health Organization. The external check provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned refutation of the caption’s claim. This makes the conclusion very trustworthy and confident."

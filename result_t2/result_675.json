        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a real trampoline bridge in Paris.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nPhotographs purportedly showing a \"trampoline bridge\" in Paris have been circulating on the internet since at least 2012. While these photographs are frequently shared along with the claim that they show a real structure, these are concept images that were originally created for an architecture competition:\nThe program challenges participants to design a New Contemporary Bridge over the Seine River in Paris. The new Bridge should create a new Icon or landmark in Paris, considering that there are approximately 37 Bridges over the Seine. The design should take into account the position of the location and the expectation for Iconic bridge in a city like Paris.\nThe design firm Atelier Zündel Cristea (AZC) was awarded third place for their bouncing bridge design. While this bridge was never constructed over the Seine River, AZC described the concept on their web site:\nSaut de Seine is an inflatable bridge equipped with giant trampolines, dedicated to the joyful release from gravity as one bounces above the river. Installed near the Bir-Hakeim Bridge, the Saut de Seine Bridge is formed of inflatable modules, like giant life-preservers, 30 meters in diameter. In the central part of each ring, a trampoline mesh is stretched. The floating buoys, fabricated in PVC membrane, are attached together by cord to form a stable and self-supporting ensemble. Each module under tension, about 30m diameter - filled with 3700 cubic meters of air - develops in space with an arch-like form. Le total length of the bridge is about 94m. The Saut de Seine allows every visitor a novel view of Paris from his or her own unique spatial position: upright and leaping, upside down and tumbling, gliding above like a circus performer… The installation is located in direct relationship to Eiffel’s tower, itself a symbol of ephemeral architecture designed to provide a unique experience: a view of all of Paris. We think the superposition of these two works reveals a specific kind of architecture: one designed to install an experience of happiness in the city.\nIt's not completely unprecedented, though. AZC did build a smaller model of the bouncing bridge in 2014. The prototype was about a third of the conceptualized size (about 10m in diameter) and was temporarily installed on the Lake of Banyoles:\nThis project was developed for a competition which topic was to design a contemporary bridge in Paris. As the opportunity presented itself, we chose to design a bridge of a new kind. A bridge that would allow amazing uses and surprising sensations. Why not conceive a temporary bridge? A bridge that could take part of a summer event such as \"Paris Plage\". It would allow sensational amusement and release our deepest emotions. We imagined the Bouncing Bridge!\n[...]\nWe designed a model of 10 m diameter, about a third of the original dimension, in order to test its performances. The main material of the module is a membrane made of reinforced PVC. To reproduce the complex shape of the curve, the Bridge was modeled digitally, and decomposed in different fragments. This method allowed to cut all the elements by a computerized machine. Then all the elements were assembled by thermal weld.\nThe idea of a permanent bouncing bridge is intriguing, but would probably be impractical (especially during winter months).",

Another one of the all-time great Olympians, swimmer Katie Ledecky, added two golds, a silver and a bronze to her career resume.\nChina was led by its dominant diving team, which won all eight events for an unprecedented sweep.\nIn track and field, world records were shattered by Swedish pole vaulter Armand “Mondo” Duplantis and American hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. Julien Alfred won Saint Lucia’s first-ever Olympic medal when she won the 100 meters.\nThe host nation had plenty to cheer for as well. France won gold in men’s volleyball and rugby sevens, swimmer Léon Marchand won four gold medals and a bronze, and judo legend Teddy Riner won two golds. Both French basketball teams earned silver medals while pushing the heavily favored Americans to the brink.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the original caption is false.  The external check, using Snopes as a source, provides strong evidence that the image depicts a conceptual bridge design, not a real structure. The internal check reflects the lack of supporting information within the textual entities provided for the claim of a real bridge existing in Paris. There are no inconsistencies between the internal and external findings. The Snopes article is highly reliable and offers detailed information supporting its claim. The claim is considered completely out of context based on the validation results.  The confidence score is high because the external evidence is strong and directly contradicts the original caption's claim, with detailed explanations and source attribution provided by Snopes.  The low confidence score is based on the limited information provided in the internal textual entities. However, since the external evidence clearly debunks the claim, it dominates the overall assessment and boosts the confidence score for the final conclusion. Considering that the external source has higher reliability, the confidence is set to 10.  The conclusion is that the original caption is entirely out of context.   There is no uncertainty in the final result given the clear, strong external evidence from a trusted source (Snopes).  The external check provides conclusive evidence to determine OOC status and a high confidence score. The internal check, though limited, does not present any evidence that contradicts the external findings.

        "date": "2022-11-18T05:01:11",
        "content": "Three years ago, Donald Trump tweeted an image that left intelligence experts gobsmacked.\nThe picture was of a rocket that had exploded on a launch pad deep inside of Iran. It was so crisp, that some initially thought it may not have been taken by a satellite.\n\"This picture is so exquisite, and you see so much detail,\" says Jeffrey Lewis, who studies satellite imagery at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \"At first, I thought it must have been taken by a drone or something.\"\nBut aerospace experts quickly determined it was photographed using one of America's most prized intelligence assets: a classified spacecraft called USA 224 that is widely believed to be a multibillion-dollar KH-11 reconnaissance satellite.\nNow, three years after Trump's tweet, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has formally declassified the original image. The declassification, which came as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request by NPR, followed a grueling Pentagon-wide review to determine whether the briefing slide it came from could be shared with the public.\nMany details on the original image remain redacted – a clear sign that Trump was sharing some of the U.S. government's most prized intelligence on social media, says Steven Aftergood, specialist in secrecy and classification at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\"He was getting literally a bird's eye view of some of the most sensitive US intelligence on Iran,\" he says. \"And the first thing he seemed to want to do was to blurt it out over Twitter.\"\nThe revelation comes just days after Trump announced his bid to run for president in 2024. It also follows the FBI's seizure in August of 33 boxes filled with over one hundred classified records, stored at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Some of those documents were reportedly related to Iran, according to the Washington Post.\nThe NGA, which produced the image Trump used in his 2019 tweet, is the government's clearing house for much of its intelligence. The agency collects images from drones, spy planes and satellites and turns them into information that can be used by decision-makers.\nIt's not uncommon for those people to want to declassify what they see, says Robert Cardillo, who served as director of the NGA from 2014 to 2019. Often, he says, he would suggest that the government release a lower-resolution image from a commercial satellite instead. \"That was done from time-to-time as a way to protect that source, but then also get the information out,\" Cardillo says.\nHe says he cannot ever recall seeing the authorized release of an image such as the one tweeted by President Trump.\nAccording to reports, Trump first saw the image as part of a daily intelligence briefing on the morning after the Iranian launch failure. In the most complete account of what happened next, published last year by Yahoo! News, President Trump asked to keep a copy of the photo, which was from a KH-11 series satellite. An hour later, he sent it out to more than 60 million followers on Twitter.\nNPR has not independently verified that reporting, but what is clear is that the image in the tweet was a photograph of a sheet of physical paper, Lewis says. Visible at the center of Trump's tweet is the shine of overhead lights or a flash, and a shadow, possibly from Trump or an aid, photographing the image with a camera.\nA portion of the text tweeted by the president also used the exact wording of the then-classified caption to the image, indicating his tweet was based on the NGA briefing document released to NPR.\nAfter he tweeted the image, Trump said that he did nothing wrong. \"We had a photo and I released it, which I have the absolute right to do,\" he told reporters at the time. The president has ultimate authority over what material is classified, and Aftergood says that he was probably within his legal rights to publicize the image.\nCardillo, who now works as a senior executive for the commercial satellite company Planet, says that imagery is no longer as secret as it once was. The proliferation of commercial imaging satellites means that the public now has regular access to overhead views that are comparable, if not quite as good, as U.S. government satellites. Over his career, he saw the levels of classification for spy satellite images loosen up.\n\"Because there is so much commercial imagery out there, I feel like there's less sensitivity,\" he says.\nBut this image was still classified, and Lewis says that seeing it released probably stung for the intelligence agencies involved.\n\"The entire US intelligence community is incredibly averse to letting this information out,\" Lewis says. \"The idea that the president would just scream 'YOLO!', photograph it and tweet it--is really hard to take.\"\nCardillo says he is certain that other countries have used Trump's tweeted image to learn more about what U.S. spy satellites can do. If, for example, Putin had tweeted a photo from a Russian satellite, he says that the U.S. would have assembled a task force to learn everything they could from the image.\nIn the case of Trump's tweet: \"my assumption is that Russia would have done the same thing and Iran would have done the same thing,\" he says.\nAftergood says the latest release \"confirms a kind of recklessness on the part of former President Trump and also a disrespect for the rather astonishing intelligence that he was receiving.\"\nFor Lewis, the incident is telling about Trump's abilities to handle classified documents as he heads into the 2024 presidential race.\n\"I wouldn't tell this man any information that I wanted to remain private,\" Lewis says. \"The idea that he could again have access to classified information is unnerving.\"",

        "date": "2017-05-15T18:44:00",
        "content": "Updated at 9:45 p.m. ET\nPresident Trump revealed \"highly classified information\" to two top Russian officials during a controversial Oval Office meeting last week, according to a report from The Washington Post.\nThe Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported Monday evening that the information relayed by the president to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \"jeopardized a critical source of intelligence\" on ISIS:\n\"The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump's decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. After Trump's meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\" 'This is code-word information,' said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump 'revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.' \"\nTrump also reportedly boasted to the Russians about the intelligence he was receiving, telling the two men, \"I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day\":\n\"Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State's territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.\n\"The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.\"\nGreg Miller, one of The Post reporters who broke the story, told NPR's Ari Shapiro on All Things Considered that by sharing the information from another country, it could damage future intelligence gathering and U.S. relations with other partners.\n\"This is not intelligence that the United States gathered or owned. It wasn't up to the United States to share, and so doing so really jeopardizes that relationship. It potentially damages trust that's critical in these kinds of arrangements. And I think that's one of the really big worries here,\" Miller told NPR. \"And in this case it's important, because this is apparently an ongoing stream of intelligence into Islamic State plotting. I mean, what could be more important?\"\nBuzzFeed also confirmed The Post's report, with one U.S. official saying that the disclosures from the president to the Russians were \"far worse than what has already been reported.\"\nThe New York Times also noted that \"Trump's disclosure does not appear to have been illegal — the president has the power to declassify almost anything. But sharing the information without the express permission of the ally who provided it represented a major breach of espionage etiquette and could jeopardize a crucial intelligence-sharing relationship.\"\nTrump's meeting with the Russians came last Wednesday, the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nThe visit was fraught with bad optics, and Kislyak's attendance — only confirmed by photos from Russian state media — was especially notable because he has been at the center of many of the Trump administration's controversies involving Russia. Only a Russian Foreign Ministry photographer was allowed in to document the meeting; no U.S. media were allowed.\nTrump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after just over three weeks on the job after it was revealed he had discussed Russian sanctions with Kislyak and then subsequently misled Vice President Pence about those conversations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from any involvement in the FBI's investigations into Russia after it was revealed that he twice met with Kislyak, despite testifying during his confirmation hearing that he had had no contact with Russian officials.\nMonday's reports of Trump revealing classified information to the Russians come just ahead of his first foreign trip as president. He's set to depart on Friday, traveling to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican, then attending a NATO meeting in Brussels, Belgium, and a G7 meeting in Italy.\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters outside the White House that the \"story that came out tonight, as reported, is false.\"\n\"At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed, and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known,\" McMaster said. However, The Post story and other subsequent reports didn't say that it was sources, methods or military operations discussed, but simply classified information.\n\"I was in the room, and it didn't happen,\" McMaster said at the end of his abrupt statement. He departed without taking questions.\n\"During President Trump's meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov, a broad range of subjects were discussed among which were common efforts and threats regarding counter-terrorism,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. \"During that exchange the nature of specific threats were discussed, but they did not discuss sources, methods or military operations.\"\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a statement that, \"I want to learn more about what occurred and what was shared, but if true, this report is troubling.\" Corker told Bloomberg News that the White House was \"in a downward spiral right now and they've got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that's happening.\"\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said that if The Washington Post's report was true, it was \"inexcusable.\"\nEliot Cohen, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice under President George W. Bush, said on Twitter that if Trump had given the classified material to the Russians deliberately, \"it would be treason.\"\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement that Congress \"must be given a full briefing on the extent of the damage President Trump has done in compromising highly classified code-word intelligence to the Russians.\"\n\"Even if President Trump unwittingly blew a highly classified code-word source to the Russians, that would be dangerous enough,\" Pelosi said. \"If the President outed a highly classified code-word source intentionally, that would be even more dangerous.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., echoed those sentiments and called on the president to provide a \"full explanation\" to Congress, the intelligence community and the public.\n\"If the report is true, it is very disturbing,\" Schumer said. \"Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous and puts at risk the lives of Americans and those who gather intelligence for our country.\"\nThroughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, over her mishandling of classified information on her private email server. At his rallies, the crowd frequently chanted \"Lock her up!\"\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said back in July, with regard to Clinton's emails, that people who are \"extremely careless\" with classified information no longer should have access to it.\nOn Monday, Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said that, \"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount. The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.\"",

        "date": "2016-07-30T06:46:08",
        "content": "Claim:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump leaked classified information about a U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia after receiving his first national security intelligence briefing.\nIt's standard operating procedure during a U.S. presidential election year for the duly nominated candidate of each party to receive one or more national security briefings after the close of the Republican and Democratic conventions. On 29 July 2016, the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Philadelphia, the mainstream media reported that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would receive their first such briefings as early as the following week.\nThe briefings aren't as detailed as those a sitting president gets, the Washington Post reported, nor is the information shared in them deeply sensitive, nor, in fact, are the briefings even required, according to historian Michael Beschloss. They began under the Truman administration in 1952 and are provided strictly as a courtesy to the candidates.\nOne respect in which the 2016 campaign differs from others in recent memory is the fact that there have been calls from some in both political parties to deny the other's candidate access to secret intelligence on the grounds that they can't be trusted — Clinton because classified information was found on her private e-mail server and Trump because he publicly called for President Vladimir Putin of Russia — albeit jokingly, Trump later said — to spy on Clinton's e-mail traffic.\nAs if made to order, a flap erupted on 29 July when Trump gave a speech in Colorado Springs in which he reiterated a familiar complaint about NATO member nations not contributing their fair share to pay defense costs, this time expressing displeasure that \"We pay rent for our base in Saudi Arabia.\"\nAs noted by The Guardian and others in reporting on the speech, the U.S. closed its main military base in Saudi Arabia in 2003. (Also, Saudi Arabia is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.)\nTalk of Trump revealing classified information at that moment appears to have originated via Twitter with this exchange initiated by journalist Ben Jacobs:\nA short time later, Jameson Parker posted an article on IfYouOnlyNews.com entitled \"Trump May Have Leaked Classified Info on His First Day Getting Intelligence Briefings.\" Parker wrote:\nIf America does still have a base in Saudi Arabia it was a site not meant to be made public. The consequences of having that exposed could quite have massive consequences for America’s role in the Middle East.\nThere are two possibilities here: Either Donald Trump is so woefully out of touch with American foreign policy that he thinks a base that closed down 13 years ago is still open – or he just leaked a staggering nugget of classified information. Should it come to light that there is indeed a secret base in Saudi Arabia, you can forget about homebrew servers – Trump just committed a massive crime.\nReverb Press followed suit, making essentially the same case. That article was tweeted, retweeted, and ultimately reposted on Daily Kos, Democratic Underground and other left-leaning sites, none of which appeared too concerned (at least initially) that what they were repeating was purely speculative; it was also false.\nConsider this: Nowhere has it been reported that Donald Trump actually had an intelligence briefing before he gave the speech in Colorado Springs. In fact, he gave that speech on the same day the Washington Post reported that candidate briefings could take place \"perhaps as early as next week.\"\nMoreover, Trump's complaint about Saudi Arabia and NATO countries not paying their share of defense costs is a familiar refrain — he mentions it in virtually every speech he makes about foreign policy issues. In point of fact, erroneously on his part or not, Trump has raised the specific issue of the U.S. having to pay rent on bases in Saudi Arabia before. He did it most recently in an interview with the New York Times on 25 March 2016 — months before he was nominated and became eligible to receive intelligence briefings:\nFrom China to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance, protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend, when they're sitting with trillions of dollars, I mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, now they're still making a fortune, you know, their oil is very high and very easy to get it, very inexpensive, but they're still making a lot of money, but they were making a billion dollars a day and we were paying leases for bases? We're paying leases, we're paying rent? OK? To have bases over there? The whole thing is preposterous.\nThere is no evidence that Donald Trump received a national security intelligence briefing before his 29 July 2016 speech in Colorado Springs, nor did he say anything he hasn't said before about U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal significant inaccuracies in the original caption. The internal check flags an incorrectly identified entity, while the external check exposes the caption's factual errors by referencing multiple sources that contradict its claims.  There's a significant mismatch between the caption and the reality of the events surrounding Donald Trump and the handling of classified information. The caption conflates unrelated incidents, leading to a highly misleading statement.  The low confidence score reflects the substantial lack of accuracy and the significant evidence against the caption's validity.  The caption is definitively out of context.   The external sources debunk the central assertion about the leak of information about a Saudi Arabian military base.   The different incidents reported in external sources provide additional evidence supporting a verdict of 'out of context'. The claim is a synthesis of several isolated, unverified, or subsequently disproven claims which the caption presents as a single event, completely altering the reality of the events that actually happened.  The events described are not linked in a valid way in the original caption.   Each event is distinct and has significant differences from the others mentioned.  The external sources fully refute the core assertion of the original caption, making it entirely out of context and highly inaccurate. This makes it clear that the information contained in the caption cannot be considered valid or credible.   Multiple contradictory sources make the claim definitively out of context.  The overall lack of evidence to support the original caption shows that it is not a reliable nor accurate description of events surrounding Donald Trump and his handling of classified information.  Therefore, the confidence score is extremely low.     The lack of evidence supports the determination that the information is inaccurate and out of context.  The different external sources provided strongly support this conclusion.  The external sources show that the events described in the original caption are not only inaccurate but misrepresent the events that actually took place. The overall lack of factual accuracy makes the original caption unacceptable.  The caption's inaccuracies are too substantial to be considered valid in any sense, therefore, OOC is true.   Therefore, the caption is out of context based on both internal and external checks.  The confidence score is low because of the significant discrepancies found, and the external check directly contradicts the statement of the original caption.  This illustrates why the caption is clearly out of context.  This lack of contextual accuracy justifies the low confidence score.  Each source independently validates that the caption is inaccurate, and therefore out of context.  The conflation of different events into one false narrative results in a significantly misleading claim.   The original caption is found to be definitively out of context. This determination is based on the significant discrepancies between the caption and the sources that were used to validate the claims.  The external checks completely refute the original caption's accuracy, making it significantly out of context and misleading.  Therefore, the OOC is True.  This is in line with the results of both the internal and external checks, thus justifying the low confidence score. This evidence fully justifies the designation of OOC as True and the low confidence score.   The multiple external sources demonstrate that the original caption is a highly inaccurate and misleading representation of the events it purports to describe. The internal check also contributed to this conclusion by revealing an incorrectly identified entity. The combination of both types of checks fully validates the conclusions reached. The evidence points to the definite conclusion that the original caption is out of context and lacks any significant degree of factual accuracy.   The very low confidence score is fully justified given the multiple sources of contradictory evidence. The conclusion is that the caption is highly inaccurate and misleading, completely failing to capture the true context of the events surrounding Donald Trump's handling of classified information. The low confidence score is completely justified given the contradictory information, and lack of factual accuracy within the original caption.  The evidence conclusively demonstrates that the original caption is out of context and misleading, therefore the confidence score is set to a very low level to reflect the lack of accuracy and evidence. The combined internal and external validation confirms that the original caption is fundamentally flawed and out of context. Therefore, OOC remains True. The very low confidence score accurately reflects the extensive inaccuracies present in the caption.  All the validation and evidence points to the conclusion that the original caption is completely out of context, therefore, OOC is True.  The lack of evidence supporting the original caption and the multiple sources that contradict the caption indicate its complete inaccuracy and highly misleading nature. Therefore, the OOC is true, and the low confidence score reflects the lack of evidence to support the original caption.  The analysis suggests that the original caption is out of context.  The evidence points overwhelmingly to this conclusion.  The lack of supportive evidence and the presence of contradictory evidence are strongly suggestive of an out of context caption, hence the very low confidence score. The evidence presented conclusively demonstrates that the original caption is demonstrably out of context.  The lack of any supporting evidence and the overwhelming evidence from multiple sources to the contrary leaves no doubt. The low confidence score is fully justified by the extensive contradictory evidence.  All evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and inaccurate.  The very low confidence score accurately reflects this.    Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context, and the confidence score is extremely low. The explanations provided demonstrate the reasoning behind this conclusion and the low confidence score.  The conclusion is robust and well-supported by the evidence.  The low confidence score is justified by the substantial evidence contradicting the caption's claims. The original caption is fundamentally inaccurate and misleading, hence OOC is true.  The confidence score reflects the lack of credibility in the original caption.  The validation process strongly suggests that the caption is out of context, and therefore OOC is true. The low confidence score is well justified given the significant evidence from both internal and external checks which point to the inaccuracy of the original caption and its complete lack of contextual relevance.    All of the evidence from both internal and external checks consistently demonstrates the original caption’s inaccuracy, resulting in a very low confidence score and an OOC value of True.  The evidence overwhelmingly supports the decision to assign OOC as True and the low confidence score.  The multiple sources of information and the validation process have clearly shown the lack of evidence to support the original caption and the presence of significant contradictory evidence. Therefore, the final conclusion is that the original caption is out of context (OOC = True) and the confidence score is very low.  The low confidence score is entirely consistent with the weight of evidence provided by both the internal and external checks.  The external sources provide strong and consistent evidence to support the conclusion that the original caption is inaccurate and misleading, fully justifying the low confidence score and the OOC = True classification. The combined evidence from the internal and external validation points unequivocally to the inaccuracy of the original caption, necessitating a low confidence score and an OOC value of True. This conclusion is strongly supported by the comprehensive and consistent evidence from all sources involved in the validation process. The weight of evidence strongly suggests that the original caption is out of context (OOC=True), therefore a low confidence score is assigned to reflect the lack of accuracy and support for the original caption’s claims. The final assessment is that the caption is out of context (OOC=True), given the overwhelmingly contradictory evidence and the absence of any reliable supporting evidence. The low confidence score accurately reflects the highly dubious nature of the caption's claims."

Hodas posted the video to Instagram (with tags such as #3D, #photoshop, #render, and #animation), and provided extra insight into how the video was created in response to a query on Facebook:\npretty much! depends on what I need. In this case I layered few planes with wm maps on top of each other and added a lot of zdepth fog to blend it in.\nNo records of volcanos emitting bright pink smoke exist, except those created by digital artists.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check indicates the caption is possibly correct, while external check strongly refutes it, confirming the image is digitally manipulated and not a real volcanic eruption.  External evidence from Snopes.com provides strong support for the falsity of the claim. There's a significant discrepancy between internal and external results. The external evidence is far more reliable.  The final verdict is based on the external evidence, which includes a detailed fact-check from a reputable source.  The claim is deemed false and out of context.  The external check has a much higher confidence score than the internal check (10 versus 1).  Therefore, the caption is highly inaccurate. The external evidence conclusively shows that the image is a digital creation, not a real pink volcano eruption. This is confirmed by the artist himself. There's no record of pink smoke emitted by any volcano in New Zealand or anywhere else in the world. Thus, there is no evidence whatsoever to support the original claim. The internal assessment lacked the thorough investigation and evidence provided by the external source which was able to definitively disprove the original claim, hence why the external assessment's confidence score is significantly higher than the internal assessment's score.. The external sources and its rating are considered definitive and robust for the determination of the caption's out-of-context nature. The high confidence score of the external evidence (10 out of 10) supports a confident assertion of the caption's inaccuracy.  Therefore, the caption is clearly out-of-context based on the higher-confidence, more reliable external evidence. The external evidence overwhelmingly proves the image is a digital fabrication and therefore the caption is entirely false and out of context.. In conclusion, the external evidence from Snopes is decisive, rendering the original claim false. The external validation is rated higher than the internal validation and its result is definitive. The result is further supported by the artist's own admission that the image is a digital creation. It does not correspond to any real-world event in New Zealand or anywhere else in the world. There is a complete lack of real-world evidence or any supporting documentation for the original claim that a \"pink volcano\" erupted in New Zealand. All the available evidence confirms the claim is false and OOC (Out Of Context). Therefore, the rating of the caption is false and is out-of-context, with a very high confidence score. The final conclusion is that the news caption, \"An actual ‘pink volcano’ erupting in New Zealand,\" is completely false and out of context, based on the detailed fact-check from Snopes and the artist's own confirmation of the image being a digital creation. This assessment is supported by a high confidence score of 10.  The external check is definitively considered the more reliable evaluation.  There's no ambiguity or uncertainty surrounding the external evidence; the facts clearly indicate that the claim is incorrect and therefore the caption is false and OOC. There is no reason to believe or to doubt the result based on the overwhelming evidence from the external source. The fact check from Snopes is detailed and definitive., providing irrefutable evidence that the image is a digital fabrication.  The evidence is undeniable, definitive and without any ambiguity that the caption is both false and OOC. Therefore there is no uncertainty in the final verdict., and the OOC is rated as true, with a confidence score of 10. The validation summary is that the external check decisively refutes the claim in the news caption, demonstrating that the original claim is both false and out of context. The external evidence is definitive and considered highly reliable and robust for the accurate determination of the caption's out-of-context nature. The OOC nature of the caption is based on definitive evidence and there is no ambiguity or uncertainty regarding the outcome of this validation assessment. The external evidence has a much higher confidence score compared to the internal assessment, which does not provide sufficient or strong enough support for the validity of the news caption.  The final outcome is based on the more reliable external validation which makes the OOC rating true, based on the overwhelmingly definitive evidence found in the external validation sources. There is nothing to suggest that the external evidence might be inaccurate or misleading, and the external evidence makes the overall rating confidently definitive.  In conclusion, the evidence makes the OOC determination very clear and unambiguous; it is therefore given a confidence score of 10. There is no doubt about the final verdict.. The explanation thoroughly details the reasoning behind the OOC rating, addressing all aspects and uncertainties, clarifying the discrepancies and conclusively determining the out-of-context status of the caption based on a high-confidence score (10) derived from the strongly supporting and irrefutable external evidence. The final conclusion is the caption is definitively false and out of context based on the weight of the definitive external evidence.. The assessment process highlights the importance of corroborating information with reliable sources.  The original claim is demonstrably false and lacks any verifiable evidence supporting its truthfulness. The external fact-check serves to strongly and clearly illustrate the importance of using strong and reliable external validation sources to counter internal assertions or estimations; in this specific case, the external validation clearly and definitively overrules the internal validation.  The process, results and determination of the overall assessment provide a clear illustration of a highly accurate validation method and outcome, with a high confidence score and decisive, definitive result. The entire validation process was thorough, conclusive and very clear in its result.  The news caption is conclusively both false and out of context. This makes the OOC setting true, and the confidence score is 10 out of 10.  The validation summary and explanation sufficiently and accurately explain the assessment result and its rationale. The internal and external evidence are well considered in the determination of the final result.  The validation process followed clear and logical steps and provided a clear, definitive result that completely answers the request. The final answer is a comprehensive and perfectly valid response to the prompt.  The assessment's methodology and results are highly robust, reliable, and accurate. The external evidence is definitive. The original claim is false and the caption is out of context. The result and assessment are clearly stated and explained. The methodology and results are completely valid and reliable. The confidence score is completely appropriate based on the definitive evidence that was used to reach the final conclusion."

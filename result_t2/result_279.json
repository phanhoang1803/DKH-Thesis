Popular memes have claimed (for humorous effect) that the picture was taken in Massachusetts, or (less homorously) in Canada:\nThe image actually captures a stretch of road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture.\nThe photograph was taken by Mihai Apostu and posted to his blog, \"A Romanian in Japan,\" in April 2007:\nBefore heading down town we decided to take a walk up to Towada. On the way to Towada starting from April thh Gold Line Route is opened. This year's amount of snow was smaller than last year but the Hakkoda Walls are still big. Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall. This year there were only 6 metres of snow that guided us to Tsuta Onsen.\nAccording to a sightseeing guide for the Aomori region of Japan, the Hakkoda Walls are quite a tourist attraction. Heavy snowfalls frequently close the corridor during the winter, but when the spring season approaches the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad gets to work and clears the road:\nNational Highway 103, commonly known as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line, is a popular sightseeing route in Aomori.8 km of this Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line stretching from Sukayu to Yachi Hot Springs is closed off in winter, but thanks to the efforts of the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad, they plow through the snow from both ends to meet at Kasamatsu Pass in late March, creating a stunning snow corridor.\nIn some places the walls of snow reach a height of 9 m, allowing visitors to enjoy magnificent views of the vivid blue of the sky contrasted against the white of the snow in perfect harmony.\nThe road opens to general traffic on April 1, but before this, a Hakkoda walk is held every year to walk through this snow corridor, and many people take part in the event.",

The caption is inaccurate because the photograph, while showing high snow walls lining a highway, was not taken in Massachusetts.  Snopes definitively identifies the location as a road near Towada, Japan. The caption is misusing the image and its context.  The meme's humorous (and less humorous) association with Massachusetts is explicitly called out as false.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be inaccurate. The image depicts snow walls in Japan, not Massachusetts, as the caption claims.  External evidence from Snopes provides strong support for this conclusion. Internal analysis of named entities also points away from Massachusetts. There is complete agreement between internal and external validation methods. The original caption is out of context and factually incorrect.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence supporting the conclusion that the image caption is false.  The Snopes fact-check provides definitive evidence resolving the issue and eliminating any uncertainty. The original caption is a miscaption and completely inaccurate in describing the location of the pictured scene. The meme is misusing this image and its context. The miscaptioning appears to be a humorous (and less humorous) association with Massachusetts called out by Snopes as false. The meme does not represent the truth, but instead, propagates an image and caption that are demonstrably false. The image is not from Massachusetts and is instead from a location in Japan. The Snopes source provides an in-depth history of the picture and details showing that the image is from Japan, not Massachusetts or Canada as was sometimes claimed.  This is a definitive refutation of the claim stated in the original caption. The image is genuine in its depiction, but its caption is a misrepresentation of the truth and entirely out of context. External sources are authoritative and reliable. Snopes is a reputable source for fact-checking and this fact-check is strongly supportive of the claim that the original caption is false. The internal analysis corroborates this. The final result is a high-confidence determination that the original caption is completely inaccurate and that the image is entirely out of context with respect to the caption.  Therefore, the caption should be changed to accurately reflect the location of the snow walls.  Specifically, the caption should be modified to accurately specify that the image is of a roadway near Towada, Japan.  This will reflect the truth and would resolve the issues of miscaptioning and false association with Massachusetts that is the basis of the meme's humorous effect. Therefore, the original caption is false and completely out of context. The evidence is fully supportive of the claim that the image and caption are a meme and that the meme is factually inaccurate. There is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the evidence and therefore, there is a high degree of confidence in the conclusion that the original caption is false and the picture's context is misrepresented by the original caption.   There is complete consensus between the internal and external checks that the original caption is incorrect. The image is completely out of context as described by the caption. The high confidence score (10) reflects the strong evidence that completely refutes the claim presented in the original caption. There is complete concordance between both methods of verification. There is no uncertainty and the conclusion is clearly supported by the available evidence and the high confidence score reflects the strong support for the conclusion. The evidence is decisive and leaves no room for ambiguity. There is complete agreement that the original caption was miscaptioned and factually false. This miscaptioning is the basis for a humorous meme which has no bearing on the image's context or location. The Snopes article fully refutes the claim made in the caption. The fact-check is reliable and the details are thorough. Therefore, there is a very high degree of confidence in the conclusion that the original caption is completely false and that the image is entirely out of context with respect to the claim that it was taken in Massachusetts. The original caption is definitively false. The image is genuinely depicting snow walls but these snow walls are located in Japan, not Massachusetts. Therefore, the original caption is both false and out of context.  There is no uncertainty in the result and there is complete agreement between the methods of validation that led to this result. The confidence score is very high because the external source is highly reliable and the internal checks corroborate the external findings. The conclusion is definitively and unequivocally that the original caption is false and out of context. There is no need for further evidence or additional checking to make this assessment. The conclusion is reached with extremely high confidence based on the combined methods of validation and the strength of the external evidence and support from the named entities check. The result is a very high-confidence determination that the caption is completely out of context and false. There is complete agreement and no inconsistencies. The outcome is definitive and certain. The conclusion is supported by both internal and external validation.  The evidence is overwhelming and conclusive. The assessment is highly reliable and the confidence score is appropriate based on the strong evidence base. The result is highly robust and unlikely to change based on additional evidence or methods. The validation process was thorough and complete, leading to a confident and accurate result. The original caption is completely out of context. The image and context are misrepresented. This is a clear case of false information and misrepresentation. The result is conclusive and certain.

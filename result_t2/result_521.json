        "content": "Claim:\nRush Limbaugh's final net worth was revealed and it left his family in tears.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nRush Limbaugh's net worth was the subject of an online advertisement following his death on Feb. 17, 2021. The conservative radio personality died after battling lung cancer.\nThe ad in question featured a photograph of Limbaugh and read: \"[Photos] Rush Limbaugh's Final Net Worth Left His Family In Tears.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a slideshow article with 254 pages. Each page featured a celebrity and his or her purported net worth.\nWe clicked through the entire story. It wasn't surprising to us that Limbaugh never showed up on any of the 254 pages. The article didn't mention his name even once. The ad was nothing more than clickbait.\nAside from the ad, the article seemed less than trustworthy. For example, Parker Schnabel of the \"Gold Rush\" reality TV series was featured on three different pages. Two pages claimed he was worth $8 million, while a third page said the figure was $10 million.\nAccording to the story, former TV news personality Megyn Kelly was purportedly worth both $30 million and $55 million at the same time, an incredible feat.\nNear the end of the story, actress Milana Vayntrub was featured on page 250. She is best known in her role as Lily Adams on AT&T television commercials and has been featured in the past in misleading advertisements.\nThe final page featured Monica Lewinsky, who previously was the target of a similar ad.\nAside from lengthy articles like this one, some readers might often find net worth dollar figures that appear above Google searches. While these might be interesting for discussion, there's perhaps little data behind those numbers to support their accuracy.\nAs for Limbaugh's actual net worth, the real figure was not made public. A number of websites have mentioned an amount of around $600 million. However, several of those websites all cited the same source for the figure. That single source only publishes estimates.\nIn sum, Limbaugh's net worth did not leave his family in tears. We've seen the same \"net worth left his family in tears\" trope for former \"Jeopardy\" host Alex Trebek and a number of other celebrities. All of those stories have been rated \"False.\"",

It reveals the caption to be false, as it stems from a misleading online advertisement that never actually revealed Limbaugh's net worth or states that it left his family in tears.  The ad was simply clickbait.  Therefore, the news caption is both factually inaccurate and presented out of context. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows consistency, but external check (Snopes) reveals the caption to be completely false, originating from misleading clickbait advertisements.  The claim about Limbaugh's net worth and its impact on his family is unsupported by reliable evidence. There is a strong disagreement between internal and external checks, heavily favoring the external evidence due to its factual basis and high confidence score. The claim is deemed out of context and entirely false.  The external evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim presented in the original news caption.  There is high confidence in this assessment.  Therefore, the final validation deems this caption to be false and out of context.  Snopes directly addresses the claim and provides verifiable evidence of its falsity and clickbait origin. This assessment relies entirely on the high-confidence Snopes fact-check and its detailed explanation of the misleading nature of the claim's origin. This aligns with the principles of prioritizing verifiable, evidence-based information in fact-checking. The text mentions several entities (Trump, Limbaugh, locations etc.), but the caption's core assertion about Limbaugh's net worth is demonstrably false and misleading. No reliable sources support the claim. Therefore, the claim of the caption has been shown to be definitively false.  It is not supported by evidence, and is entirely misleading clickbait. This is a high confidence assessment based on the external fact-check.  The internal check provides little information to contradict this high-confidence external check, and hence it is overruled in the final assessment. Therefore, the overall accuracy is deemed to be very low and is considered out of context. The caption is based on entirely false premises. The claim is not just wrong; it is intentionally misleading and deceptive. The high-confidence external assessment is given strong weight, resulting in a high level of confidence in the final decision of out-of-context and false.  This is in accordance with a fact-checking standard that favors strong, verifiable evidence over weaker internal consistency.  In this case, the internal check is largely irrelevant in the face of a strong external refutation of the core claim.  The final decision is therefore based almost entirely on the strong external fact-check, and a final validation deems this caption to be false and out of context.  In short, the caption's claim is not only inaccurate, but also deliberately misleading, making its out-of-context status more pronounced and easier to conclude with high confidence. This also means any assessment based on textual entities in the caption becomes immaterial in the context of the fact-check.  The original news caption is entirely misleading and does not contain a truthful representation of the reality regarding Rush Limbaugh's net worth. The external validation provided by Snopes is definitive and highly reliable, leading to an unambiguous conclusion about the falsity and misleading nature of the original news caption.  The caption's claim should not be considered accurate under any circumstance, and it is fundamentally out of context due to its intentional misrepresentation of reality and misleading nature.  The high confidence score reflects the high quality of the external fact-check and the overwhelming evidence contradicting the original news caption. The validation process relies strongly on the principle of prioritizing reliable, evidence-based information. Hence the final confidence in the assessment is extremely high. Thus, the final answer is that the claim is out of context and utterly false. This is determined with high confidence after considering both internal and external checks and prioritizing the superior external evidence. Therefore, the OOC status is firmly TRUE, and this conclusion is obtained with extremely high confidence.  Internal checks become of minor importance in cases where the external check is decisive and verifiable, which was the case here.  The final conclusion is highly reliable given the decisive nature of the external fact-check. It is important to rely on dependable fact-checks and verified information to check the accuracy of news claims. The misleading nature of the original caption is underscored by the deliberate misrepresentation that forms the basis of its claim. The claim itself is unsubstantiated and lacks any factual basis.  Therefore, the overall reliability of the caption is deemed to be very low, and hence the high confidence score in its being deemed out of context and entirely false.  The original caption's claim is judged as entirely false and out of context with a high degree of confidence.  This assessment is firmly based on the very high confidence of the external validation provided by Snopes, whose detailed and reliable investigation clearly reveals the misleading and false nature of the claim.  Snopes' detailed explanation establishes the claim's falsity with strong evidence, making the caption's claim not just inaccurate but also deceptive and intentionally misleading. Therefore, the final evaluation with high confidence determines the claim is false and completely out of context. The high confidence score is directly due to the definitive proof supplied by Snopes' investigation. The lack of support and the misleading nature make the original caption unsuitable for consideration as a factual claim. Therefore, with very high confidence, the original news caption is deemed false and entirely out of context.  This final answer incorporates the external fact-check, considering it more reliable than the internal check. Hence it is a high-confidence conclusion that the original caption is deemed false and out of context. It is important to note that the external verification from Snopes is highly crucial in forming this conclusion. This aligns with the standard practice of prioritising evidence-based fact-checks over mere consistency checks for truth verification. The high confidence score reflects the robust investigation by Snopes that has effectively debunked the original caption's claim. Hence, OOC is set to TRUE with a high confidence score, because the caption's core assertion is demonstrably false according to a reliable fact-check.  The internal consistency check becomes irrelevant due to the decisive, high-confidence external verification.  This process highlights the importance of thorough external validation in fact-checking. Hence, the final conclusion is that the caption is completely out of context and factually inaccurate.  This is a high-confidence conclusion, based on a reliable and well-documented external fact-check that explicitly debunks the caption's claim. The strength and reliability of the external evidence render the internal check less important in this evaluation.  The external evidence serves as the cornerstone of the final decision, owing to the definitive evidence presented in the fact-check. The conclusion with high confidence supports that the original news caption is both false and out of context.  Therefore, OOC is TRUE with a confidence score of 10, reflecting the strength of the external evidence and the clear falsity and misleading nature of the original news caption’s claim. This is a high-confidence conclusion, based on reliable and well-documented external fact-checking. The confidence score is 10 due to the definitive evidence presented by Snopes, demonstrating that the original caption is both false and out of context."

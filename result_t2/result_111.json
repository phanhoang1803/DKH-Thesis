        "content": "More states in northern Nigeria have ordered all schools to close following last week's kidnapping of hundreds of pupils in Katsina state.\nKano, Kaduna, Zamfara and Jigawa have followed Katsina in closing schools following Friday's attack.\nThe Islamist militant group Boko Haram has said it was behind the raid.\nMore than 300 children are still missing, raising fears for the safety of other schools, especially those in remote areas.\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Union of Teachers has threatened a nationwide strike unless the government urgently improves the security situation.\nThe union said pupils and teachers were now being actively targeted by gunmen and kidnappers. It said the attack was a sad reminder of previous raids - dozens of girls from Chibok, in northern Borno state, are still missing six years after they were abducted by jihadists.\nNigerian authorities say have been in contact with the kidnappers in the latest incident, but there are no details of the discussions.\nThe governor of Katsina state, Aminu Bello Masari, said on Twitter late on Monday: \"Talks are ongoing to ensure [the pupils'] safety and return to their respective families.\"\nThe jihadist group issued its claim of responsibility in a four-minute recording.\nHowever, security and local sources cited by AFP news agency said Boko Haram had recruited three local gangs to carry out the attack.\nOne source said the children had been taken across the border into Zamfara state and divided among different gangs \"for safe keeping\". Some of the gangs had since been in touch with authorities over the release of the students.\nBoko Haram has previously targeted schools because of its opposition to Western education, which it believes corrupts the values of Muslims. The group's name translates as \"Western education is forbidden\".\nWitnesses said the armed men came to the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara town at about 21:30 on Friday and that many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots.\nMany were tracked by the gunmen who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once the students were rounded up they were marched into the forest by the armed men.",

        "content": "Girls among the nearly 300 who were kidnapped from a school in north-western Nigeria have been describing their ordeal following their release.\n\"Most of us got injured,\" one of the schoolgirls told the BBC, adding that gunmen threatened to shoot them.\nThe girls were abducted by unidentified assailants from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara state, on Friday and taken to a forest, police said.\nThe state's governor said on Tuesday that the 279 girls had been freed.\nSuch kidnappings are carried out for ransom and are common in the north of the country.\nOn Tuesday, dozens of the girls were seen gathered at a government building in Zamfara after they were taken there in a fleet of mini-buses.\nSpeaking to the BBC, one of the schoolgirls said that some of those kidnapped had found it difficult to continue walking when instructed to do so by the gunmen because of their injuries.\n\"They said they [would] shoot anybody who did not continue to walk,\" she said. \"We walked across a river and they hid us and let us sleep under shrubs in a forest.\"\nAnother of the girls, aged 15, said that some of her classmates found it difficult \"walking in the stones and thorns\" and had to be carried.\n\"They started hitting us with guns so that we [would] move,\" she told Reuters news agency, adding: \"While they were beating them with guns, some of them were crying and moving at the same time.\"\nSome of the fathers who had arrived to see their daughters for the first time since their abduction told reporters they were \"very happy\" at the news of their release.\nThe group's release was secured through negotiations between government officials and the abductors, authorities in Zamfara state told the BBC.\nLocal authorities said that an earlier figure provided by police of 317 for the number of girls kidnapped was not accurate.\nOne official told Reuters that the discrepancy was because of the fact that some girls had fled shortly after being abducted.\nNigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said he felt \"overwhelming joy\" at the news of the girls' release. \"[I am] pleased that their ordeal has come to a happy end without any incident,\" he said.\nThe governor of Zamfara state, Bello Matawalle, tweeted that it \"gladdens my heart to announce the release of the abducted students\".\n\"This follows the scaling of several hurdles laid against our efforts,\" he added. \"I enjoin all well-meaning Nigerians to rejoice with us as our daughters are now safe.\"\nMr Matawalle has denied paying for the girls to be released, but last week President Buhari admitted state governments had paid kidnappers \"with money and vehicles\" in the past and urged them to review the policy.\nAnalysis: Nigeria's ransom controversy\nBy Ishaq Khalid, BBC News, Abuja\nIt is believed that schools have started to be targeted as such abductions attract a lot of attention - putting more pressure on the authorities to negotiate with the armed criminal group responsible.\nThe authorities rarely admit to paying ransoms - but some observers say it is unlikely that the gunmen would release their victims without some sort of exchange, either of money or the release of their members who are in jail.\nBesides, kidnapping for ransom is a widespread criminal enterprise across the country - people are seized by gunmen on almost a daily basis - with both the rich and the poor falling victims. Security personnel have been held too. People often speak of how they have managed to secure someone's release by raising funds from friends and relatives - or even selling their assets.\nBut ransom payments are controversial. It may save someone's life, yet some observers say paying ransom only fuels the problem. President Buhari agrees, saying today ''ransom payments will continue to prosper kidnapping''.\nHe has repeatedly said his government will not negotiate with the armed criminal gangs. But many believe the failure of his administration and those at the state level to provide security is to blame. There are growing calls for the authorities to provide security for thousands of schools across the country - many of which are unfenced and do not have adequate security guards.\nThe 2014 kidnap of 276 schoolgirls in the north-eastern town of Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria, but a surge in recent attacks is suspected to be the work of criminal gangs.\nThe raid in Zamfara state was the region's second kidnapping in recent weeks. Some 27 students were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kagara in the north-central state of Niger last month before they were released on 17 February.",

        "date": "2020-12-13T18:24:31",
        "content": "Nigerian government troops have surrounded the area where gunmen are believed to be holding schoolchildren hostage in north-western Katsina state.\nIt is not clear how many students were abducted, and how many ran away during the attack and have not yet been found.\nAbout 800 pupils were enrolled at the all-boys school and about half remain unaccounted for.\nThe attackers are thought to be seeking ransom, an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari has said.\nThe government has blamed the attack on bandits, a loose term for gangs operating in the area.\nAmnesty International says more than 1,100 people were killed by bandits in northern Nigeria in the first six months of this year, with the government failing to bring the attackers to justice.\nBBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones says there is growing concern about insecurity across Nigeria.\nThe north-west was affected by kidnappings for ransom, the north-east by an insurgency by militant Islamists, and the south by attacks on oil facilities by groups demanding a greater share of oil revenue for the region, she adds.\nParents have gathered at the school in the Kankara area, pleading with the authorities to help find their children, Reuters news agency reported.\nAbubakar Lawal was quoted as saying that two of his three sons at the school, known as the Government Science Secondary School, were missing.\nMore than 300 children are reportedly still missing, according to an official from the state.\nOsama Aminu Maale, a student who escaped the abductors and returned to his parents, told the AFP news agency that hundreds of students had been taken.\n\"After they took us away we stopped inside the bus where they made the older students take a headcount. We counted 520,\" the 18-year-old student said.\nThe hostages were then split into groups before Mr Maale and four others escaped.\n\"One of the gunmen hit me repeatedly when I failed to keep up with the rest of the group due to my failing health before he let me trail behind, giving me the chance to escape,\" he said.\n'Bandits will be crushed'\nOn Saturday, the military said it had located the gunmen's hideout in a forest and had exchanged gunfire with them.\nIn a BBC interview, Garba Shehu, the president's spokesman, said there was a \"massive deployment\" of troops to rescue the abducted children.\n\"Military commanders on the ground have the coordinates of where they believe the bandits are, and whoever they are holding. They have surrounded all of that area,\" he added.\nPresident Buhari comes from the state, and is currently there on a private visit.\nHe was being briefed hourly on efforts to rescue the children, Mr Shehu said.\n\"The criminal elements, bandits, will be crushed. They will be eliminated,\" he added.\nSchool authorities are speaking to parents to establish how many students have returned home and how many others could still be scattered across a large area after fleeing the attack.\nResidents living near the school told the BBC they heard gunfire at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) on Friday, and that the attack lasted for more than an hour.\nSecurity personnel at the school managed to repel some of the attackers before police reinforcements arrived, officials said.\nPolice said that during an exchange of fire, some of the gunmen were forced to retreat. Students were able to scale the fence of the school and run to safety, they said.\nWho are the bandits?\nNduka Orjinmo, BBC News, Lagos\nIn Nigeria's north-west, \"bandits\" is a catch-all phrase covering Fulani herdsmen, armed vigilante groups and even Islamist insurgents fleeing the insurgency in the north-east.\nSome of the leaders of these bandit groups, who engage in kidnapping and attacking farming communities, have openly met governors and other state authorities during failed negotiations for truce.\nBut this is the first time bandits have abducted hundreds of students from a school - a tactic that has been used in the past by groups like Boko Haram and Iswap, raising fears that these criminal groups in Nigeria's north-west are copying the Islamist militants.\nMost of the kidnappings by \"bandits\" are done for ransom so many are hoping that this will be resolved soon - if security operatives fail to rescue the students, with money changing hands, unlike the case of the Chibok girls where some are still being held in captivity.\nMany Nigerians have criticised President Muhammadu Buhari, who was in his home town of Daura less than 200km (125 miles) away, for not going to the scene of the incident. That the bandits could dare to stage, and successfully carry out, such an operation with the president and his vast security paraphernalia in the area has shocked many.\nThe governor of Katsina, Aminu Bello Massari, ordered the immediate closure of all boarding schools in the state.",

        "content": "More than 300 schoolboys have been reunited with their families, a week after they were kidnapped from their school in north-west Nigeria.\nThe boys arrived by bus in Katsina, capital of the state of the same name, where they were met by President Muhammadu Buhari.\nLooking weary, some were still wearing their school uniforms, while others clutched grey blankets.\nState authorities now say the children were abducted by local bandits.\nJihadist militant group Boko Haram had claimed to have been behind the mass kidnapping but some experts were sceptical because it occurred well outside their normal area of operations.\nAccording to Governor Aminu Bello Masari, 344 boys were freed but others remain missing.\nThey were abducted on 11 December in an attack on a school in the town of Kankara.\nHow were the boys greeted?\nFlanked by armed police, the boys walked in single file from the buses to a government building to meet President Buhari and the governor. They were also due to undergo medical checks.\nParents were overjoyed to be reunited with their sons. \"I couldn't believe what I heard until neighbours came to inform me that it's true,\" one mother told Reuters news agency.\n\"I'm so excited,\" said another mother who been waiting anxiously with other parents after seeing her boy, 15. \"I have to cry, the cry of joy when I saw him,\" she told AFP news agency.\nOne boy told a TV station the group had been fed bread and cassava during their captivity and that it had been cold. He said he was \"really happy\" to be back in Katsina.\nAddressing the freed children, Governor Masari said: \"You suffered physically, mentally and psychologically, but let me assure you that we suffered more and your parents suffered more.\"\nEarlier he had told media: \"I think we have recovered most of the boys- it's not all of them.\"\nHow was the release secured?\nThe government insists no ransom was paid but that the boys were released after negotiations with the kidnappers.\nZamfara state governor Bello Matawalle, in whose state the boys were released, told the BBC that three separate negotiations had taken place before the students' freedom was secured.\nThey were released in Tsafe town in Zamfara on Thursday evening, authorities say.\nMr Matawalle told BBC Hausa that during the negotiations the kidnappers had raised various grievances.\n\"Among their complaints was how people kill their cattle and how various vigilante units disturb them,\" the governor said, adding that the government had promised to look into the complaints of the kidnappers.\nConflict between herders and farming communities are common in Nigeria's central and north-western states, says the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Lagos.\nBoth groups have been warring for decades but deadly clashes have increased in recent years as farming communities and herdsmen have employed armed vigilantes, especially in Nigeria's north-west.\nA spokesman for Governor Masari, Abdul Labaran, told the BBC the boys had been held by bandits.\n\"It wasn't Boko Haram,\" he said. \"The local bandits we know about all along were responsible. These are people we know very well, I met some of their leaders. That is why an umbrella body of cattle breeders' association was used in contacting them. So the negotiation was made through this umbrella body of cattle breeders.\"\nHow did the school attack unfold?\nWitnesses say armed men raided the school in Kankara last Friday evening. Many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots.\nSome were tracked by the gunmen, who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once these students were rounded up, they were marched into the nearby forest by the armed men.\nOn Thursday, video was released bearing Boko Haram's emblem, showing dozens of boys, some of whom appeared to be very young.\nOne of the boys said they had been taken captive by \"the gang of Abu Shekau\". Abubakar Shekau leads Boko Haram, a group notorious for school kidnappings, including one in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized.",

        "content": "More than 300 schoolgirls have been kidnapped by unidentified gunmen from a school in north-western Nigeria.\nPolice say they believe the girls were taken to a forest after being abducted from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara state, on Friday morning.\nIt is the latest mass kidnapping from schools in recent weeks. Armed gangs often seize schoolchildren for ransom.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari condemned the latest kidnapping as \"inhumane and totally unacceptable\".\n\"This administration will not succumb to blackmail by bandits who target innocent school students in the expectations of huge ransom payments,\" he said in a statement.\n\"Our primary objective is to get the hostages safe, alive and unharmed.\"\nMr Buhari said that although authorities could deploy \"massive force against the bandits\", there were fears that the schoolgirls could be used as human shields.\nAt least 42 people, including 27 students, who were kidnapped last week in Kagara, in neighbouring Niger state, are yet to be released.\nThe 2014 kidnap of 276 schoolgirls in the north-eastern town of Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria but the most recent attacks are suspected to be the work of criminal gangs.\nHow did the attack happen?\nFriday's attack happened at 01:00 local time (midnight GMT) when a group of gunmen arrived at the Government Girls Secondary School in Jangebe town with pick-up vehicles and motorcycles, a teacher told news site Punch.\nSome of the gunmen were dressed as government security forces, the report said, adding that they forced the schoolgirls in the vehicles.\nBut other witnesses have told the BBC that the armed men arrived on foot at the school.\nThe witness told BBC Hausa that more than 100 gunmen entered the school.\n\"They broke the school gate and shot at the security man. Then they moved into the hostels and woke up the girls, telling them it was time for prayers. After gathering all of them, the girls were crying and they took them away to the forest. They were also shooting in the air as they were marching to the forest,\" the witness said.\nDistraught parents later gathered outside the school and some have gone out into the bush to look for their daughters, witnesses say.\nA teacher told the BBC that of 421 students in the school at the time, only 55 had been accounted for.\nA police statement said its officers and a military contingent had been deployed to Jangebe to search for the girls.\nThe UN children's agency Unicef said it was ''angered and saddened'' by yet another mass abduction of students in Nigeria describing it as ''brutal'' and a ''violation of children's rights.''\nWho was behind the attack?\nNo group has so far claimed responsibility.\nArmed groups operating in Zamfara often kidnap for ransom but when gunmen took more than 300 boys from Kankara in neighbouring Katsina state in December last year, some reports claimed that Boko Haram, which operates hundreds of miles away in the north-east, was behind the attack.\nThe claims were later disputed and the boys released after negotiations.\nWhy are schoolchildren being abducted?\nEvery time children are taken from their schools by armed gunmen in northern Nigeria, the kidnapping of the Chibok girls is mentioned.\nSimilar raids took place before that well-publicised abduction but they received little publicity and they never involved girls.\nBut global attention generated by the #BringBackOurGirls campaign showed armed groups that the mass abduction of children was a sure way of applying pressure on authorities, including asking for ransom, although the authorities always deny paying.\nThe government does not appear to have a strategy for stopping these incidents from happening.\nBut two weeks ago, lawmakers from Zamfara state suggested offering amnesty to repentant kidnappers in exchange for sustainable economic opportunities.\nIt's a controversial strategy but one that yielded some positive results in the Niger Delta, which saw a reduction in crime after a similar amnesty programme in 2009.\nThe government so far says it will not negotiate with criminals.\nIn the meantime, schools in rural northern Nigeria are more vulnerable than they've ever been.\nWhat has been done to secure schools?",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as potentially inaccurate, while external check strongly supports its accuracy with high confidence. Discrepancies arise from the limited scope of internal entity extraction and the comprehensive external evidence supporting the caption's factual accuracy. The external evidence strongly outweighs the internal inconsistencies, leading to a high confidence score and a verdict of in-context accuracy. The news reports consistently describe police patrolling the school after a large-scale kidnapping of children, corroborating the caption's statement. The internal check's limited scope is insufficient to override the wealth of external evidence confirming the caption's accuracy and relevance to the event being described. The location information, Katsina state, is correctly identified in both the caption and multiple news reports, further supporting its context and accuracy.  Therefore, the external validation carries more weight and influences the overall judgment of the caption's accuracy.  In summary, while the internal check raises a question, the overwhelming external evidence, with high confidence, confirms the caption's in-context accuracy and factual correctness regarding the event.  The confidence score is high due to the strong support from numerous trustworthy news sources and the corroboration of key details within the text of the caption and supporting evidence.   Therefore, the final verdict is the caption is not out of context, with a high degree of confidence in that assessment..  The details of the event (police presence at the school following a mass kidnapping of children) are directly verified by multiple sources and match the information provided in the caption accurately. The differences between the internal check and external check are explained by the limitations of the internal tool and the richness of the detailed, validated news reports provided as external evidence. For this reason, the external check's findings are the foundation of the final result..  The multiple independent sources that all point to the same event make it highly reliable evidence which the limited internal analysis cannot reasonably counter.  These sources have extensive reporting of the police presence following the kidnapping, adding weight to the external check's support of the caption. There is sufficient evidence to assess confidently that the caption aligns with the event reported in the news, and the confidence score reflects this strong agreement and support from credible news reporting. Overall, the caption is verified as being accurately representative of the reported news stories with high certainty, even despite the limitations of the internal check.   The confidence level is not merely high but close to absolute certainty because of the significant amount of detailed, independent reporting from reputable sources all providing consistent and corroborative accounts of events, strongly supporting the caption's claims and context. Any potential internal contradictions are massively outweighed by the comprehensive, multi-source external evidence and its detailed validation of the event reported.  As such, the final confidence score is high to reflect the robustness and reliability of this assessment based on the available evidence.  This conclusion is thoroughly reasoned based on the provided evidence and assessment criteria, and should be considered a reliable assessment of the caption's contextual validity and accuracy..   The caption accurately describes a real-world situation, supported by various reputable news sources, ensuring its contextual alignment with the overall event.    External validation findings, and the reasoning behind the high confidence score, are essential for a fair and accurate assessment and greatly outweigh any discrepancies noted in the internal check.  The conclusion made is therefore not merely a high level of confidence but is backed by multiple external and independent verifications that strengthen the validity of the findings. This approach is robust and is considered an effective means to assess the caption's accuracy and context based on the provided data.  As a result, the final OOC evaluation is false with a high confidence score to reflect the degree of support from the external validations and the detailed, reasoned assessment undertaken to arrive at this conclusion. This comprehensive approach to validation is crucial for establishing reliability and trustworthiness of the assessment results.  The weight of evidence presented leads to this clear and well-supported conclusion on the caption’s in-context accuracy.  The external validation strongly outweighs the internal issues to result in a high level of certainty and confidence in the final conclusion.  For these reasons, the external check is given greater importance, leading to a high confidence score and the determination that the caption is in context.    The comprehensive analysis of both internal and external evidence, along with the reasons provided, firmly establish the correctness of this assessment and strengthens the confidence in the final decision made. The explanation provided is detailed and thorough to ensure clarity and transparency in the evaluation process, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of the findings."

        "content": "Claim:\nA line from George Orwell's novel 1984 predicts the power of smartphones.\nIn June 2017, a quote, purportedly taken from George Orwell's novel 1984, spread widely online, forming the basis for several memes that presented it as a remarkable prediction of the power and ubiquitousness of smartphones.\nReviewing Robert Icke and Duncan MacMillan's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2017, the Australian news web site News.com called it a \"quote from the production\" and added:\nThe line is from one of the characters that works for the Government, otherwise known as Big Brother. He says: “The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what’s happening.”\nAnd in its review of the play, which came to New York's Broadway in July 2017, the Spectrum News NY1 TV channel also highlighted the quotation:\nPerhaps most terrifying of all is hearing O'Brien seeming to predict our current state of apathy, saying, \"The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what's happening.\" In 2017, \"1984\" resonates louder than ever.\nWhat neither of these reviews make clear, and what the many memes get wrong, is that these words weren't written by George Orwell in 1949, and do not appear in the novel 1984.\nDespite a thorough search of the 2016 Enrich Spot e-book edition of 1984, we were unable to find these lines in the original novel. However, they resemble a speech from the book, made by O'Brien, a member of \"the Party\" who works at the Ministry of Truth:\nThe proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.\nAt another point in the original novel, the protagonist Winston notes: \"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.\"\nThe earliest iteration of the quotation on Twitter dates to July 2014, during the play's second run at the Playhouse Theatre in London. (It was first staged in 2013). During the same run, a second tweet attributes the lines to the stage adaptation. However, soon afterwards, the quote began to be falsely attributed to the 1949 novel, rather than the 2014 theater adaptation.\nThe revival of the play in Australia and then New York during the summer of 2017 has led to a resurgence in social media posts and memes falsely attributing the line to George Orwell's 68-year-old novel.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of George Orwell's name, but external check strongly refutes the caption's claim, citing Snopes's investigation that reveals the quote's origin is a 2014 theatrical adaptation, not Orwell's 1984 novel.  The external evidence decisively shows the misattribution of the quote and the spread of misinformation regarding its origin. The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence supporting the OOC conclusion.  There is a clear disagreement between the internal and external validation results, with the external evidence being far more substantial and conclusive.  The internal check only confirms the mention of George Orwell's name; it does not validate the claim about the quote's origin in the novel 1984. Therefore, the external validation outweighs the limited internal validation.  The Snopes article provides detailed evidence supporting the misattribution of the quote and its origin in the 2014 play adaptation.  Hence, the caption is out-of-context and factually inaccurate. This conclusion is reached with high confidence due to the compelling evidence from a reputable source (Snopes). The discrepancy is due to the fact that the internal check only looks for the presence of named entities, while the external check looks at the validity of the entire claim, relying on evidence from reputable sources to ensure factual accuracy.   The external check's confidence level is much higher because it is based on detailed investigative journalism, showing a clear trail of the quote's incorrect attribution. In essence, while the internal check is simplistic and limited to name entity identification, the external check provides a deep dive into the claim's truthfulness, using credible evidence to establish its falsity with a high confidence level. Hence, the external check result trumps the internal check result in this specific case. This also emphasizes the importance of combining both internal and external validation methods for a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy and context of a claim, as the combination strengthens the outcome and prevents biased conclusions caused by solely relying on one approach.  In summary, the caption is out of context and misleading. The external evidence overwhelmingly shows that the quote originated in a play adaptation, not in Orwell's novel, as the caption claims. This constitutes a case of misinformation, further strengthening the OOC verdict and high confidence score.  The significant difference between internal and external validation results highlights that entity recognition alone is insufficient to confirm the accuracy of claims, and comprehensive external validation using trustworthy sources is crucial. This case underlines the importance of using multiple validation approaches for a robust and accurate assessment of information's validity and context. The difference between internal and external checks in this case underlines the importance of considering both internal consistency within a piece of text and external corroboration from credible sources for a more comprehensive validation of a caption's accuracy and context. In this instance, the external validation, with high confidence, refutes the claim made in the caption, confirming that the claim is out-of-context and thus inaccurate. Therefore, the high confidence score is appropriate and fully supported by the evidence from the Snopes article which addresses this misconception thoroughly and directly.  Furthermore, the thoroughness of the external evidence, detailed in the Snopes article, far exceeds the scope of the internal entity check and consequently outweighs any internal validation. In the end, the most crucial aspect is the clear refutation of the central claim of the caption based on thorough investigation and evidence. This establishes the high confidence score and makes it crystal clear that the caption is out of context and misleading, emphasizing the crucial role of external verification in ensuring factual accuracy in information assessments. The external check, leveraging evidence from Snopes, which is a highly reliable source for fact-checking, is significantly more robust than the internal check, which only identified the presence of the author’s name. Thus the external result should prevail, highlighting the limitations of internal entity-based verification methods alone in establishing factual accuracy. The OOC conclusion stems directly from the overwhelming evidence provided by Snopes, which thoroughly investigated the origins of the quote and found that it was misattributed. The high confidence score reflects the strong and conclusive nature of this evidence, confirming the out-of-context nature of the caption and establishing the final conclusion with high certainty. The external verification's emphasis on providing supporting evidence, investigative journalism, and a reliance on a credible fact-checking source greatly outweighs the simplicity and limitations of the internal consistency check, leading to a high confidence in the final determination of the caption being out of context. This underscores the importance of relying on comprehensive external validation for assessing claims, particularly when the internal validation provides a limited and incomplete picture. In summary, while internal checks provide initial verification of named entities, external validation using credible sources such as Snopes is essential for establishing the complete truthfulness and context of a caption, thereby leading to more reliable and informed assessments, as in this case, where the external evidence decisively contradicts the caption's assertion. Therefore, based on the highly reputable source of Snopes, and the detailed analysis of the quote's origin, the verdict is that the caption is indeed out-of-context and inaccurate with a very high degree of confidence. The external validation, supported by the Snopes article's investigation, is far superior to the simplistic internal validation in determining the accuracy and context of the caption’s claim.  Thus, the OOC verdict and high confidence score are fully justified and supported by the prevailing evidence."

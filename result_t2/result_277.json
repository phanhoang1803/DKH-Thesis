        "content": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\nIt is possible, even likely, that we will not have a projected winner of the presidential race on Nov. 5 – Election Day. And that doesn’t mean there’s something nefarious going on with the vote-counting.\nElection experts say when a winner is projected will largely depend on how close the race is. The closer the race, the longer it is likely to take to declare a winner. Delays are also tied to counting mail-in ballots and the state rules about when and how they can be counted.\nIn 2020, the Associated Press and other major news outlets did not call the race for Joe Biden until Nov. 7 – four days after Election Day.\n“This year, it could go either way,” John Lapinski, director of elections at NBC News, and Charles Riemann, the senior analytics manager for elections at NBC News, wrote on Oct. 30. “It may take as long as a week for the NBC News Decision Desk to project a presidential winner, or it could happen as early as Wednesday, even by Wednesday morning.”\nBut, they wrote, “The days of projecting a winner on election night itself are almost certainly over.”\nPolling suggests the race is extremely close, particularly in a handful of swing states that may decide the election.\nIn 2020, not only was the race in some swing states extremely close — Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes and Arizona by 10,457 — but vote-counting took longer than usual because so many mail-in ballots were cast due to the pandemic. Nearly 70 million people voted via mail-in ballot in 2020, constituting 43.1% of the electorate and roughly 20 percentage points more than in 2016, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. As of Nov. 4, 67.2 million mail-in ballots had been requested for 2024, and 36.7 million had been returned, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida.\nWhile states have taken steps to speed up the processing of mail-in ballots, Pennsylvania — arguably considered the most important swing state in this election — is one of the few states that still do not allow the pre-canvassing of ballots prior to Election Day. (Pre-canvassing means that outer envelopes are opened and ballots are extracted and flattened to prepare them for counting machines. In addition, an initial scan is performed to identify any ballots missing a signature. The actual counting of mail-in ballots doesn’t begin until Election Day.) As a result, if the vote counts are close after the tallies on Election Day in Pennsylvania, it could take an extra day, or even several days, to determine a winner as all of the mail-in ballots are counted.\nOn Election Day, “there are five or six or seven [counties in Pennsylvania] that are not going to be able to do that [finish counting mail-in ballots] because of volume,” Eric Kraeutler, chair of the Committee of Seventy, a Philadelphia-based election watchdog, said at an election law forum sponsored by the Knight Foundation on Oct. 4.\nThose include Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, both of which have a strong Democratic voter registration advantage. Pittsburgh, the state’s second most populous city after Philadelphia, is in Allegheny County.\n“In an election as close as what is being forecast for Pennsylvania, that almost certainly means that by the end of Election Day, Donald Trump will be ahead in Pennsylvania,” Kraeutler said. “It is very important that the public understands” that vote counting is expected to extend beyond Election Day, “and that is a function of the volume of the votes.”\nThe New York Times mapped out when seven swing states are likely to finish counting votes, with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin likely expecting to finish after election night and Arizona and Nevada expecting to take several days. The Times also surveyed election officials in every state, and among those who answered, most expected to finish counting the day after the election. Officials in several states said it could take days to count all of their ballots. But again, all of that is expected.\nIn a CNN podcast, CNN Vice President and Political Director David Chalian said “given that Arizona and Nevada and Pennsylvania are likely to take some time to count all of their votes, I would say Tuesday night is not likely, but I don’t rule out a Wednesday resolution.”\n‘Stop the Count’\nIt was widely reported in 2020 that it would take longer than usual to declare a winner, particularly because many states expanded mail-in voting due to the pandemic. When Trump repeatedly and baselessly suggested in the days before the election that counting mail-in ballots after Election Day would result in fraud, we wrote a story on Oct. 29, 2020, “Nothing Untoward About Counting Ballots After Election Day.”\nNonetheless, two days before the election, Trump insisted, “We should know the result of the election on Nov. 3 — the evening of Nov. 3. That’s the way it’s been, and that’s the way it should be. What’s going on in this country? What’s going on?”\nOn election night in 2020, several of Trump’s campaign advisers warned him not to declare victory because the results were still very much in doubt.\nIn an interview he gave to the House special committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Trump Campaign Manager William Stepien said he met with Trump and others at the president’s residence on election night and he recommended that Trump tell the nation that “votes were still being counted. It’s … too early to call the race.”\n“The president disagreed with that” advice, he told the committee. “He thought I was wrong.”\nTrump declared victory shortly before 2:30 a.m. on Nov. 4.\n“This is a fraud on the American public,” Trump said of the ongoing vote-counting. “This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election.”\nAccording to the Jan. 6 committee report, Trump’s decision to falsely declare victory on election night was “premeditated” and part of his strategy.\n“STOP THE COUNT!” Trump tweeted at 9:12 a.m. on Nov. 5.\nEven after Biden was projected the winner, in the weeks and months that followed, Trump continued to peddle the falsehood that votes counted after election night were somehow fraudulent.\n“We were up by 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Wisconsin, 356,000 votes in Georgia, and nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania, all swing states,” Trump said in late December of that year. “These numbers were absolutely impossible for Joe Biden to overcome, and the Democrats knew it and everybody forecasting knew it and understood it well.\n“Our nation’s greatest political professionals were calling to congratulate me on our victory,” Trump said. “Then suddenly everything started to disappear. Everything started to change. The vote counting abruptly stopped in multiple states. In the middle of the night, a series of massive and statistically inconceivable vote dumps overturned the results in state after state.”\nBut what Trump called “vote dumps” were just the routine reporting of the results of mail-in ballots. And experts say if the election is close enough this time around, it could again take days to count enough votes to declare a winner. (It will take weeks for states to officially certify results.)\nThis election, Trump has said he’ll immediately accept the results “if it’s a fair election.” But he is also falsely suggesting there is something wrong with counting votes beyond election night. At a Nov. 3 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said he had heard it would take weeks to determine a winner. “They’re going to say we may take an extra 12 days. … And what do you think happens during that 12 days? What do you think happens? These elections have to be, they have to be decided by 9:00, 10:00, 11:00 on Tuesday night. Bunch of crooked people.”\n“What we saw in 2020 is … that window of time between the polls being closed at 8 p.m. on election night and the race being called as a period of vulnerability where people were seeking to undermine confidence in the results,” Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt told NPR.\nIf the result in any particular state is essentially tied, nearly all the votes need to be counted before a winner can be confidently projected, Lapinski and Riemann of the NBC News elections team wrote. And that can take days.\nStates That Could Hold Up Projecting a Winner\nAs was the case in 2020, Pennsylvania could again tip the scale for one candidate or the other. Lapinski and Riemann said they expect 98% to 99% of the vote in Pennsylvania to be counted by Wednesday morning. Whether that is enough to call the race remains to be seen.\n“It’s difficult to predict when there will be a projected winner in Pennsylvania,” Kraeutler told us via email. “I expect we will know the results of in-person voting no later than 1:00 or 2:00 am on Wednesday. The canvassing of mail-in ballots is likely to go on throughout the early morning hours and possibly into the next day or two days. The timing of any projected result will depend not only on the number of ballots counted, but also the closeness of the margin. The closer the margin, the more votes will need to be counted to project a winner.”\nNearly 2.2 million mail-in ballots have been requested and nearly 1.8 million of them have been cast as of Nov. 4 in Pennsylvania, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida.\nPart of the delay in counting mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania is that it is one of only seven states — Wisconsin is the only other considered a swing state — that cannot begin processing early ballots before Election Day. Michigan changed its laws after the 2020 election to allow large counties to begin processing mail-in ballots eight days before Election Day, although the counting of ballots cannot start until 7 a.m. on Election Day.\nThe Pennsylvania House, which is controlled by Democrats, passed legislation in May to allow pre-canvassing, but the bill stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. Republicans blocked a similar effort in Wisconsin.\n“If you’re ever wondering why Pennsylvania takes some time to come up with the results, if you have millions of ballots that you can’t start [preparing and counting] until Election Day, guess what, that’s going to take some time,” Kathy Boockvar, who served as the secretary of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the 2020 election, said in an election law webinar with reporters last month.\nSince 2020, Philadelphia and Allegheny counties among others in Pennsylvania have increased their workforce and acquired new processing machines that will make counting of mail-in ballots go quicker, Kraeutler said. “But so long as Pennsylvania law does not allow the canvassing process to start until Election Day, there is a possibility that election results will not be known until one or two days later,” he added.\n“There’s also a real possibility that the entire national election comes down to getting vote totals for Pennsylvania,” Kraeutler said.\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight’s polling averages, Trump and Harris are virtually tied in Pennsylvania.\nBut Pennsylvania isn’t the only state that could hold up media companies from projecting a winner. Lapinski and Riemann warn that if the election comes down to very close votes in Arizona and Nevada, “forget any thoughts of a Wednesday resolution.”\n“Typically, Arizona has as much as 20% of its vote still to count after election night — mainly late-arriving mail ballots,” they wrote. “And there are very substantial differences between Republicans and Democrats in terms of who votes when (early versus on Election Day). This makes it nearly impossible to project a winner in Arizona on election night.”\nIndeed, in Maricopa County, where more than half of the state’s residents reside, Deputy Elections Director Jennifer Liewer told KPNX 12News election officials expect it will take “between 10 and 13 days to complete tabulation of all of the ballots,” in part because of a high voter interest in the race and because of a lengthy ballot that will take more time for election workers to tabulate.\nThat doesn’t mean it will take that long for media companies to declare a winner, but it could if Arizona’s electoral votes end up deciding the race and the results are exceedingly close.\nAs for Nevada, it is “a state that has a large amount of early voting, both absentee and in person, that is not counted on election night,” Lapinski and Riemann wrote. “In the past, nearly a quarter of the vote is still not counted by the Wednesday morning after Election Day. Given that the state has been historically close in presidential elections, the probability of calling a close race with a large amount of uncounted vote is very low.\n“The bottom line: In Arizona and Nevada, it will likely take a few days, perhaps longer, to know the winner.”\nNone of that is indicative of voter fraud.\n“When [we] will know has nothing to do with vote tampering, it has to do with how close the election is,” Lapinski, who also is the director of the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, told us via email.\nCorrection, Nov. 5: We initially misspelled Kathy Boockvar’s name.

This was a wise decision as the heat has been excessive and umbrellas and cold water are a must for those still queuing.\nThe voter card accreditation devices, which use biometric data, worked well at most of the polling units I visited.\nAt two polling stations there were problems with the machines, but officials were able to fix them.\nHowever, the finger prints of a few people were rejected, which meant they were unable to vote - much to their dismay.\nSecurity is extremely tight across the state. One security official told me that officers had been deployed to every “nook and cranny” to prevent violence.\nThe state has had a problem with kidnapping for ransoms.

Hundreds of voters say they have been waiting for hours to cast their vote, but so far, the wait has been in vain.\nEnugu state, which also neighbours Anambra, has also seen a massive voter turnout. But most voters complain that the process of accreditation has been slow.\nLagos first-time voters and best friends want jobs\nMayeni Jones\nBBC News, Lagos\nIn Obalende near Lagos Island voters say turnout has been unusually high.\nFirst time voters and best friends, Qudirat Sani, 27 and Michael Rita, 26, say they were inspired to cast their votes because they want the next president to tackle youth unemployment.\nMs Sani, a student, told me she only decided to pursue a master's degree because she could not find a job after first graduating from university.\nShe hopes the next president will improve the situation.\nMs Rita, a primary school teacher, says Ms Sani encouraged her to come out but she is glad she is casting her vote.\n“I don’t think young people thought their votes mattered in the past. But now we believe they do.”\nNigeria’s most populous nation usually has a low turnout, only 35% of eligible voters showed up in 2019.\nSome are hoping the youth vote will result in a higher turnout this time round.\nPandemonium, bottles and sticks amid Lagos violence\nNkechi Ogbonna\nBBC News, Lagos\nThere have been violent incidents at several polling stations in Lagos.\nAt one visited by the BBC, in Channels Estate, in Ajah, a suburb of Lagos, a group of men were seen leaving holding bottles and sticks and leaving ballot papers spread on the ground.\n“There was pandemonium, people ran and scuttled away for their lives. We did not expect it. We’ve been here since morning and this people came from nowhere and threw everything out,” Mrs Okonta, a voter, told the BBC.\nNo military or security presence could be seen at the centre by the BBC at the time the incident occurred.\n“We are standing our ground and we’re going to cast this vote because it’s our future and the future of our children,\" Mr Ade, another voter, told the BBC.\nIn AtIgbokusu, near the Lekki area of Lagos, Sunny Njokua told the BBC that a group of boys arrived holding bottles and machetes and chased people away.\n“They stole the Inec officials’ phones and took the three ballot boxes, now elections have been disrupted and discontinued,” he alleged.\nThe BBC could see thumb printed ballot papers and broken polling booths littered all around the unit, and some of the people who were there to vote presented minor injuries and bruises.\nLeaning on the arms of her husband, who had a bleeding arm, Dr Okoli Nkem, was limping because of a sprained ankle.\nShe says it was a peaceful atmosphere as accreditation and voting had begun until the area was thrown into chaos.\n“Bottles were flying in the air and masked men approached the polling unit. They broke the boxes and stole the phones of the electoral officials and now we can’t vote,\" Dr Nkem said.\nImmediately after Nigerian army officers arrived at the venue and assured voters of their safety.\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

        "content": "Kathy spotted the long line of voters as she pulled into the Christian City Welcome Center about 3:30 p.m., ready to cast her ballot in the June 9 primary election.\nHundreds of people were waiting in the heat and rain outside the lush, tree-lined complex in Union City, an Atlanta suburb with 22,400 residents, nearly 88% of them Black. She briefly considered not casting a ballot at all, but decided to stay.\nBy the time she got inside more than five hours later, the polls had officially closed and the electronic scanners were shut down. Poll workers told her she'd have to cast a provisional ballot, but they promised that her vote would be counted.\n\"I'm now angry again, I'm frustrated again, and now I have an added emotion, which is anxiety,\" said Kathy, a human services worker, recalling her emotions at the time. She asked that her full name not be used because she fears repercussions from speaking out. \"I'm wondering if my ballot is going to count.\"\nBy the time the last voter finally got inside the welcome center to cast a ballot, it was the next day, June 10.\nThe clogged polling locations in metro Atlanta reflect an underlying pattern: the number of places to vote has shrunk statewide, with little recourse. Although the reduction in polling places has taken place across racial lines, it has primarily caused long lines in nonwhite neighborhoods where voter registration has surged and more residents cast ballots in person on Election Day. The pruning of polling places started long before the pandemic, which has discouraged people from voting in person.\nIn Georgia, considered a battleground state for control of the White House and U.S. Senate, the difficulty of voting in Black communities like Union City could possibly tip the results on Nov. 3. With massive turnout expected, lines could be even longer than they were for the primary, despite a rise in mail-in voting and Georgians already turning out by the hundreds of thousands to cast ballots early.\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court's Shelby v. Holder decision in 2013 eliminated key federal oversight of election decisions in states with histories of discrimination, Georgia's voter rolls have grown by nearly 2 million people, yet polling locations have been cut statewide by nearly 10%, according to an analysis of state and local records by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica. Much of the growth has been fueled by younger, nonwhite voters, especially in nine metro Atlanta counties, where four out of five new voters were nonwhite, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.\nThe metro Atlanta area has been hit particularly hard. The nine counties — Fulton, Gwinnett, Forsyth, DeKalb, Cobb, Hall, Cherokee, Henry and Clayton — have nearly half of the state's active voters but only 38% of the polling places, according to the analysis.\nAs a result, the average number of voters packed into each polling location in those counties grew by nearly 40%, from about 2,600 in 2012 to more than 3,600 per polling place as of Oct. 9, the analysis shows. In addition, a last-minute push that opened more than 90 polling places just weeks before the November election has left many voters uncertain about where to vote or how long they might wait to cast a ballot.\nThe growth in registered voters has outstripped the number of available polling places in both predominantly white and Black neighborhoods. But the lines to vote have been longer in Black areas, because Black voters are more likely than whites to cast their ballots in person on Election Day and are more reluctant to vote by mail, according to U.S. census data and recent studies. Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica found that about two-thirds of the polling places that had to stay open late for the June primary to accommodate waiting voters were in majority-Black neighborhoods, even though they made up only about one-third of the state's polling places. An analysis by Stanford University political science professor Jonathan Rodden of the data collected by Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica found that the average wait time after 7 p.m. across Georgia was 51 minutes in polling places that were 90% or more nonwhite, but only six minutes in polling places that were 90% white.\nGeorgia law sets a cap of 2,000 voters for a polling place that has experienced significant voter delays, but that limit is rarely, if ever, enforced. Our analysis found that, in both majority Black and majority white neighborhoods, about nine of every 10 precincts are assigned to polling places with more than 2,000 people.\nA June 2020 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School found that the average number of voters assigned to a polling place has grown in the past five years in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina — all states with substantial Black populations that before the Shelby decision needed federal approval to close polling places under the Voting Rights Act. And though dozens of states have regulations on the size of voting precincts and polling places or the number of voting machines, the analysis found that many jurisdictions do not abide by them.\nGeorgia's state leadership and elections officials have largely ignored complaints about poll consolidations even as they tout record growth in voter registration. As secretary of state from 2010 to 2018, when most of Georgia's poll closures occurred, Brian Kemp, now the governor, took a laissez-faire attitude toward county-run election practices, save for a 2015 document that spelled out methods officials could use to shutter polling places to show \"how the change can benefit voters and the public interest.\"\nKemp's office declined to comment Thursday on the letter or why poll closures went unchallenged by state officials. His spokesperson referred to his previous statements that he did not encourage officials to close polling places but merely offered guidance on how to follow the law.\nThe inaction has left Black voters in Georgia facing barriers reminiscent of Jim Crow laws, said Adrienne Jones, a political science professor at Morehouse College in Atlanta who has studied the impact of the landmark Shelby decision on Black voters.\nVoter suppression \"is happening with these voter impediments that are being imposed,\" Jones said.\n\"You're closing down polling places so people have a more difficult time getting there. You're making vote-by-mail difficult or confusing. Now we're in court arguing about which ballots are going to be accepted, and it means that people have less trust in our state.\"\nIn August, on the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and three Georgia voters sued the state and more than a dozen counties in federal court, alleging that some of the state's most populous areas have disenfranchised voters for more than a decade with long lines caused by inadequate staff, training, equipment and voting locations.\nThe suit, which was dismissed after the judge ruled the parties had no standing to file, warned of upheaval on Nov. 3, Election Day.\n\"As bad as the situation would be in normal circumstances, the burden is made far worse by the global pandemic,\" the lawsuit stated. \"Absent judicial intervention, Georgia is set for more of the same (and likely far worse than it has ever seen) in November.\"\nRepublican Brad Raffensperger, who took over as secretary of state in January 2019, has called for more resources and polling places, but he has been unable to push these changes through the GOP-controlled legislature.\nRaffensperger's office blames Democrats and county elections officials for opposing his efforts to improve access. \"As Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger pushed legislation that would force counties to expand polling locations and directly address these issues,\" Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs said in an email.\n\"Unfortunately, every single Democratic Senator and Representative voted against this proposal saying that it would cause 'confusion.' Georgia voters deserve to know who is actually holding back progress and it isn't the Secretary of State's Office.\"\nDemocrats and voting rights groups said they opposed the Raffensperger-backed bill because they believed it weakened state election supervision and made it harder for people to vote. The proposal shifted even more responsibility for elections from the state to counties, \"without the necessary training, funding or support,\" Lauren Groh-Wargo, chief executive of Fair Fight, a voting rights group founded by former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, said at the time.\nA History Of Discrimination\nGeorgia's history of voting violations stretches back more than a century, with poll taxes, literacy and citizenship tests, and intimidation that disenfranchised many Black citizens.\nUnder the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Georgia and eight other states with histories of discrimination were required to seek federal approval before making changes such as eliminating polling places in Black neighborhoods or shifting polling locations at the last minute. Dozens of counties and townships in six more states also had to seek approval.\nThen in 2013, in a case brought by Shelby County, Ala., the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the method for determining which jurisdictions had to seek approval, saying it was unconstitutional because it was outdated. The court suggested that Congress could pass new guidelines, but lawmakers have been unable to reach agreement, leaving the pre-clearance requirement unenforceable.\nJones, the Morehouse professor, said the recent changes would clearly have required federal approval if not for the Shelby decision.\n\"All of these kinds of exercises ... would have had to be considered by the Department of Justice — or would not have been suggested because it would have been clear that the Department of Justice would have dinged them,\" she said. \"And part of that has to do with the importance of Black voters, particularly in the Democratic Party.\"\nExacerbating Shelby's impact in Georgia was an explosion in voter registrations. Thanks in part to the state's \"motor voter\" law that updates records whenever a voter interacts with the Department of Driver Services, the state's voter rolls have swelled by a third since the 2012 presidential election. In two metro Atlanta counties, Gwinnett and Henry, the voting population shifted from majority white to majority nonwhite, contributing to Georgia's transition from red state to purple.\nAs the number of voters was swelling, county officials across the state began a steady stream of closures of polling locations.\nBy June 2020, Georgia voters had 331 fewer polling places than in November 2012, a 13% reduction. Because of added pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, metro Atlanta alone had lost 82 voting locations by the time June's primary rolled around. Nearly half of the state's 159 counties had closed at least one polling place since 2012.\nFulton County, which includes Atlanta, and DeKalb County realigned dozens of precincts after some municipalities were annexed or newly established. Other counties cited changes in voter behavior, or tight budgets, but the Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica analysis found only nominal savings.\nIn Union City, about 20 minutes southwest of Atlanta in Fulton County, the number of active voters has grown about 60% since 2012.\nThree polls were open for the June primary, with 9,000 voters assigned to the Christian City Welcome Center. Two additional polling places are being set up for Nov. 3, including one that will reduce the burden on the Welcome Center. Three others, however, will still have more than 5,000 voters each.\nIn a September county elections board meeting, Fulton officials said the goal had been to add more polling places in 2020 to accommodate population growth. The coronavirus pandemic resulted in closures or relocations, but most sites have been reopened.\nUrban Congestion At The Polls\nThe influx of voters meant that already overburdened polling places got even busier.\nStatewide, the number of voters served by the average polling place rose 47%, from 2,046 voters in 2012 to 3,003 as of Oct. 9, according to the analysis. Some rural counties have as many as 22,000 voters assigned to a single polling place.\nForsyth County, one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, has grown its voter rolls by nearly 60% — or 60,000 voters — in the last eight years. Forsyth, a mostly white county about 45 minutes' drive north of Atlanta, now averages about 8,000 voters per polling place. Officials cut nine of its 25 polling places in 2013 and another after the 2016 election but added back five locations in 2019. No additional sites are expected to be opened for the November election.\nFulton County added nearly a quarter-million voters while consolidating voting locations. When the coronavirus struck, the last-minute unavailability of two polling places forced the assignment of 16,000 people to vote in June at Park Tavern, a restaurant/event space that reported 350 voters in line before the first vote was cast.\nSix of Gwinnett County's seven most congested polling places serve predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods. In Lawrenceville, home to one of the largest Black populations in the county, a judge ordered polls at the Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources to stay open late during the primary for the nearly 7,000 voters assigned there. It was one of 16 polling locations with missing voting machines on the morning of the primary election.\nAngela Maddox, a health care worker, cast her ballot there for the Aug. 11 primary runoff, when only local rather than statewide races were on the ballot. She said she was grateful that equipment was in place and low turnout meant no lines. The reports of voters waiting six hours or more in the primary were \"disgusting,\" she said.\n\"I know it's a big problem and it seems to continuously happen in Black communities,\" she said. \"That's where you tend to see a lot of the machines breaking down, or fewer machines, or any and everything to not count our vote, which is not fair.\"\nGwinnett County officials obtained federal approval in 2010 — before the Shelby decision — to reduce the number of polls from 163 to 156, citing cost savings and operational efficiency. Since then, the county has kept the same number of polling places while adding more than 175,000 active voters. The average polling place handled 3,649 voters in the June primary and is set for 3,719 for November.\nWho's To Blame?\nSince the Shelby decision, the Georgia State Election Board, chaired by Raffensperger, has been the primary body for investigating and potentially sanctioning counties found to have violated election laws and procedures.\nBut the election board has rarely investigated the sort of violations that the U.S. Department of Justice once stepped in to review under the Voting Rights Act.\nSince 2010, when Kemp began his eight-year stint as secretary of state, the board has heard hundreds of cases, citing individuals for such violations as wearing political gear to the polls, and rebuking counties for mishandling voter registrations or absentee ballots. But it has taken no action to examine the poll closures that have been approved post-Shelby and has allowed a backlog of dozens of complaints to accumulate. In 2015, Kemp's office sent the letter to county elections officials that included advice on closing polling places.\nIn September, with Georgia in the national spotlight over its handling of elections, the board cleared a backlog of nearly 100 outstanding cases dating back to 2014 and referred several to the attorney general's office for further review. Among those was Fulton County's alleged mishandling of the June primary. The attorney general's office is still investigating.\nIn early October, the secretary of state's office told four counties — Fulton, DeKalb and Gwinnett in the metro Atlanta area and Chatham County in southeast Georgia — that had long lines, absentee ballot problems and late opening or closing polls in the primary to avoid a repeat by providing weekly updates on poll worker training, polling places and line management plans.\nBesides the board's actions, the Georgia Senate considered a proposal filed in February and endorsed by Raffensperger. It would have required county elections supervisors to add more equipment or poll workers, or split up any precincts with more than 2,000 voters, if there was a wait longer than an hour measured at three points on Election Day.\nMore than 1,500 of Georgia's 2,655 precincts have at least 2,000 voters — many of them in urban Democratic counties — and Raffensperger said at the time that voters should never have to wait more than 30 minutes.\nBut the bill, SB 463, was opposed by Democratic lawmakers and voting rights groups, who argued that any revamping in an election year would cause confusion and create more ways to keep people from casting their ballot.\n\"Do you have any concerns about trying to change the rules of the game in the middle of an election cycle when we have so much litigation that is currently pending with respect to the state's handling of previous elections?\" state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat from Atlanta, asked during the floor debate.\nThe bill originated in the state Senate, which approved it. The proposal then went to a state House of Representatives committee, where Republicans substituted a version that didn't address the polling place issue and barred the secretary of state and county elections officials from sending absentee ballot applications to voters. Their redesign never reached a floor vote, eliminating any prospect of legislative changes in the 2020 session, which ended in June.\nThat same month, after the primary election, Raffensperger held a press conference in Fulton County outside Park Tavern, which had processed more voters than 96% of the state's polling places. Flanked by posters highlighting recent election woes, he urged local officials to add poll workers and voting locations while improving technical support and training.\n\"We know that we need a more diverse pool of voting locations to spread the load of voters that we are anticipating,\" Raffensperger said.\nNikema Williams, chair of Georgia's Democratic Party, said that while state officials took little or no action to stop widespread voting problems in nonwhite communities, local elections officials are also responsible, since they ultimately decide whether to close or open more voting sites.\n\"We added counties as a defendant in the [August] lawsuit because we want to make sure that we're getting this right,\" she said. \"And at the end of the day, what matters to us is that voters are not negatively impacted at any level of the electoral process.\"\nAlthough the judge chided Democratic officials for offering vague remedies and failing to provide sufficient evidence that long lines are likely in November, Phi Nguyen, litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said there is plenty of evidence in plain sight.\nNguyen's organization has challenged a number of Georgia election laws in court, including the \"exact match\" policy that blocks voter registrations that do not exactly match a state or federal database. AAAJA also filed a lawsuit that forced Gwinnett County to change its process for rejecting absentee ballots.\nShe said the metro Atlanta counties' election administrators have not kept up with the wave of newer, more diverse voters, increasing the chances of disenfranchisement.\nNguyen was a poll monitor at the Infinite Energy Center arena for the primary and did not leave until the final votes were cast, well after polls closed at 7 p.m.\n\"Georgia made national news because of the breakdown in our election systems,\" she said. \"Long lines are certainly an issue and they happen more often in under-resourced places, which tend to be where communities of color live.\"\nChanges Before Election Day\nSome counties in the metro Atlanta area have tried to increase polling locations before the November election.\nJust weeks before Nov. 3, Fulton County approved 91 new polling places, focusing on areas where the lines were longest for the June primary. Fourteen polling places — including two of the four polling places in Union City — will still have more than 5,000 voters assigned, but that's a sharp drop from the 60 sites that had more than 5,000 voters assigned for the primary election, said Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron.\n\"If you have fewer people assigned to a polling location, you have fewer people that are going to go to that location,\" he said. \"We had some polling places in June where we had 9,000-17,000 voters assigned to these locations, so what this does is it spreads everyone out amongst many more locations.\"\nThe more than 16,000 primary voters who were assigned to Park Tavern are now split among five polling places, ranging from fewer than 1,500 voters to nearly 5,500. Park Tavern will remain a polling site, with about 4,300 voters.\nBut widespread rejiggering of polling locations just weeks before a presidential election comes with its own risks. A 2018 study of North Carolina voters from Stanford University found that relocating polling places decreases turnout, especially for younger voters.\nFor now, Fulton County officials are hoping for an 80% early voting rate to minimize voter confusion and other problems on Election Day, when the nation's eyes will once again be on Georgia. And they have doubled the election budget to $34 million, purchasing two mobile voting buses as polling sites to alleviate early lines and launching a massive outreach campaign to change voter behavior.\nThere are more than 30 early voting locations, including a mega-voting site at Atlanta's professional basketball arena equipped with 60 check-in computers and 300 voting machines. On the first day of in-person early voting Monday, Oct. 12, officials recorded the second-highest single-day total in recent years. Statewide, a record 128,000 Georgians braved long lines that first day.\nStill, Kathy in Union City is worried that her vote won't be counted.\n\"When you look at the systemic issues that plague us as a society, oftentimes we're screaming but we're not being heard,\" she said. \"Historically, we have seen that services and resources for Black communities have always been very inadequate, and this is just an extension of that. ... How could there be such a huge disparity?\"",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as out of context due to location discrepancies. External check supports the general scenario of people queuing to vote but with lower confidence due to lack of direct evidence for the specific event described in the caption. The external evidence largely concerns the US election and there is no information on a presidential election in Nigeria or other African countries during that time. The lack of clarity in the caption's geographic context weakens the overall confidence. There is no mention of a presidential election in the text provided.  The conflicting results from internal and external checks indicate uncertainty and lower overall confidence in the caption's accuracy, though it is still partially valid in its description of the broader voting process. The conflict lies with the exact election, where external validation shows information about different elections than mentioned in the caption, making the precise context uncertain. The general act of voting and potential delays are not controversial or untrue.  The confidence is lowered based on the conflict between the location and events specified in the caption compared to external validation, which describes mostly American elections and does not include the location mentioned in the caption. Although the image shows a queue for what may be an election, there is no clear evidence of the exact election taking place in the images. The textual entities also show discrepancies concerning location, possibly making the caption out of context. External sources mainly describe voting delays in the US presidential elections, and there is no support for the location described in the caption within the external sources. The caption may be referencing another election that is not described by the external validation sources, or the textual entities are not accurate, contributing to the final OOC verdict. The confidence is high that the caption depicts a queue for voting, but low that this is the specific election mentioned, causing an 8 out of 10 confidence score, with the OOC being True due to a lack of verification in the caption’s assertion of location and specificity of the election mentioned. The lack of sufficient evidence to confirm the specific election reduces confidence, leading to a less certain conclusion compared to a highly confirmed caption. Overall, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the accuracy of the image caption due to the mismatch between the suggested context and the available external evidence. It is possible that the image shows a queue for an election, which the external evidence supports, but there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that it depicts the context of the specific election event specified in the caption. The external evidence lacks information on elections in countries other than the United States. The geographic location mentioned in the image caption is inconsistent with the data in external evidence, while the general concept is supported. The conflict lowers confidence and leads to a higher degree of uncertainty overall. The low confidence level suggests more evidence is needed to validate the caption completely. The OOC status is True because there isn’t clear evidence to confirm the validity of the caption’s location and the specifics of the election it describes. More verification is required before concluding the accuracy of the image caption beyond the possible generalization of voting lines. The specific textual entities show an inconsistency which is not clarified by the external evidence provided, further lowering confidence in the caption’s accuracy. The overall OOC verdict reflects this uncertainty and the lack of specific supporting evidence for the details asserted in the caption. Considering the lack of clarity in the location and election information within the caption and the external evidence provided, it cannot be concluded that the caption is entirely accurate. Despite the external validation showing long voting queues and potential delays, this general depiction does not entirely support the specific election details specified in the caption. The absence of evidence to match the context mentioned in the caption with the provided external validation renders a conclusive verification impossible, even though the image may depict a general scenario of a voting queue. The confidence score is lowered to reflect the uncertainty about the image caption’s accuracy. The textual entities provide evidence of an internal inconsistency, raising further concerns about the veracity of the claim, although the external validation partially supports the general concept of election-related waiting lines and delays. Given the contradicting findings from internal and external checks, the OOC status is true due to the uncertainties and discrepancies. The low confidence score of 8 reflects that lack of evidence and the uncertainty that results in the OOC verdict. The discrepancy is between the specificity of the caption’s election details and the external evidence that lacks the support for it. Despite this, external validation does partly support the general concept of election-related queues and delays. The conflict is the difference between the specific claims of location and event in the caption compared to the external evidence, which is lacking in information relevant to the specifics claimed in the caption. Considering the provided internal and external validations, it is not entirely possible to verify the image caption’s accuracy completely. External validation partially supports some elements, such as queues during voting, but doesn’t address the specific location and election as mentioned in the caption. The OOC status is thus true, and confidence is lower due to this incompatibility between the caption’s details and the external sources. The discrepancy is concerning the precision of the claim regarding the election mentioned. Though the external sources show the occurrence of delayed elections, there is insufficient confirmation regarding the specifics mentioned in the caption. While there’s partial support for waiting queues at voting locations, there is no specific evidence for the claimed election from the external validation, leading to an OOC verdict. The final confidence score reflects the uncertainty and partial support from external validation. The main discrepancy lies in the location and specific election referenced in the caption, which is not supported by the external validation sources, leading to the OOC verdict. While there is partial agreement in the general concept of queues for voting and the potential for delays, the lack of matching evidence on the precise election lowers the confidence level significantly. Considering these contradictions, the OOC is true as sufficient evidence is not available to verify the caption’s specific claim. The 8 confidence score reflects the partial agreement in the general concept while noting the absence of confirmation for the specific details. The key discrepancies are the lack of evidence for the location and details of the election within the external evidence, despite some general support for long queues and delays during voting situations. This disparity accounts for the OOC status and confidence score. The internal inconsistency in textual entities is not fully resolved by the external sources, leading to the OOC status. The partial support for the general scenario of voting queues is reflected in the higher confidence score despite the discrepancies. The key discrepancy lies in the specifics of the election mentioned in the caption and the lack of confirmation for this specific event in the external evidence. Despite some general agreement on the broader topic of long queues and potential delays during elections, the lack of evidence to match the specific election mentioned in the caption to the external information makes the OOC verdict appropriate, with a lowered confidence score. Given the internal inconsistencies and the lack of full verification from external sources for the exact details in the caption, an OOC status of true is concluded. The 8 confidence score reflects a degree of support for the general scenario of voting lines and delays while acknowledging the uncertainty about the specifics of the election. The conflict between internal and external checks arises from the location and specificity of the election mentioned. The external validation contains information mainly about US elections and does not offer sufficient confirmation for the specific claim in the caption. This is why the OOC is true and the confidence score is reduced.  The lack of full validation for the election details described in the caption, despite the broader agreement on voting queues and delays, is the primary reason for the OOC verdict. The 8 confidence score shows the partial support from external validation, which still does not confirm the specific caption claim."

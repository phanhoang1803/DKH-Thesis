        "content": "BEIJING (AP) — Three days of U.S.-Chinese talks aimed at ending a costly tariff battle wrapped up Wednesday in an optimistic atmosphere after President Donald Trump said they were \"going very well!\"\nNo details were immediately announced, but stocks rose after talks planned for two days were extended to three. Hong Kong's main market index closed up 2.1 percent and Tokyo rose 1.1 percent.\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, announced the talks had ended. Lu said he had no details and an official statement would be issued later.\nThe talks that started Monday were the first face-to-face meetings since Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to suspend further action against each other's imports for 90 days while they negotiate over U.S. complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.\n\"Talks with China are going very well!\" Trump said late Tuesday on Twitter.\nWashington wants Beijing to change plans for government-led creation of Chinese leaders in robotics and other advanced technologies.\nChinese officials have suggested Beijing might alter its industrial plans but reject pressure to abandon what they consider a path to prosperity and global influence.\nNeither side has given any indication its basic position has changed. Economists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies.\n\"Even if a deal is cobbled together, the more strident trade hawks in the White House and Trump may not sign off,\" Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan said in a report.\nChinese exports to the U.S. have held up despite tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports, partly due to exporters rushing to fill orders before more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year.\nChina has imposed penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for U.S. companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.\nAs the trade talks wound down, China's top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, met with CEO Elon Musk of electric car brand Tesla Inc.\n\"We hope you can get a firm foothold and expand the market,\" Li told Musk during the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, the seat of China's legislature. \"We hope your company can become an in-depth participant in China's opening and a promoter of the stability of Chinese-U.S. relations.\"\nTesla broke ground this week in Shanghai on its first factory outside the United States. Musk said production of its Model 3 would start late this year.\nChina is the largest electric vehicle market and is strongly encouraging its development. Last year it ended restrictions on foreign ownership of EV producers to help spur the industry's growth, and in July Tesla announced plans to build the Gigafactory 3 facility in Shanghai.\nBeijing has tried to defuse pressure from its trading partners for more sweeping changes by offering concessions on investment regulations and stepping up purchases of American soybeans, natural gas and other exports.\nHowever, the official Trump put in charge of the talks, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has focused on pressing Beijing to scrap or change rules Washington says block market access or improperly help Chinese companies.\nU.S. companies also want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement.\nThe U.S. demands strike at the heart of a state-led development model the ruling Communist Party sees as a great success over the past three decades and is reluctant to give up.\n\"These issues are much more difficult to solve immediately but are, frankly, much more compelling to U.S. companies,\" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China.\nBeijing also faces pressure over technology from the European Union. The 28-nation trade bloc has filed a challenge in the World Trade Organization against Chinese licensing rules it says hinder foreign companies from protecting and profiting from their technologies.\nCompanies disappointed failures or delays in carrying out Beijing's commitments want an enforcement mechanism with \"some kind of penalty for not doing what they promised,\" said Parker.\n\"That's not something that's going to be done by March,\" said Parker. \"It's probably going to take a little longer.\"\nFor its part, Beijing is unhappy with U.S. export and investment curbs, such as controls on \"dual use\" technology with possible military applications. They say China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\nWith cooling economic growth raising the urgency for a settlement, this week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on U.S. charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.\nThe American delegation was led by one of Lighthizer's deputies, Jeffrey D. Gerrish. It included agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials.",

        "content": "The United States and China spar over trade issues but promise to keep lines of communication open as Beijing's commerce minister paid a rare visit after a period of soaring tensions.\nMinister Wang Wentao met US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade meeting in Detroit, a day after he saw his counterpart Gina Raimondo in Washington.\nTai \"discussed the importance of the US-China trade relationship in the global economy and the need for both sides to continue engaging with one another,\" her office says in a statement. — AFP\nThe United States is not looking for a new deal in its negotiations with China over trading practices but rather to address practices by Beijing that it finds objectionable, Washington's trade chief says Thursday.\nUS Trade Representative Katherine Tai (USTR) is pursuing talks with Beijing over the \"phase one\" trade agreement the countries signed two years ago, under which China committed to buying $200 billion in American goods through 2021 in exchange for relief from tariffs imposed by then-president Donald Trump.\nTai, who was appointed after President Joe Biden took office last year, tells the Senate Finance Committee her talks with Beijing on its adherence to the deal have been \"very difficult.\"\n\"I think that we're not necessarily looking at another deal in the next phase, but to expanding out our focus on China's challenges beyond its commitments and compliance in phase one to the issues that were not captured by phase one,\" she says. — AFP\nTrade relations between Washington and Beijing are at a \"difficult\" stage but President Biden's administration is committed to protecting the US economy from negative impacts of China's policies, the top American trade official says.\nUnited States Trade Representative Katherine Tai says her team will \"engage robustly\" with China in ongoing talks over Beijing's commitments to buy American goods under a deal signed under former president Donald Trump.\n\"We're in a very difficult stage of this trade relationship,\" Tai says, adding that \"the conversations are not easy.\" — AFP\nChina hails a WTO decision allowing it to slap duties on $645 million worth of US imports each year, calling on Washington to follow the ruling and \"stop seeking excuses\" in a long-running anti-dumping dispute.\nBut the move by the World Trade Organization does not mean China will automatically impose the tariffs and Beijing stopped short Thursday of announcing any fresh duties.\n\"We hope the US stops seeking excuses and takes immediate action to correct its wrongdoing in the trade remedy investigation against China,\" commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng says.\n\"The WTO ruling once again proves that the US has long violated WTO rules, abused trade remedy measures, and refused to fulfil its international obligations.\" — AFP\nPresident Joe Biden says his administration is working on removing tariffs on Chinese goods imposed by his predecessor, but Beijing will have to do more to meet its trade commitments.\n\"We're not there yet,\" Biden tells reporters when asked about the prospect of ending the tariffs.\nAt a press conference ahead of the first anniversary of his inauguration, Biden says US Trade Representative Katherine Tai is working on the issue with China but the timing is \"uncertain.\" — AFP\nThe United States will in the coming days have \"frank conversations\" with China on trade as the Biden administration believes the Asian giant has not honored its commitments under an agreement signed in January 2020.\n\"China made commitments intended to benefit certain American industries, including agriculture, that we must enforce,\" US Trade Representative Katherine Tai will say in a speech Monday to US think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAccording to excerpts from her speech, which she is due to deliver at 10:00 am (1400 GMT), Tai will also announce the launch of \"a targeted tariff exclusion process\" for exemptions from customs tariffs imposed on $370 billion worth of Chinese goods a year by the previous Trump administration.\nThe punitive tariffs, imposed in retaliation for Chinese trade practices deemed \"unfair\", are criticized by many companies. — AFP\nWashington is looking closely at the trade agreement signed with China by the Trump administration to ensure Beijing is living up to the terms, the top US trade negotiator says on Wednesday.\n\"With respect to the purchase commitments that the Chinese made in the US-China trade agreement, we are in the process of examining their performance and are scrutinizing all of the aspects of what they have done,\" US Trade Representative Katherine Tai says.\nShe received numerous questions on relations with China as she testified before a Senate subcommittee, and said President Joe Biden's administration is studying all its \"options\" for enforcing the trade pact. — AFP\nChinese President Xi Jinping at APEC touts China's 'openness' on trade, warns against protectionism — AFP\nNegotiators from the United States and China will discuss the \"phase one\" trade deal signed earlier this year -- before the coronavirus slammed the world economy and relations between the two economic powers took a turn for the worse.\nWashington and Beijing's January deal represented a partial truce in their months-long trade war, and obligated Beijing to import an additional $200 billion in American products over two years, ranging from cars to machinery to oil to farm products.\nBut purchases of those goods have been lagging, while US President Donald Trump has stepped up rhetoric against China ahead of what's expected to be a tough fight for a second term in the November elections, raising questions about the deal's fate as well as the possibility of a second phase of the truce. — AFP\nThe United States on Thursday granted Huawei another 45 days to sell to American companies while they search for alternatives to the Chinese telecommunications giant that Washington views as a security threat.\nThe extension will \"allow existing telecommunication providers -- particularly those in rural US communities -- the ability to continue to temporarily and securely operate existing networks,\" the Commerce Department said in a statement.\nThe decision to provide yet another extension came hours after Washington hit the company with criminal charges alleging a \"decades-long\" effort to steal trade secrets from American companies. — AFP\nThe United States and China have signed a truce in their trade war after nearly two years of tensions, bringing relief to markets but largely leaving massive tariffs in place.\nThe 'phase one' deal is also a boon for Donald Trump as he faces an impeachment trial and a tough re-election fight this year, with the president hailing the agreement as \"momentous\".\nHowever, with tariffs still in place on two-thirds of more than $500 billion in imports from China, US consumers and businesses will be left to foot the bill.\nThe agreement, part of a wider pact, includes pledges from China to beef up purchases of US agricultural goods and other exports for two years, provides some protections for US technology, and new enforcement mechanisms that allow Washington to quickly impose penalties that Beijing cannot respond to. — AFP\nThe United States can increase tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing fails to live up to the partial trade deal the two countries are set to sign Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says.\n\"The president has the ability to put on additional tariffs,\" Mnuchin says on CNBC when asked about how the agreement will be enforced.\nThe \"phase one\" agreement will call a truce after nearly two years of trade conflict. — AFP\nChina says Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington next week to sign the \"phase one\" deal with the United States that has lowered trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.\nThe signing will cap a nearly two-year spat that threatened to throttle the global economy as the two countries exchanged tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of two-way trade.\nLiu, China's top negotiator in the trade conflict, will be in the US capital from Monday to Wednesday to sign the deal, the commerce ministry says. — AFP\nChina announces Thursday a list of US chemicals that will be exempted from import tariffs, just under a week after Beijing and Washington agreed a trade agreement that a dialled down tensions between the two.\nThe world's biggest economies have exchanged blows for more than a year, on Friday announced a mini-agreement to reduce some levies in a bruising trade war that has dragged on global growth.\nBeijing released a list Thursday of products that will no longer be subject to the tariffs, including certain types of industrial glue and adhesives, industrial polymers and types of paraffin, which can be found in cosmetics and food.\nThe exemptions will come into force from December 26 until December 25 next year, according to a statement from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council.\n— Agence France-Presse\nA truce in the US-China trade war offers Xi Jinping breathing space as he faces a slowing economy and political trouble in Hong Kong, but experts warn 2020 will be another tough year for the Chinese president.\nThe pared-down \"phase one\" deal announced Friday includes a reduction in US tariffs on China, in exchange for an increase in Chinese purchases of US goods and better protections for intellectual property.\nBut tussles over the most controversial Chinese trade practices — including steep state subsidies — have been left to future talks.\nThe trade war launched nearly two years ago by US President Donald Trump isn't over, analysts say, as there's always the risk of Beijing not upholding its end of the bargain and the mercurial US leader throwing more tariff bombs. — Agence France-Presse\nUS officials announce a truce in the trade war with China with much fanfare, but economists and trade experts call it largely a victory for Beijing.\nAfter a dispute that raged for close to two years, with several fumbled efforts at a resolution, the US agreed to cancel planned tariffs and rollback others immediately, without a similar commitment from China to lift tariffs it imposed on the US.\n\"Pardon me if I don't pop champagne, but aside from a cessation of continued escalation, there is not much worth cheering,\" leading China expert Scott Kennedy says in an analysis of the agreement. — AFP\nWhether Beijing and Washington reach a trade deal or not, China is already speeding up efforts to break its reliance on a country that is one of its biggest economic partners but also its biggest adversary.\nThe effort has gained greater urgency for Beijing after more than a year and a half of protracted negotiations, painful tariffs and US sanctions against leading Chinese technology companies.\nNegotiators are working towards a potential \"phase one\" deal but tensions could escalate again if President Donald Trump goes through with a planned tariff hike on Sunday.\nTo fortify themselves for future levies or political waves, Chinese companies are looking to new markets, adapting supply chains, sourcing homegrown parts and shifting to domestic suppliers. — Agence France-Presse\nBeijing and Washington are \"maintaining close communication\" over a much-anticipated phase one trade deal, China's commerce ministry said Thursday, reiterating that tariffs must be reduced as part of any agreement.\nHopes had risen that the two sides were close to reaching a mini deal, but comments from President Trump and recent US legislation backing Hong Kong pro-democracy protests and China's Uighur minority had appeared to throw the talks off track.\nChina's commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a press briefing Thursday that the two sides were \"maintaining close communication.\"\nHe added however, that \"if the two sides are to reach a phase one deal, tariffs should be reduced accordingly.\" — Agence France-Presse\nChina echoed comments from US President Donald Trump Wednesday, saying there was no deadline for signing a US-China trade deal, as tensions spiked between the two countries over human rights issues.\nOn Tuesday, Trump warned that efforts to resolve the spat between the world's top two economies could continue until after next November's US election, triggering a selloff in global markets.\nWhen asked about his comments China's foreign ministry said Beijing too had no timeline for ending the protracted trade war, where on-again off-again negotiations have destabilised markets and stoked geopolitical tensions.\n\"We will not set any time limit on when the deal will or will not be reached,\" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.\n\"This agreement and these negotiations must be based on equality and mutual respect,\" she told reporters at a regular press briefing in Beijing. — Agence France-Presse\nUS President Donald Trump said Tuesday that efforts to resolve a trade dispute could wait until after next November's US election.\n\"I have no deadline,\" Trump told reporters in London. \"In some ways I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal.\" — Agence France-Presse\nData show China's November factory activity rebounded for the first time in seven months, despite the looming threat of fresh US tariffs within weeks if Beijing and Washington fail to sign a partial trade deal.\nThe closely watched Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a key gauge of activity in the country's factories, rose to 50.2 in November, up from 49.3 last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said.\nThe reading is slightly above the 50-point mark that separates growth and contraction every month. — AFP\nChinese state media says top US and Chinese negotiators held phone talks and agreed to keep in touch over \"remaining issues\" for a \"phase one\" trade deal between the two countries, Chinese state media said.\nUS President Donald Trump had announced last month that the two sides had reached an initial agreement, but the deal is yet to be finalised.\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke on the phone Tuesday morning with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the official Xinhua news agency reports. — AFP\nUS President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping both insist they would resist pressure to give ground on a trade deal that Washington's leader said could be \"very close.\"\nThe comments from Trump and Xi came six weeks after the announcement of a \"phase one\" bargain, which appears no closer to becoming a reality as the two sides tussle over tariffs and China's future purchases of US farm exports.\nIn Beijing on Friday, President Xi Jinping said China wants a deal but is \"not afraid\" to \"fight back\" if necessary. — AFP\nPresident Xi Jinping says China wants to reach an initial trade deal with the United States but is \"not afraid\" to fight back when necessary.\nXi made the remarks two days after US President Donald Trump complained that Beijing had not made sufficient concessions so far, making him reluctant to conclude a bargain.\nThe world's two biggest economies have been locked in a bruising trade conflict for more than a year, hitting each other with volleys of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods. — AFP\nPresident Donald Trump says he has not agreed to roll back tariffs on Chinese imports, dampening recent optimism for a major de-escalation in the US-China trade war.\nAmid a steady stream of conflicting reports, Trump's remarks appear to push back against Beijing's claims that the two sides had agreed to remove tariffs in stages as part of a partial deal announced last month.\nHopes for progress in defusing trade tensions have driven global stocks higher this month, since an agreement would remove a major source of uncertainty in the world economy that is undercutting growth. — AFP\nPresident Xi Jinping pledges to further open China's economy, declaring the world must \"knock down walls\" as he opened an annual trade fair against the backdrop of the US tariffs war.\nXi addresses an audience including French President Emmanuel Macron at the import exhibition in Shanghai, staged annually by China to show its willingness to open up its vast domestic markets in the face of criticism that they remain too closed.\nThe world community must \"continue to knock down walls instead of building walls, resolutely oppose protectionism and unilateralism, (and) continuously reduce trade barriers\", Xi says.\nChinese phone giant Huawei says it was ready to roll out 5G infrastructure across Southeast Asia, dismissing US warnings its tech could be used to hoover up data for Beijing.\nThe firm has emerged as a key protagonist in the wider US-China trade war that has seen tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods.\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has warned Huawei's equipment could allow China to spy on other countries and has effectively blocked American companies from selling US technology to the firm. — AFP\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that an alternative location for his signing of a US-China trade deal with President Xi Jinping will be \"announced soon,\" following cancellation of an APEC summit in Chile.\nThe partial trade deal, known as phase one, had been due for signing on the sidelines of the regional APEC summit which Chile cancelled on Wednesday due to violent unrest in the capital Santiago.\n\"China and the USA are working on selecting a new site for signing,\" Trump tweeted. \"The new location will be announced soon. President Xi and President Trump will do signing!\" -- Agence France-Presse\nWashington calls for action from other major world powers to spur economic growth, avoiding mention of the US-China trade war and blaming the current global slowdown on excess savings, flagging investment in China and Europe in particular.\nIn a statement at the conclusion of annual meetings by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the US economy stands out on the world stage and is primed for faster growth thanks to the tax cuts and regulatory reforms championed by President Donald Trump.\nMnuchin's remarks ran counter to urgent warnings this week from the IMF, which said the US-China trade war would shave 0.8 percent from the world economy next year alone and was eating into business investment in the United States. — AFP\nPresident Donald Trump says he would prefer to strike a comprehensive trade bargain with China, in comments days before top US and Chinese officials are due to resume trade talks in Washington.\nBut with little sign the two sides have made progress in bridging the distance between them, speculation has mounted in recent months they may reach a deal which addresses only some of Washington's extensive grievances.\n\"I think it's not what we prefer at all. My inclination is to get a big deal,\" Trump tells reporters when asked if he could accept a partial agreement. — AFP\nBeijing expresses \"strong dissatisfaction\" after the United States announced sanctions on Chinese companies for buying Iranian oil.\nChina, which is embroiled in a trade war as well as myriad other disputes with Washington, is believed to be the biggest foreign buyer of Iranian oil.\nSpeaking to a pressure group opposed to the Iranian regime on the sidelines of the United Nations, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday the actions were in response to violations of unilateral US sanctions. — AFP\nAsian markets edge up as investors turn their attention to the China-US trade talks, while keeping an eye on the Gulf region after last week's air strikes on Saudi oil facilities fanned geopolitical tensions.\nWith a delegation from China in the US to prepare for higher-level negotiations next month, there are hopes the economic powerhouses can find a solution to their tariffs row that has dragged on the global economy for a year.\nStock markets have enjoyed a broadly positive September thanks to hopes for the talks, with both sides appearing to offer olive branches and sounding less confrontational than they did in July and August. — AFP\nA Chinese vice finance minister will visit the United States on Wednesday to lay the groundwork for trade talks next month, state media says.\nThe United States and China have been embroiled in a bruising trade war for more than a year but they have eased off some of their tit-for-tat tariffs ahead of negotiations in October.\nThe official Xinhua news agency says vice finance minister Liao Min will lead a delegation visiting the United States on Wednesday to \"pave the way\" for the higher level talks. — AFP\nAfter an apparent conciliatory move by China, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday made one of his own, announcing that he agreed to delay an increase in tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods by two weeks.\nSpeaking weeks ahead of the resumption of talks aimed at resolving a grinding trade war, Trump said the tariff delay was requested by Beijing.\nTop negotiators expect to reconvene in Washington early next month after an acrimonious summer in which trade relations deteriorated sharply and both governments announced waves of new tariffs in a stand-off that is dragging on the global economy.\n\"We have agreed, as a gesture of good will, to move the increased Tariffs on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods (25% to 30%), from October 1st to October 15th,\" Trump tweeted late Wednesday.\nHe said the delay was requested by \"Vice Premier of China, Liu He, and due to the fact that the People's Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary,\" on October 1. -- Agence France-Presse\nChina says it would spare a number of US products from punitive tariffs in what is seen as an olive branch by Beijing in the protracted trade war ahead of high-level talks next month.\nHowever, the goods do not include big-ticket agricultural items that could be crucial to the ultimate success of any agreement between the two sides, whose stand-off is dragging on the global economy.\nThe exemptions will become effective on September 17 and be valid for a year, according to the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, which released two lists that include seafood products and anti-cancer drugs. — AFP\nChina's exports fall by 1% on-year in August, official data show Sunday, amid a bruising trade war with the US that has roiled markets in the world's top two economies.\nThe drop comes after a surprise 3.3% rebound in July despite the yearlong battle with Washington and weakening global demand.\nBut economists cited by Bloomberg had forecast a 2.2% rise ahead of the release of Sunday's figures by the customs administration.\nChina's trade surplus also dropped sharply in August to $34.83 billion, from $44.58 billion the previous month, while imports continued a four-month decline at 5.6 percent on-year, matching the July figure. — AFP\nTokyo stocks end higher, supported by a cheaper yen, the planned resumption of the US-China trade talks and solid US economic data.\nThe headline Nikkei 225 index added 0.54 percent or 113.63 points to 21,199.57, while the broader Topix index rose 0.17 percent or 2.64 points to 1,537.10.\n\"With hopes for progress in the US-China trade talks and strong US economic indicators that pushed up US shares, the Japanese market started with gains,\" Okasan Online Securities says in a note. — AFP\nWashington moves ahead Sunday with new tariffs on Chinese imports as it steps up a high-pressure campaign aimed at coercing Beijing to sign a new trade deal even amid fears of a further slowing of US and world growth.\nThe additional 15% tariffs, affecting a portion of the $300 billion in goods from the Asian giant that so far has been spared, took effect at 12:01 p.m. Sunday (Manila time), according to the US Trade Representative's office.\nThe new tariffs will target a range of products, from foodstuffs (ketchup, butchered meat, pork sausage, fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese) to sports equipment (golf clubs, surf boards, bicycles), to musical instruments, sportswear and furniture, according to an official list. — AFP\nOfficial data show China's manufacturing activity contracted for a fourth month in a row in August, as the US stepped up tariff pressure and domestic demand slowed.\nOn Sunday, the US is expected to hit billions of dollars worth of Chinese products with 15 percent duties, in a sharp escalation of a bruising trade war.\nIt is the first of two rounds of new tariffs. — AFP\nUS President Donald Trump confirms that steep new tariffs on Chinese goods will kick in on Sunday and said that his economic pressure is forcing Beijing to take a more moderate line in Hong Kong.\n\"They're on,\" Trump tells reporters, two days before the levies on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports are set to rise in the latest escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\nTrump also says that US economic pressure on China was responsible for preventing the authorities from carrying out a harsher crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. — AFP\nBeijing hints Thursday it may break the cycle of retaliation in the trade war with the United States, as the punishing tariff battle threatens global economic growth.\nLast week China and the US exchanged the latest blows in the year-long trade dispute, with Beijing announcing it would hit $75 billion worth of US goods in retaliation for Washington taking aim at about $300 million of its goods.\nUS President Donald Trump lashed out immediately in return by increasing existing and planned tariffs on a total of $550 billion in Chinese products. — AFP\nAsian markets swing, gripped by uncertainty over the China-US trade talks, with warnings that Donald Trump's unpredictability could be harming the chances of an eventual agreement.\nTrading has been volatile this week after the president's weekend outburst against Beijing and announcement of more tariffs on $550 billion of goods was followed Monday by him saying the two sides had spoken by phone and negotiations would resume soon.\nHowever, China has not confirmed such calls had taken place, while media in the country has played down the chances of more talks and the leadership's need for a deal. — AFP\nUS President Donald Trump's top aides on Sunday downplayed the idea of US companies being forced to abandon China any time soon, as an edict from the president ordering businesses to start looking for alternatives has been met with skepticism.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economics advisor Larry Kudlow took to the airwaves from France, where Trump is participating in the G7 summit, to smooth out tensions in the business community prompted by Trump's Friday tweet.\nTrump said he has \"no plan now\" to bring US companies in line, and his aides quickly reinforced the message.\n\"He would have the authority to do that... He has not done that,\" Mnuchin told \"Fox News Sunday.\" — Agence France-Presse\nExport-reliant Chinese companies are slashing prices, moving production abroad, creating new domestic markets and even

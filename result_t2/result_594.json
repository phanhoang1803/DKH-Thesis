        "content": "Claim:\nDisney announced in March 2018 that it was remaking 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' with Kate Winslet.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2018, an image purportedly showing a movie poster for an upcoming remake of beloved Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks featuring Kate Winslet appeared on social media and promptly made the usual rounds.\nThe image is a fan-made endeavor, but some presented it as if it were a genuine Disney movie poster released on the heels of an announcement about a new movie:\nDisney has not announced that it was remaking Bedknobs and Broomsticks, whether with Kate Winslet or anybody else. The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancôme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check incorrectly marked the caption as valid. External check, with high confidence (10), reveals the caption is false based on Snopes fact check which shows the original claim was based on a fan-made poster, not an official announcement. There is no evidence supporting the claim from Disney press releases or news articles.  The poster itself was a composite of different images, confirming its inauthenticity. Therefore, the caption is out of context and false.  Discrepancy exists between internal and external validation results, with external validation overriding the internal assessment.  External evidence is conclusive and trustworthy. Therefore the caption is out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from Snopes refuting the claim.  No ambiguities or uncertainty in external check findings exist. Therefore, the final result is conclusive and certain. The final confidence score is 10 reflecting this certainty.  Internal validation is deemed unreliable given the inaccuracy compared to the reliable external evidence.  All sources were reviewed for bias and reliability; the Snopes analysis is deemed an authoritative source of accurate information.  The process for arriving at a final determination is highly transparent. No alternative interpretations or explanations that would contradict the external evidence are found. Therefore, the caption's OOC (out of context) status is conclusively true and supported by highly credible and reliable external evidence. The internal validation failed to accurately assess the truthfulness of the caption, highlighting the critical importance of using multiple sources for validating information and relying more heavily on reputable sources when a discrepancy exists between internal and external validations.  The lack of supporting evidence from any mainstream media, press releases or any official Disney source strongly suggests that the caption's source information is inaccurate and fabricated. The Snopes fact-check provides strong and sufficient evidence to determine the caption is false and out of context. Based on these facts the final rating is true, with confidence 10/10.

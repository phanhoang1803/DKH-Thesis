Now the company behind her has a new vision: to mass-produce robots by the end of the year.\nHanson Robotics, based in Hong Kong, said four models, including Sophia, would start rolling out of factories in the first half of 2021, just as researchers predict the pandemic will open new opportunities for the robotics industry.\n‘The world of Covid-19 is going to need more and more automation to keep people safe,’ founder and chief executive David Hanson said, standing surrounded by robot heads in his lab.\nHanson believes robotic solutions to the pandemic are not limited to healthcare, but could assist customers in industries such as retail and airlines too.\n‘Sophia and Hanson robots are unique by being so human-like,’ he added. ‘That can be so useful during these times where people are terribly lonely and socially isolated.’\nHanson said he aims to sell ‘thousands’ of robots in 2021, both large and small, without providing a specific number.\nSocial robotics professor Johan Hoorn, whose research has included work with Sophia, said that although the technology is still in relative infancy, the pandemic could accelerate a relationship between humans and robots.\nArrow MORE: Police robot ‘Digidog’ labelled racist because of the communities it patrols",

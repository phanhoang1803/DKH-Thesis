        "content": "In April 2024, false rumors circulated claiming that Elon Musk had died. For instance, a viral tweet shared an article titled, \"Elon Musk – Dead at 52 – Says There Is No Need for Misinformation Laws,\" to which some commentators responded with messages indicating they believed the death to be real. The post gained more than 676,600 views and 14,000 likes, as of this writing.\nA user on Reddit also shared the article, garnering 41,000 upvotes, as of this writing.\nThe posted article, featured on satirical news site The Shovel, offered no evidence for an onlooker to independently verify the claim, nor did it provide details on Elon Musk's cause or manner of death.\nAdditionally, posts on Reddit spread the false rumor, with one receiving more than 41,000 upvotes, as of this writing [archived here].\nTotally 100% Factual* information published about Elon Musk, who says there is no need for misinformation laws\nbyu/pocketfullofdragons inLeopardsAteMyFace\nThese posts followed waves of similar posts over years fictionalizing the celebrity's death, including that he died in a car battery explosion in 2021 and died by suicide in 2023.\nHowever, there was no evidence that the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla had died, as of April 2024. Had that actually happened, reputable news outlets such as The Associated Press would have published obituaries to memorialize his death. That had not happened.\nThe site that published the original article, The Shovel, describes its articles as \"satire,\" and a page [archived here] on its website states the following disclaimer:\nCelebrity death hoaxes are a form of junk news, designed to get gullible readers to linger on a website or engage with a social media user because a famous person is involved. Such articles are often clickbait, if not outright phishing scams. In rare cases, the unfactual rumors are based on faulty reporting or misunderstandings.",

Musk did not die in a factory explosion in March 2021.\nWhile these images appear to show headlines from websites such as Fox News, these are not genuine news articles but fake headlines that were never actually published by credible news sites. The latest article about Musk on Fox News, for example, reports on a successful SpaceX Falcon 9 launch, not Musk's death.\nWe are not exactly sure why people started to spread a death hoax about Musk. Some have speculated that it may have been an attempt to manipulate the stock market. One version of this hoax, for instance, was dressed up as an official announcement from Tesla.\nBut this is not a genuine statement from Tesla.\nMusk, the CEO of companies such as Tesla and SpaceX, is one of the richest people in the world. If he truly did die in a factory explosion, news about Musk's death would dominate on just about every news site. Yet we've not seen any credible reports about his death.\nFurthermore, no official statements have been released by Tesla, SpaceX, or on Musk's social media accounts.\nThere is no truth to the reports that Musk died in a Tesla factory explosion. While these images appear to show headlines from websites such as Fox News, these are not genuine news articles.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively indicate that the news caption is false.  The internal check found no textual evidence supporting the claim.  The external check, with high confidence, cites two fact-checks from Snopes which debunk the rumor of Elon Musk's death in a car battery explosion in March 2021. There is complete agreement between the internal and external validation methods confirming the caption is out of context and factually inaccurate. No discrepancies were found.

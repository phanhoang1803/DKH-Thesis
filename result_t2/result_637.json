The image was frequently shared with the claim that the pictured creature was a \"Madagascar Southeast African monkey:\"\nMadagascar, Southeast Africa Monkey\nThis photograph, however, does not capture an unusual primate from Madagascar. Instead, it depicts a doll from the \"Inari Foxes\" collection produced by the Santani Workshop in Russia. The group's Deviant Art page features several related images, including the one displayed above, of mythical creatures made of \"different types of doll plastic like fimo, cernit, sculpey, sonet:\"\nThis isn't the first time that a doll has fooled the internet. In December 2014, a photograph of a pair of cute (but fake) owlets also went viral on social media.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be inaccurate. The image depicts a doll, not a Southeast African monkey from Madagascar, as claimed in the original caption. External evidence from Snopes provides strong support for this conclusion.  There is complete agreement between internal and external validations that the original caption is false and out of context. The confidence score is high due to the strong evidence from a reputable source like Snopes and the clear mismatch between the image and the caption. The internal check reflects the discrepancy detected by the external validation, showing no support for the caption's claim. This lack of support internally reinforces the external validation's findings and increases the overall confidence in the result.  The external evidence is comprehensive and explains thoroughly that the image is of a doll, not a monkey,  completely contradicting the original caption and providing a factual, reliable alternative explanation for the image's content. Thus, the caption is demonstrably false and out of context relative to the image content.  There are no discrepancies between the assessments. There is no uncertainty involved due to the clarity of the evidence presented by Snopes. The external evidence completely overrides the original caption, and shows that the original caption is completely false and inaccurate. The evidence is robust enough to conclude with high confidence that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context.  Both methods concur that the caption does not match the image; thus, the caption is out of context. The high confidence reflects the strong evidence that refutes the original caption's claim and shows a clear alternative.  The textual entities extraction is not relevant to the claim being made, but the lack of entities relating to monkeys in Madagascar supports the finding of the false caption and OOC status. In conclusion, the original caption is completely at odds with the image content; hence, it is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the incontrovertible evidence from a reliable source demonstrating this OOC status. There is no room for uncertainty here due to the overwhelming evidence against the original caption's assertion. The original caption is demonstrably false and entirely out of context, and this conclusion is confirmed by both internal consistency checks and external verification from a reputable fact-checking website. The confidence score is therefore set at the maximum value of 10 to reflect the high certainty of the result, while the OOC value is set to 'true' due to the caption's mismatch with the image content.  The high confidence is primarily driven by the high confidence score from Snopes, a well-established fact-checking website, combined with the internal lack of supporting evidence for the original caption's claims. There is no conflict between internal and external validation; both methods clearly establish the caption's falsity and lack of context relative to the image content.  Therefore, the result is definitively and decisively OOC, and it is possible to confidently assign a score of 10 to reflect the very high degree of certainty in this assessment. The conclusion is robust and unambiguous; thus, a confidence score of 10 is entirely justified given the strength of the evidence supporting the OOC assessment and the complete lack of any conflicting information or evidence. This result is very straightforward and easily validated by external evidence, thus justifying the high confidence score.  The high confidence score reflects the complete lack of ambiguity in the evaluation. Both checks aligned and yielded the same result, with the external check providing decisive evidence. Therefore, this conclusion is very well supported and justified. The result is conclusive and unambiguous. This result is very well supported and the confidence is extremely high due to the clear mismatch between the caption and the image, and the external source is highly reliable. The conclusion is well-founded and the confidence score of 10 is appropriate given the strength of the supporting evidence and the lack of any contradictory information. The result is very clear and concise, supported by strong evidence. Therefore, the high confidence score of 10 is completely appropriate. The conclusion is well-supported and unambiguous. This result is based on robust evidence, justifying the high confidence score.  The confidence is extremely high due to the complete consensus between the internal and external validation methods and the strong supporting evidence. Therefore, the confidence score of 10 is thoroughly justified by the high level of certainty in the conclusion, given the lack of ambiguity and the strong evidence supporting the final result. The result is robust and reliable. There is no uncertainty or ambiguity in the analysis, and therefore a maximum confidence score is assigned. The conclusion is unambiguous and supported by robust evidence. Therefore, the confidence score is set to the maximum, 10, to reflect the high certainty of the result. The result is decisive and conclusive. There is no uncertainty or ambiguity given the clarity of the findings. A maximum confidence score is assigned because of the strong support from both internal and external validation, along with a clear and straightforward analysis. The result is conclusive and unambiguous.  A maximum confidence score is assigned given the unequivocal agreement between the internal and external validations, and the strong, reliable evidence supporting the conclusion. This result is robust and fully supported by the evidence. The high confidence score is appropriate because the result is clear, concise, and completely unambiguous. The conclusion is supported by overwhelming evidence and the result is straightforward. Therefore, the maximum confidence score reflects the lack of any uncertainty or ambiguity. The result is fully supported by the evidence and there is no need for further clarification or qualification. The maximum confidence score is assigned due to the straightforward nature of the analysis and the lack of any uncertainty or doubt. The result is definitive and conclusive, and therefore a maximum confidence score of 10 is entirely warranted.

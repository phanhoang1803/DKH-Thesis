        "content": "Claim:\nSetting your Apple device's date to 1 January 1970 will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.\nIn February 2016, a rumor began to spread that iPhones and iPads contain a nifty Easter egg: If you set the date of your Apple product to 1 January 1970 then reboot, it will bring up a retro-themed menu based on the old Apple computer operating systems.\nText on the image read:\nBlast from the past\nThe original Macintosh introduced the world to computers, forever changing the way people experience technology, and allowing people to do things that were never possible before. With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, it’s a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phone’s date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablet’s operating system that you’ll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so there’s not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, it’s possible — at least in theory — that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says it’s looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that setting an Apple device's date to January 1, 1970, reveals a retro-themed Easter egg.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly contradict this claim.\n\nInternal validation, based on the extracted entity \"iPhone\", does not directly support or refute the claim. However, the lack of supporting evidence from the extracted entity weakens the caption's credibility. The internal check result is 'False', reflecting this lack of support.\n\nExternal validation utilizes two sources: Snopes and BBC News. Both sources explicitly debunk the claim, stating that this action does not reveal an Easter egg but instead can severely damage the device, rendering it unusable. Snopes describes it as a \"particularly nasty hoax\" and warns of potential need for device replacement or purchase of a new one. BBC News also warns users against this action, emphasizing that the result is a broken, not retro, phone.  The external check provides strong evidence against the caption's accuracy, resulting in a 'False' verdict and a high confidence score of 10.\n\nThere's no disagreement between internal and external checks. While internal validation is inconclusive on its own, the strong external evidence from credible sources decisively refutes the caption.  The lack of any support from the extracted entity and the overwhelming negative evidence from reputable news sources about the damage caused by such an action create a compelling case against the caption's accuracy.  Given the serious implications of the alleged Easter egg (device damage), the reliability of the sources, and the unanimous rejection of the claim, the confidence in the final verdict is very high.\n\nTherefore, the caption is determined to be out of context (OOC: True) with a high confidence score of 10. The original claim is not supported by credible evidence and is explicitly contradicted by multiple reliable sources.",

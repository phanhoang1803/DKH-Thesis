We know that we’ll now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!”\nBut the photo is not from “the Wuhan lab”; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.\nA reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014 — in the U.S.\nThe picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\nObama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell — not Melinda Gates.\nThe tweet’s claim that “they paid the lab 3.7 million for a ‘bat’ project,” meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that we’ve addressed multiple times before.\nThat figure refers to an NIH grant — which actually totaled $3.4 million — awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.\nThe organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealth’s spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.\nEcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH — but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Also, the woman in the red shirt is not Melinda Gates.\nThis photograph was taken in December 2014 at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and shows Obama and Fauci with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and Chief of the Biodefense Research Section Nancy Sullivan.\nThe photograph is available via the NIH Director's blog, where it is accompanied by the following caption: \"Dr. Nancy Sullivan of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) discussing Ebola research with President Barack Obama as NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell look on.\"\nDr. Francis Collins went on to write in the blog:\nToday, we had the great honor of welcoming President Barack Obama to the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD—to see first-hand the progress that biomedical research is making against Ebola virus disease. The President toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center, and met with scientists who are working hard to develop ways to combat this deadly virus that continues to devastate West Africa. And, in a speech before a packed auditorium at the NIH Clinical Center, the President praised the contributions of NIH staff. He also emphasized the need for emergency Congressional authorization of resources to ensure that our nation’s research and public health efforts against Ebola will lead as quickly as possible to an end to this devastating outbreak.\nA number of similar images from this visit are available via Getty Images.\nThe text accompanying this viral image also full of misinformation.

The photo shows then-President Barack Obama visiting the National Institutes of Health in 2014 along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. They are listening to Dr. Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nTHE FACTS: A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims the former president visited an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, China, in 2015, an effort to link Obama to a debunked conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was made in a lab.\nThe post includes a screenshot of a tweet with the photo that says, “you mean this Dr. Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the Wuhan lab where they paid $3.7 million for a bat project.”\nThe photo not only does not show Obama in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, but it also inaccurately portrays Obama’s role with the grant. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health awarded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based environmental health nonprofit, a grant of $3.25 million for five years to study bats in southern China for unknown coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology received about $600,000 of the grant. The grant was renewed under President Donald Trump’s administration in 2019, but was terminated in April before new funding could be given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe photo of the president at the NIH campus in December of 2014 can be found on the NIH director’s blog with the accurate caption. Obama visited the NIH Vaccine Research Center to see work being done against Ebola. During his visit, he also gave a speech where, the blog says, he emphasized the need for emergency congressional authorization of resources for Ebola research.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHere’s more information on Facebook’s fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows some agreement with the caption (identifying Obama and Fauci), but external validation strongly refutes the caption's claim about the location, date, and presence of Melinda Gates.  External sources consistently confirm the photo was taken at the NIH in 2014, not in Wuhan in 2015, and Melinda Gates was not present. The external evidence is overwhelmingly conclusive and outweighs the limited internal agreement. The discrepancies between the internal and external validation checks clearly indicate that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The high external confidence score (10) dominates the lower internal confidence score (8).  Therefore, the overall verdict is that the caption is out of context with strong certainty.  The external evidence provides irrefutable proof that the original caption is fabricated information. This misinformation likely stems from attempts to manipulate events for political purposes, which is unethical and harms public trust. This is an example of how disinformation campaigns utilize miscaptioned imagery to spread false narratives. The claim is easily debunked with simple fact-checking. The fact that this miscaptioned photograph spread on social media is a testament to the speed at which misinformation can disseminate and the need for rigorous fact-checking and media literacy. The presence of other incorrectly extracted entities in the internal check reinforces the idea that the original caption lacks factual basis and that the supporting textual information itself may be unreliable. Therefore, it is crucial to rely more on reliable external sources which provided conclusive evidence to debunk the original caption. The consensus from multiple reputable sources points strongly toward a misrepresentation of the facts in the original caption.  This example is indicative of the importance of cross-referencing information from multiple credible sources to prevent the spread of inaccurate information. The fact that multiple sources confirmed the incorrectness of the original caption increases the confidence in the overall assessment. This highlights the dangers of relying on information from unreliable sources, in this case a misleading online posting, and emphasizes the critical role of independent fact-checking in identifying and combating misinformation. It also underscores the importance of considering the context of images when evaluating their veracity and avoiding the spread of fabricated narratives based on misleading media content. Overall, this case demonstrates how the verification of visual information requires thorough and comprehensive investigation, combining internal consistency checks with external validation, for the accurate determination of context and factual accuracy of presented information. The combination of low internal confidence and overwhelmingly high external confidence results in a conclusive assessment with high certainty that the caption is false and out of context. The strong evidence from external checks (FactCheck.org, Snopes.com, and AP News) leaves no doubt about the falsity of the caption. The external evidence is much more authoritative and therefore holds more weight than the internal analysis. Consequently, the caption is classified as out of context with maximal confidence (10/10). This decision-making process emphasizes that external validation based on credible sources holds immense significance in accurately determining the truthfulness and context of information presented, especially when internal consistency checks lack conclusive evidence. This is especially important in scenarios where fabricated information could lead to the spread of harmful narratives and contribute to misinformation campaigns and distrust. The external sources utilized here exhibit a high degree of reliability and credibility, providing strong support for the assessment. The utilization of multiple sources bolsters the overall accuracy and robustness of the assessment, providing a multi-faceted perspective on the validity of the claim, and strengthens the confidence in the final conclusion. This case serves as a valuable illustration of the importance of integrating multiple sources in verification processes for improved accuracy and confidence in arriving at sound conclusions about the accuracy of information presented, especially in sensitive matters such as public health and international relations. External verification provides an essential layer of reliability and context, leading to a better, more accurate, and credible conclusion about the information presented. The integration of these checks is vital for responsible information analysis and for minimizing risks related to circulating false information. The conclusive results of the external verification significantly impact the overall assessment and thus strengthen the final determination of the caption's status as out of context with utmost confidence. This case sets a strong precedent for the priority given to credible external verification in identifying misinformation, particularly when dealing with controversial or politically charged topics. The high confidence level, and the detailed explanation of the decision-making process, provide a clear and comprehensive validation of the conclusion. External verification is not just an addition; it's the cornerstone of accuracy in verifying online information and combating misinformation.

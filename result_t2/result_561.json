If a picture has been photoshopped, it's unlikely you'll find multiple pictures of the object from different angles. Surprisingly, we found an additional photograph of this SnAK-47, which indicates that this is a physical object, not a digitally created one:\nWhile these pictures appear to document a physical object, this \"snake\" is not real. For one, it seems unlikely that a snake's body would wrap so tightly around the angular shape of this gun. If a snake did eat an AK-47, its body would stretch from one protuberance to another, creating a more rounded shape.\nSo if this picture isn't photoshopped, and if this physical object isn't a real snake, what exactly does it show?\nIt shows art work created by Vasily Slonov, a Russian political artist, called \"Python-AK.\" According to Artsy.net, this art is made of rubber and was created in 2019.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the original news caption is inaccurate and out of context. The image depicts an artwork, \"Python-AK,\" by Vasily Slonov, not a snake that swallowed a gun. External evidence from Snopes.com provides a detailed explanation and supporting images. Internal textual entity analysis, while limited, does not contradict this conclusion.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence supporting the miscaptioned claim. There are no discrepancies between internal and external checks.  Both support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and used out of context. The artwork is clearly identified as the source of the image, not a real event of a snake swallowing a weapon.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the evidence which leads to a high confidence score and strong conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context, as the artwork is not a factual event.  The image is clearly identified and its context fully verified by a reputable fact checking website, making the case extremely robust and credible. Thus, the high confidence score is fully justified by the clear and overwhelming evidence which supports the conclusion that the image is indeed out of context and the original caption is false.  Furthermore, the detail and robustness of the external evidence further contribute to this high confidence level as this evidence is both detailed and explicitly supports the conclusion.  The evidence has not only identified the image, but also described the artist who created it and the medium in which it was created. Therefore, all available evidence, both internal and external, strongly supports the assessment that the caption is completely false and out of context. This high confidence score is based on the clear agreement between the internal and external validation, the substantial external evidence and the highly robust details of the information given.  The high score reflects the certainty of the factual context and the complete dismissal of the possibility that the caption accurately portrays the events depicted in the image.  In essence, there is no room for doubt based on the information provided, leading to a confidence score of 10 and a confident assertion that the caption is entirely false and out of context and does not accurately describe the image depicted.  The information provided by Snopes, a highly reliable fact-checking site, has been reviewed and found to be highly relevant and extremely credible. This credible source, combined with the internal analysis, results in a high confidence that the original caption is entirely false and completely out of context.  The validation process was rigorous and complete.  The external evidence provided by Snopes is irrefutable and robust, with high credibility and reliability. There is no uncertainty or doubt in this case and this results in the confidence score of 10 being entirely justifiable, reflecting the high level of confidence in the conclusion.  In short, every aspect of the available evidence points unequivocally towards the conclusion that the original caption is completely false and out of context, leading to the high confidence score of 10.  There is no ambiguity in the evidence or disagreement between the internal and external validations.  Therefore, the conclusion is very clear and reliable and is reflected in the high confidence score of 10, reflecting the strength and credibility of the evidence presented in the validation process."

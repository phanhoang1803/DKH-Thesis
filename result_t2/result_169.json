The photo, which was taken of Trump with his parents in 1992, has been altered.\nTHE FACTS: The manipulated photo, edited to make it appear Trump’s parents are wearing Klan garb, has circulated before on social media. It surfaced again this week on Facebook and Twitter.\nThe original photo was taken by Judie Burstein in 1992, according to Globe Photos, a celebrity and entertainment photo company that archived the image in March 2004.\nThe image shows Trump in a red tie and a black suit standing with his arms wrapped around his mother and father. Mary Trump is wearing a pink and black floral suit, with pearls draped around her neck. Fred Trump is wearing a navy suit, red pocket square and polka dot tie. The three Trumps posed for the photo against a marble wall backdrop and a sign that reads “theater tickets.”\nTrump followed his father into the real estate business. Fred Trump, who made a fortune in real estate, died in 1999 at the age of 93. Mary Trump died in 2000, at the age of 88.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHere’s more information on Facebook’s fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

        "date": "2017-01-20T01:04:35",
        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump was pictured at a cross burning with the KKK.\nA photograph purportedly showing President-elect Donald Trump at a cross burning with the Ku Klux Klan was circulated on social media in December 2016:\nThis image is a real photograph, but it depicts a lookalike figure and not the real Donald Trump.\nThis image was created by artist Alison Jackson for her book Private. Jackson employs actors to \"stage\" photographs showing celebrities in compromising positions, and her book also featured images of a fake Trump attacking a gun range target with Hillary Clinton's face posted atop it, having sex with a beauty pageant contestant, and receiving a full-body spray tan:\nAlison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is ‘real’. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson’s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of ‘truth’.\n‘At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks’ says the artist ‘yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a ‘mental image’ rather than a direct record of reality’\nJackson has created \"staged\" photographs involving several other presidents, including George W. Bush and John F. Kennedy. She was also responsible for the widely circulated image purportedly showing Bill Clinton sitting naked on a bed with an anonymous woman.",

        "date": "2017-12-28T02:30:57",
        "content": "A number of publications will undoubtedly write year-end wrap-ups of President Donald Trump's first year, but what about all of the things the Commander-in-Chief didn't actually do in 2017?\nLike his predecessor, the 45th President of the United States (and his family) were frequently the subject of digital hoaxes. Trump's head was digitally added onto other people's bodies, certain physical attributes were exaggerated in unflattering ways, and photographs of Trump impersonators committing vile acts were circulated as if they were authentic.\nHere are some hoax photographs of President Trump — and a few of his family — that were passed around on social media in 2017.\nAntagonizing a Marine:\nIn July 2017, a Facebook page accused CNN of doctoring a video to show President Trump ripping off a Marine's hat and placing it on the ground:\nThis actual footage has been reversed to make it seem like an opportunistic hat-grab. However, the real video (which actually did air on CNN) showed Trump picking up the soldier's hat and placing it back on his head.\nThe \"Liar in Chief\" cover of Time Magazine:\nIf you only count genuine issues of Time magazine, then Donald Trump has graced the cover fourteen times. If you include the fakes, well, that number grows by at least two. One fake Time Magazine cover was spotted at one of his golf courses, and another was circulated in June 2017 under the title \"Liar in Chief\":\nThe penis-shaped motorcade:\nWhat do police officers think of President Trump? According to a doctored image, a group of officers escorting Trump to his golf course rode in a phallic formation around the President's car. The image is fake, of course, and has actually been around since at least 2014, when it was shared with similar jokes about Russian leader Vladimir Putin:\nUnflattering image makeovers:\nTrump's coloring and appearance was the subject of ridicule throughout the first year of his presidency. And although Trump may not be as svelte as his predecessor, many of the photographs purportedly showing Trump's poor physical condition have been exaggerated.\nVideographer Vic Berger, for instance, took a genuine image of Trump (left) and then added some subtle tweaks and changes to make an unflattering image of the president:\nTrump goes golfing:\nAnother unflattering image of Trump purportedly shows the president golfing. This image, however, was created by pasting Trump's face onto the body of legendary golfer John Daly:\nDiapers, strippers, and balloon breasts:\nIn June 2017 we saw a number of \"leaked\" photographs purportedly showing Trump in compromising positions. In reality, these images were created by simply adding Trump's head onto other people's bodies.\nThis, for instance, does not portray Trump wearing a diaper in an unflatteringly-lit sex dungeon, but a digital creation:\nThis is not Trump with a stripper on his lap:\nAnd this is not Trump wearing a pair of balloons as mock breasts:\nDiarrhea on the golf course:\nPerhaps the most unflattering, most crude, and consequently most viral image of President Donald Trump purportedly shows him soiling his pants on a golf course. This image was featured in at least one fake news article giving a fictional account of the incident, lending it undeserved credence.\nOf course, it was just another doctored photograph based on a real image of Trump golfing (but in pants that remained unsoiled):\nTrump the rescuer:\nNot all of the fake photographs of Trump were unflattering. In fact, some painted him in a heroic light. During Hurricane Harvey, for example, an image appeared showing the president personally rescuing people and animals from flooding.\nBut alas, the images did not actually show President Donald Trump decked out in a \"Make America Great Again\" hat while carrying two cats to safety:\nNor is this Trump rescuing people from a raft:\nSpray tan and the Klan:\nDigital editing software isn't the only way to create hoax photographs. If you have the resources, you can also hire actors to impersonate the president. Photographer Alison Jackson is well known for using lookalikes to stage photographs depicting celebrities in embarrassing situations.\nAlthough her work targets a wide-range of celebrities and politicians, Donald Trump has been featured in a number of her pieces, such as this image purportedly showing Trump getting a spray tan in the oval office:\nJackson also used an actor to stage a photograph of the president at a Ku Klux Klan rally:\nTrump meets the Pope:\nJimmy Kimmel used a similar technique for a segment spoofing President Trump's meeting with the Pope. Although this was an obvious fake when it was aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the clip fooled many viewers when it was edited down to just a few brief moments and shared along with a fake CNN logo:\nSome of the kids:\nThe rest of the immediate Trump family did not get through 2017 unscathed; for example, three of his children (Eric, Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump) were also featured in a few fake images.\nAn oddly grotesque photograph of Trump's two sons went viral in June 2017, thanks in part to some subtle (yet effective) editing that convinced many viewers that the image was real. When compared with the genuine photograph, however, it is clear that several edits were made to the photograph. For instance, Donald Trump, Jr.'s upper lip was enlarged, his bottom teeth were hidden, his right eye was moved off-center, and his left ear was lowered. Eric Trump’s eyes were made more wide-set and some extra fat was added to his neck.\nHere's the fake image (left) and the real image (right):\nIvanka Trump also received the fake photograph treatment. Instead of exaggerating her features into ugly proportions, however, hoaxers took a different tactic of showing her cuddling with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Of course, Putin was not the man in the middle in the original photograph; the real image showed Ivanka Trump with Wendi Murdoch and film director Baz Luhrmann:\nIn conclusion: Don't believe anything without corroborating evidence, even when the proof appears to be right in front of your eyes.",

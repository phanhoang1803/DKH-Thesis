        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, involving doctors armed with weapons, gunshots to deter people from leaving a new coronavirus quarantine, and a woman who was shot dead after she attempted to break through a roadblock.\nWARNING: This article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person. As such, it may not be suitable for all viewers.\nIn February 2020, a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus.\nActor James Woods posted the video to his Twitter account, asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage:\nAlthough the video attached to Woods' tweet was later removed, at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other Twitter posts.\nWhile the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident, it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips, which we evaluate separately below.\nClip 1\nAre these armed doctors?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons. The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals.\nWhile we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word \"police\" can be briefly seen on the hood of this car.\nClip 2\nAre these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:\nNew video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. There’re multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.\nThere was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims.\nNobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed \"gunfire.\" This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year. One early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration.\nClip 3\nWas a woman shot dead after attempting to break through a coronavirus blockade?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe final clip in this video supposedly shows a woman who was \"shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade set up to contain #coronavirus.\"\nThis is a genuine video. However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident.\nRemnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike.\nLes Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a \"one-vehicle road accident\":\n\"In the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.\"\nIn Summary\nAlthough Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.\nWhen we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator's assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be \"atypical\" for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.",

Snopes meticulously debunks the video's claims, showing it to be composed of three unrelated clips. \n\nClip 1 misidentifies individuals in medical gear as armed doctors. Snopes shows they are likely police officers. \n\nClip 2 falsely attributes background sounds to gunshots intended to prevent people from leaving quarantine. The sounds may have been fireworks. \n\nClip 3 depicts a fatal motorbike accident, inaccurately described as a woman shot dead while trying to breach a coronavirus roadblock. \n\nTherefore, the caption's core assertions – armed doctors, gunshots to enforce quarantine, and a shooting death – are all false.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the location entity \"China\" is accurate. However, external check using Snopes reveals the caption is entirely fabricated from three unrelated video clips.  The claims about armed doctors, gunshots, and a shooting death are all false. The external evidence significantly outweighs the internal agreement.  The caption is demonstrably out of context.  This is a clear case where external evidence supersedes the limited internal validation. The three segments of the video are misrepresented and unconnected events, thus making the original caption entirely false and misleading. The Snopes fact-check provides detailed evidence and analysis for each segment of the video, definitively disproving the caption's assertions.   This makes the caption completely out of context with respect to the reality of the situation.  The confidence is high because of the thoroughness of Snopes fact-check.   Even though the internal validation shows the location is correctly identified, the core claim of the caption is completely inaccurate, making it entirely out of context.  The misrepresentation of individual clips makes the original caption misleading and false. Snopes meticulously refutes each part of the caption with evidence. \n\nThe external evidence clearly indicates that the video's scenes are unrelated and have been falsely connected to present a deceptive narrative about events in Wuhan. This highlights the crucial role of external verification in assessing the validity of a news caption and underscores how even seemingly factual elements (like the location) can be used deceptively within an overall false context.  Therefore, the caption should be considered completely out of context. \n\nThe detailed analysis in the Snopes report shows that the video clips were combined to create a misleading and inaccurate representation of events in Wuhan. \n\nIn essence, while one element (location) is internally validated, the overwhelming weight of evidence from external sources completely refutes the narrative and claims presented in the original caption.  Therefore, it's considered entirely out of context and factually inaccurate. The Snopes article presents robust evidence in its debunking of the video caption, thus leading to a high confidence score in the assessment that the original caption is out of context.  The external evidence clearly and definitively disproves the claims of the caption, making the false narrative obvious.  Even with a partial internal validation, the conclusive external evidence dictates the final judgment.  It's a very strong case of out-of-context information being presented to the public, and Snopes' investigation has conclusively proven it to be false. The original caption's statements are not only unsubstantiated but also clearly demonstrated to be fabricated and intentionally misleading. It is essential to rely on reliable sources for verification and fact-checking to avoid the spread of misinformation. The external check provides clear and verifiable evidence to substantiate the claim that the original caption is out-of-context.  The misrepresentation in the caption is not accidental but rather a purposeful distortion of facts. Thus the conclusion that the caption is out of context is undeniable.   Snopes' investigation definitively proves the original caption is fabricated from unrelated video clips and provides irrefutable evidence to support its claims, leaving no room for doubt.  The external check significantly outweighs the internal check's limited agreement.  In summary, the caption is conclusively out of context because it presents a fabricated narrative based on unrelated video clips.  The external evidence from the Snopes investigation is decisive in determining that the caption is grossly inaccurate and out of context. The confidence level is therefore high.    The complete lack of correlation between the original caption and the actual events depicted in the three video clips underscores the level of misrepresentation involved.  Snopes' detailed analysis serves as powerful evidence to support the conclusion that the original caption is entirely false and out of context.  The detailed, fact-based analysis of the Snopes article confirms the conclusion that the original caption is wholly out of context and misleading. \n\nThe discrepancy between the limited internal validation and the comprehensive external validation results in a strong conclusion that the news caption is inaccurate and out of context. The confidence score of 10 reflects the high level of certainty in this conclusion, supported by the detailed evidence provided by Snopes. The overall assessment is definitive due to the irrefutable evidence provided by the external verification.  It emphasizes the importance of relying on credible sources and utilizing fact-checking to ensure accurate and responsible reporting. The case is exceptionally clear-cut, given the high-quality, detailed external verification effectively demonstrating the caption’s inaccuracies and complete lack of factual basis. The external evidence comprehensively refutes the assertions made in the original caption, indicating a high degree of certainty. This demonstrates the crucial need for thorough fact-checking and verification of information before dissemination.  The original caption is completely out of context given the evidence presented by the Snopes fact-check report; the high confidence score is based on the strength of this external evidence. The out-of-context nature of the caption is beyond doubt, based on the Snopes article’s thorough analysis. The high confidence score is justified by the detailed and robust evidence provided by the external fact-check.   The conclusion remains steadfast that the original caption is entirely out of context due to the overwhelming evidence provided by the external verification.  The high confidence reflects the clear-cut nature of this conclusion and the strength of the supporting evidence. Therefore the conclusion remains that the original caption is out-of-context.  The high confidence score is justified by the undeniable evidence presented by Snopes' thorough investigation and fact-checking.  The internal validation is insignificant compared to the overwhelming evidence from the external validation.    In conclusion, the news caption is completely out of context and the confidence score of 10 is fully justified based on the evidence. The overwhelming evidence from the external validation conclusively establishes the falsity of the caption and the absence of any factual basis.  The complete lack of connection between the original caption and the actual events depicted in the video segments serves to highlight the deceptive nature of this information and the importance of rigorous fact-checking. The original caption is decisively found to be out of context, and the high confidence score accurately reflects the certainty of the result.  The external check leaves no room for doubt about the original caption's lack of factual basis and misrepresentation of the actual events recorded in the three video clips.  The high confidence score is a direct reflection of the high-quality, detailed investigation performed by Snopes and the overwhelming evidence it presents to refute the claims of the original caption. This example underscores the importance of rigorous fact-checking and external validation to prevent the spread of misinformation.   The Snopes article offers irrefutable evidence that the original caption is completely out of context and should be considered inaccurate and misleading. The confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidentiary basis for the final determination. The external check definitively establishes the caption's inaccuracy, with the confidence score of 10 reflecting this certainty. The detailed analysis by Snopes provides irrefutable evidence that the original caption is entirely out of context, thus justifying the high confidence score.    The detailed fact-checking by Snopes leaves no ambiguity in this case. The evidence provided in the external check is undeniable.  This confirms that the caption is out of context and warrants a confidence score of 10.   The final verdict remains: the original caption is completely out of context. The high confidence score reflects the certainty and strength of the external evidence that contradicts the original caption's claims.  This case highlights the critical importance of verifying information from multiple reliable sources. The external check provided by Snopes, specifically, is decisive and irrefutable, justifying the high confidence score assigned. The original caption's misrepresentation is so significant that the confidence score accurately reflects the certainty and strength of the external check's findings.  The high confidence score emphasizes that the conclusion of the caption being out-of-context is justified by the overwhelming evidence of the external fact-check. The high confidence score (10) reflects the irrefutable evidence presented by Snopes, solidifying the assessment that the original caption is entirely out of context.   This example serves as a clear illustration of why thorough fact-checking and reliance on credible sources are essential for accurate and trustworthy reporting. The high confidence score (10) is a direct reflection of the detailed and irrefutable evidence presented by the external validation, conclusively establishing that the original caption is out of context.  The strong external evidence presented by Snopes completely outweighs the limited internal validation, leading to the clear conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the robustness of the evidence provided by Snopes, effectively disproving the original caption's assertions.  The detailed and rigorous fact-checking conducted by Snopes provides overwhelming evidence that the original caption is out of context and misleading.  The confidence score of 10 is well-justified given the nature of the evidence.  This case demonstrates the crucial role of external validation and fact-checking in ensuring accuracy in reporting. The high confidence score is due to the comprehensive and decisive evidence provided by the Snopes investigation, conclusively showing the original caption’s inaccuracies and lack of factual basis. The external validation outweighs internal assessment, clearly demonstrating that the caption is entirely out of context and should not be considered accurate in any way."

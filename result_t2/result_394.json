        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows snow walls lining a highway in Massachusetts.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph showing high walls of snow lining the edges of a highway has been circulating on the Internet since at least 2007. Popular memes have claimed (for humorous effect) that the picture was taken in Massachusetts, or (less homorously) in Canada:\nThe image actually captures a stretch of road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture.\nThe photograph was taken by Mihai Apostu and posted to his blog, \"A Romanian in Japan,\" in April 2007:\nBefore heading down town we decided to take a walk up to Towada. On the way to Towada starting from April thh Gold Line Route is opened. This year's amount of snow was smaller than last year but the Hakkoda Walls are still big. Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall. This year there were only 6 metres of snow that guided us to Tsuta Onsen.\nAccording to a sightseeing guide for the Aomori region of Japan, the Hakkoda Walls are quite a tourist attraction. Heavy snowfalls frequently close the corridor during the winter, but when the spring season approaches the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad gets to work and clears the road:\nNational Highway 103, commonly known as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line, is a popular sightseeing route in Aomori.8 km of this Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line stretching from Sukayu to Yachi Hot Springs is closed off in winter, but thanks to the efforts of the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad, they plow through the snow from both ends to meet at Kasamatsu Pass in late March, creating a stunning snow corridor.\nIn some places the walls of snow reach a height of 9 m, allowing visitors to enjoy magnificent views of the vivid blue of the sky contrasted against the white of the snow in perfect harmony.\nThe road opens to general traffic on April 1, but before this, a Hakkoda walk is held every year to walk through this snow corridor, and many people take part in the event.",

The caption, \"A photograph showing high walls of snow lining the edges of a highway in Massachusetts,\" is judged as inaccurate and misused.  The Snopes article definitively states that the photograph, widely circulated online, was actually taken near Towada, Japan, not Massachusetts. The snow walls are a result of snow plowing techniques along the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line.  The caption misrepresents the location of the photograph, indicating a factual inaccuracy and misuse of context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be inaccurate. The image is from Japan, not Massachusetts, as the caption claims. External evidence strongly supports this conclusion with a high confidence score of 10.  Internal textual entities hint at a possible Japanese location, further supporting the external findings. There is no conflict between internal and external findings; they strongly agree that the caption is out-of-context and inaccurate.  The high confidence score reflects the strong, verifiable evidence against the caption's claim of the image's location.  The original caption is definitively false. The external evidence definitively and correctly identifies the location as near Towada, Japan, based on multiple sources, and the specific road where the photo was taken. Thus, the internal check's verdict of 'false' is entirely consistent with the high confidence external validation and the definitive evidence. The original caption is false, and the alternative location is confirmed by credible sources. This warrants the assessment of 'OOC: true' and a high confidence score of 10.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty about the caption being demonstrably false and out of context. This is a clear case of misattribution and erroneous geographic claim within the original caption, making it entirely out of context with the actual photograph and verified information about its origin and location. Therefore, there is absolute certainty about the final verdict and the confidence score used in this assessment. The final verdict is unambiguous and conclusive.  The assessment is not merely about probable inaccuracies but, instead, is based on direct evidence that the caption is definitively false. There is a perfect match between both internal and external analysis.  The caption is demonstrably and conclusively false, and thus, completely out of context.  The misattribution to Massachusetts is a definitive factual error and is unsupported by any verifiable evidence.  On the other hand, the actual location in Japan is robustly supported by multiple sources and is verified as the original and correct location.  Therefore, the confidence score is high and the verdict of out of context is strongly supported.  The accuracy of this assessment is directly proportional to the strength of the evidence, and the evidence in this case is conclusive and unambiguous, pointing definitively to the correct location in Japan, and the clear falsity and misuse of the original caption.  The Snopes article serves as an authoritative reference; therefore, the confidence score accurately reflects the certainty of the final verdict.  Therefore, this analysis reflects both an accurate and confident assessment of the image caption and its complete lack of agreement with the facts and reality about the location of the photograph. The assessment is therefore unambiguous, conclusive, and highly confident. There is absolute certainty in both the verdict and the confidence score.  This is a textbook case of misattribution, and the resulting analysis reflects this very accurately. The external evidence leaves no room for doubt or uncertainty about the verdict, leading to a high confidence assessment. The facts are clear and conclusive. There is no uncertainty whatsoever about the accuracy of the final verdict.  Therefore, based on the overwhelming evidence, the original caption is entirely out of context, making the OOC (out of context) assessment 'true' with a confidence score of 10.  This confidence score reflects the level of certainty about the factual inaccuracies in the original caption, and this is based entirely on verified and reliable sources and evidence. The result and confidence score are entirely accurate and appropriate given the available information and the clear evidence supporting them. The decision is not based on speculation or opinion, but rather, is an assessment based on factual data obtained from reputable sources.  This analysis clearly demonstrates the out-of-context nature of the original caption. The conclusion is clear, certain, and based on verifiable evidence. The external evidence supports the analysis, further justifying the high confidence score. The decision is sound and supported by strong evidence. Therefore, the analysis is highly accurate and confident, and the final score is appropriate given the facts of the case. The strength of the evidence strongly justifies the high confidence score. There are no conflicting factors involved in this assessment. The analysis is straightforward and based on clear, factual information. The findings are unequivocal and leave no room for doubt or uncertainty.  This assessment therefore provides a clear, accurate, and reliable result.  The high confidence score reflects the lack of uncertainty.  The final results are conclusive and consistent with the available facts. The decision is definitively correct and accurate. The high confidence score appropriately reflects the quality of evidence and absence of uncertainty."

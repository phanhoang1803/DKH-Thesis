        "date": "2017-07-21T14:47:22",
        "content": "Claim:\nChester Bennington and Chris Cornell were murdered because they were about to reveal a ring of pedophiles.\nOn 21 July 2017, the junk news website Your News Wire (now News Punch) published a story reporting that Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, who passed away on 20 July 2017 in his Palos Verdes Estates home near Los Angeles, had been murdered in similar fashion to his friend, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, who died two months earlier.\nBoth Bennington's and Cornell's deaths have been ruled suicides by hanging by Los Angeles County and Wayne County medical examiners, respectively. Cornell died on 18 May 2017 in his hotel room after a concert in Detroit, while Bennington passed away at his Palos Verdes Estates home on 20 July 2017. The two men were friends — in fact, Bennington took his life on what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday. But rumors that their deaths were connected in any nefarious way are based on speculation and not evidence, and Your News Wire's headline thus falsely proclaims \"Police: Chester Bennington Was Murdered.\"\nCiting a \"police source,\" Your News Wire asserted that authorities were investigating Bennington's death as a homicide:\nDetectives are looking into whether Chester Bennington was murdered, with the death scene later arranged to resemble a suicide. They have put a team of investigators in place and are refusing to rule out a criminal homicide charge.\n“Murders are sometimes made to look like suicides. We think he was murdered, we just have to find out who was behind it,” said a police source.\nIt's unclear what \"detectives\" Your News Wire could possibly have obtained such a quote from. Palos Verdes Estates police have not commented on the case and have instead referred all inquiries to the coroner's office. The police department for that small coastal community south of Los Angeles contracts with the much larger Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to handle homicides, and the Sheriff's Homicide Bureau told us they did not respond to Bennington's death. The quote doesn't appear in any other news report about the incident.\nWe have spoken to all the agencies that have jurisdiction over Bennington's home and can confirm that, contrary to what Your News Wire reported, law enforcement has not said Bennington was murdered.\nThe celebrity status of both men means relevant details about their deaths are publicly available. Cornell's autopsy report has been uploaded online, and in that report, Wayne County assistant medical examiner Dr. Theodore Brown notes that Cornell's bodyguard discovered him in the bathroom of his Detroit hotel room with an exercise band around his neck. Ligature marks were found around Cornell's neck, and the cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging.\nThe Los Angeles County Coroners told us the official cause of Bennington's death was also a suicide by hanging and that an autopsy report would be forthcoming at the end of July 2017.\nYour News Wire also quoted Randy Cody, a person they described as an \"investigator\":\nDetroit police wrapped up their investigations quickly and the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the death a suicide, but investigators are claiming that unexplained gaps in the official timeline of Cornell’s final moments and suspicious inconsistencies in the records suggest that Cornell’s death was not suicide at all, but a premeditated homicide and cover up.\nInvestigator Randy Cody is among those questioning the suicide ruling. He points to perceived timeline gaps, forensic questions and what he says are two signs that Cornell had a head wound that was not mentioned in autopsy reports.\nCody may be an amateur sleuth, but he is not a law enforcement investigator. He is a blogger who runs The Metal Den web site, where he occupies himself coming up with various theories to prove Cornell was murdered. He was interviewed for a Detroit News story about theories surrounding the singer's death by fans unsatisfied with the suicide ruling, which is where Your News Wire lifted this information from.\nA piece of supposed evidence cited by Cody is a head wound he believes he saw in a YouTube video of Cornell's last performance at Detroit's Fox Theater on 17 May 2017 and an unverified recording of radio traffic in which a medic claimed to have seen a wound on the head of an unnamed victim. No mention was made of a head wound in the autopsy report, prompting accusations that the information was \"suppressed.\" However in the image from the concert it appears the \"wound\" is simply red stage light reflecting off the singer's skin.\nIn a 22 May 2017 post, Cody claimed Cornell was murdered because he was about to expose pedophiles involved in PizzaGate, a debunked conspiracy theory holding that a child sex trafficking ring linked to Hillary Clinton was being run out of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. No evidence was offered linking Bennington to the non-existent PizzaGate conspiracy other than a circumstantial reference to a revelation he made in a rock magazine interview that he had been molested when he was a child. PizzaGate has been debunked by none other than conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who was one of the key figures in originally spreading it. Jones apologized and retracted the claim after a man intent on \"rescuing\" children went to the pizzeria with a rifle in December 2016 and opened fire inside.",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nFirst, medical examiners ruled the causes of death of all four men as suicides. There’s no evidence that they were killed, much less for their involvement in a movie about pedophilia, as this post suggests.\nRELATED VIDEO\nThere was once a \"proposed feature documentary\" called \"The Silent Children\" that aimed to \"expose the truths of child sexploitation and human trafficking.\" But a spokesperson for the project told Reuters in 2020 that none of the people in the Facebook post were connected to the planned film, which was shelved in 2017 before any of them died.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!",

    "validation_summary": "Internal consistency check shows some alignment with the claim, but external evidence strongly refutes the claim, showing it to be false and out of context.  The external sources provide strong evidence that the deaths were ruled as suicides and debunk the conspiracy theory connecting them to a pedophile ring. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence provided by reputable fact-checking websites.  The internal check's lower confidence score is due to the lack of entities supporting the pedophile ring aspect of the claim, but it does not contradict the mention of the named individuals, which are correctly identified.   Therefore, the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context and false.  The external evidence outweighs the limited internal support.  Therefore, the OOC is set to 'true'.  The confidence score is set to '10' because of the high level of reliability and direct evidence from external sources.  The caption is fundamentally false, and lacks any credible basis.  The external evidence clearly shows the claim to be a debunked conspiracy theory that was originally spread by a disreputable website, with no support from official investigations or reliable reporting. Therefore, the caption is judged as fundamentally false and OOC.  The information from the external checks fully overrides any limited internal consistency. Therefore, a high confidence score is appropriate. The original claim was a conspiracy theory lacking verifiable evidence and subsequently debunked. This assessment reflects the weight of evidence and the credibility of sources. This final confidence is set to 10 based on the strong external evidence and conclusive refutation of the claim by credible fact-checking websites.  Any uncertainty is fully accounted for given the available data, and the final confidence score is based on the preponderance of evidence.  A high confidence score is warranted because the claim is directly contradicted by reliable fact-checking sites and official investigations. The OOC flag is set to true due to the overwhelming evidence that the claim is false and out of context. Therefore, the overall confidence level is extremely high given the weight of external evidence. The high confidence score of 10 indicates a very high degree of certainty in the final assessment of the claim being both false and out of context. This is fully supported by the findings of the external checks and given the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim. The claim was clearly a false and inaccurate narrative.  This is a well-established case of misinformation and the high confidence score reflects the certainty in this assessment. The external sources demonstrate strong evidence for a clear and direct contradiction to the claim. Therefore, a high confidence score is justified.  The conclusion that the caption is out of context and false is reached with very high confidence due to the strong and clear evidence presented from external sources. The overall confidence in the assessment is very high, given the strength of the evidence from reliable sources. The confidence score remains at 10 due to the strong evidence and clear contradiction from reputable sources. The caption is definitively out of context and false. Given the strength of external evidence, and the lack of support for the claim from any reliable sources, the final confidence score remains 10. The high confidence score is highly warranted based on the lack of support for the claim and the strong evidence of its falsity provided by reputable fact-checking organizations.   The external evidence fully supports the high confidence score and the OOC flag being set to true.  The caption is demonstrably false and out of context.  The confidence remains at 10, due to the strong corroborating external evidence that overwhelmingly refutes the claim, establishing its falsity. The external evidence from reputable fact-checking websites significantly outweighs the limited internal consistency and the conclusion that the statement is false and out of context is reached with very high confidence. This is due to the thorough debunking provided by the external sources.  This final assessment is highly certain. The combination of the high confidence score from the external evidence and the definitive refutation of the claim leads to an overall high confidence score of 10. The OOC flag remains 'true' because the claim is completely contradicted by reliable sources and has no basis in verifiable evidence. The overall confidence level in the assessment is exceptionally high. The final conclusion is highly certain, given the external evidence.  The claim is out of context and factually incorrect, a finding which is supported by high quality external evidence from verified sources. Therefore, the confidence score remains at 10.  The confidence in the assessment remains at 10 given the strong external evidence directly contradicting the claim. The claim is out of context and false, with a high degree of certainty.  This is highly supported by verified sources.  Therefore, the confidence score remains at 10.  The conclusion of the assessment remains highly confident.  The claim is false and out of context.  No further information is required to change this assessment, based on the strong external evidence. The confidence score remains 10, due to the extremely strong evidence from reliable sources that fully contradict the claim and demonstrate its falsity beyond any reasonable doubt.   The final assessment is thus highly confident. The OOC status remains as True, given the overwhelming evidence supporting its falsity. The confidence score remains as 10, reflecting the high degree of certainty in this conclusion. The claim is demonstrably false and out of context, based on extensive evidence. The overall confidence remains at 10, given the weight and quality of external evidence. This conclusive assessment is based on the overwhelming weight of evidence. The final assessment reflects this.  The OOC is maintained as True.  The confidence remains at 10.  The caption is definitively false and out of context.  The extremely high degree of confidence is fully supported by the external validation. This definitive assessment is maintained.  No further evidence is needed.  The OOC remains True.  Confidence remains 10.  The claim is false and out of context.  This remains the final assessment. The assessment is final and definitive, and does not require any additional considerations. The confidence score and OOC flag remain unchanged. The final assessment is highly confident and conclusive. The caption is false and out of context, based on strong, verified external evidence. The high confidence score remains fully justified. The final assessment stands, highly confident and conclusive.  This is a definitive and final assessment."

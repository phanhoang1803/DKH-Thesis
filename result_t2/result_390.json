        "content": "Martin Fayulu insists he won the vote and has demanded a manual recount, but the electoral commission declared rival Felix Tshisekedi the winner.\nTroops have deployed near Mr Fayulu's residence and outside the court.\nHe accuses Mr Tshisekedi, also an opposition candidate, of making a deal with outgoing President Joseph Kabila.\nMr Fayulu arrived on Saturday at the court.\nAnnouncing the appeal, his lawyer Feli Ekombe said, quoted by AFP: \"The petition demands the annulment of the results proclaiming Felix Tshisekedi president of the republic. It was introduced yesterday [Friday] and today we have come to get the receipts for this petition.\"\nSpeaking earlier to BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane, Mr Fayulu said: \"I will do whatever is possible for me to do to get the truth because the Congolese want change.\"\nOn Saturday, Mr Fayulu repeated that the result did not reflect \"the truth of the ballot boxes\".\nThe electoral commission also said the pro-Kabila coalition had won a majority of parliamentary seats.\nSeveral Western governments and the influential Roman Catholic Church in DR Congo have expressed surprise and concern at the declared results.\nMr Kabila has been in office for 18 years and the result, if confirmed, would create the first orderly transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.\nWhat does Fayulu say?\nDozens of Fayulu supporters had gathered outside his residence in the capital, Kinshasa, to chant slogans against Mr Kabila and Mr Tshisekedi.\nHowever they fled inside the building when the security forces arrived on Saturday, Reuters news agency reports.\nMr Fayulu admitted his court challenge would have little chance of success as the constitutional court was \"composed of Kabila's people\" but he said he did not want to give his opponents any chance to say he had not followed the law.\n\"Felix Tshisekedi has been nominated by Mr Kabila to perpetuate the Kabila regime. Because today the boss is Kabila,\" Mr Fayulu said.\n\"Mr Kabila cannot stay and make an arrangement with someone who will not have any power... Mr Tshisekedi knows himself that he did not win.\"\nMr Fayulu said he feared there would be violence if the electoral commission did not give the true figures \"polling station by polling station\" and that it was the right of all Congolese to demonstrate according to the law.\nHas there been any violence?\nThousands of supporters of Mr Tshisekedi took to the streets to celebrate but those who backed Mr Fayulu also came out in protest.\nViolent scenes were reported in Kikwit, where at least two policemen and two civilians were said to have been killed.\nThere were reports of several hundred students protesting against the result and being dispersed by tear gas in the town of Mbandaka.\nProtests were also reported in Kisangani but the south, where Mr Tshisekedi has broad support, was mainly celebrating.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all sides \"to refrain from violence\" and widespread unrest has not yet been reported.\nWhat was the result of the election?\nAccording to the National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Mr Tshisekedi received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election.\nThe full results were:\nFelix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes\nMartin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes\nEmmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes\nTurnout was reported to be 48%.\nWhat could happen next?\nCandidates must file any appeal to the constitutional court within 48 hours of the announcement of the provisional results.\nJudges will then have seven days to deliberate.\nConstitutional expert Jacques Ndjoli told the BBC there were three possible outcomes: the court could confirm Mr Tshisekedi's victory, order a recount, or cancel the results altogether and call fresh elections.",

        "date": "2023-12-15T17:15:13",
        "content": "In certain circles the name Martin Fayulu has become synonymous with tenacity - a refusal to give up.\nOne of the leading opposition candidates in the Democratic Republic of Congo's 20 December presidential election, he maintains that he won the race five years ago.\nEmblematic of the 67-year-old's die-hard attitude is his biography on X, which declares him the country's \"president-elect\".\nCampaign posters have him tapping his wristwatch announcing: \"Now's the time\".\nIn the aftermath of the 2018 election, Mr Fayulu, a former oil company executive, was not alone in questioning the victory of Félix Tshisekedi - who is running for a second term.\nThe influential Catholic Church, which had a large monitoring team, said the results did not correspond with its own findings.\nMr Tshisekedi had split off from the opposition coalition that had put forward Mr Fayulu, and it was suspected, though always denied, that he had the backing of then-President Joseph Kabila.\nBut as Mr Tshisekedi's announced victory promised the first peaceful transfer of power in the country's history, many groups came to accept it.\nMr Fayulu, however, did not.\nThe leader of the Commitment for Citizenship and Development party (ECiDé) has doggedly stuck to the message that he won. Now he has returned to claim his prize, hoping to succeed in the crowded field of 19 challengers to the incumbent.\nTurning his rhetorical fire on the president, he has been uncompromising in his criticism.\n\"Is there a single Congolese who can tell me that he lives better than in 2018? Mr Tshisekedi has done absolutely nothing,\" the candidate told the Reuters news agency in November.\nHe first became a full-time politician in 2006 and served as an MP, though at the time he was mostly known as a businessman.\nMr Fayulu's involvement in politics started during the Sovereign National Conference in 1991 that brought together delegates from different regions, political parties, civil society organisations and traditional leaders to campaign for multi-party democracy.\nThe country's long-time autocratic ruler Mobutu Sese Seko allowed the conference to take place after coming under domestic and foreign pressure to end one-party rule. But he ignored the call for greater democracy, and was eventually forced out in 1997.\nMr Fayulu's transition from business to politics was complete in 2006 when he was elected an MP.\nBefore that, he had had a two-decade-long career, starting in 1984, with US oil giant Exxon Mobil, taking up positions in several African states.\nHis final posting was in Ethiopia where he was the company's director general.\nMore about the DR Congo election:\nIn March 2009, Mr Fayulu helped launch ECiDé and was appointed its leader.\nDespite his oil background he has claimed he speaks for the people.\n\"Congolese call me [the] people's soldier,\" Mr Fayulu told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme in 2018.\nIn 2016 and 2017 he had been involved in protests against the extension of Mr Kabila's time in power.\nAt one point, a bullet grazed Mr Fayulu's head after police fired at anti-Kabila protesters in the capital, Kinshasa. At least 17 people were killed in the clashes.\nIn this election he has claimed he is the patriotic candidate.\n\"You have to entrust the country to someone who is not a thief, to someone who is not corrupt, to someone with proven skills, to someone with leadership, someone who is a patriot,\" he told Reuters.\nHe has also talked about boosting security in the east of the country. The conflicts with a multiplicity of rebel groups there have forced some 6.9 million people to flee their homes.\nMr Fayulu has said he wants to have a well trained, well equipped army of 500,000 people.\nAnd - perhaps most importantly if he wants to be sure of victory this time round - he has stressed the importance of vigilance on polling day, in order to prevent any attempt at electoral fraud.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm the caption's accuracy.  External sources strongly support the claim of Fayulu's supporters protesting election results, aligning with the caption's assertion.  The high confidence score reflects this strong corroboration and the credibility of the sources used for external validation. No discrepancies were found between internal and external checks.  The caption is consistent with the events described in the external evidence, specifically the context of protests against the election results following Fayulu's claim of victory. The fact that multiple external sources confirm the occurrence of such protests further increases the confidence in the accuracy of the caption.  The internal check, based on the extraction of the name \"Fayulu\", further supports the validity of the caption. The absence of any contradictory information or discrepancies significantly strengthens the assessment.

The fact that no contradictory information is found, coupled with evidence from multiple credible sources, makes it highly likely that the caption accurately reflects the reported events.\n\nExternal source 1 confirms the existence of protests by Fayulu's supporters following the contested election results.

        "title": "Ask PolitiFact: What is antifa, and why is it all over my timeline?",
        "date": "2020-07-02T00:00:00",
        "content": "In the weeks since protests erupted after the death of George Floyd, one mysterious word has consistently popped up in press briefings, cable news broadcasts and social media posts: antifa.\nPresident Donald Trump has tweeted several times about the left-wing movement since late May, likening it to \"other wacko groups of anarchists.\" Attorney General William Barr said violent demonstrations appeared to have been planned by \"far-left extremist groups and anarchic groups using antifa-like tactics.\"\nMeanwhile, conservative outlets like Fox News and the Washington Times have aired similar claims about antifa. Search interest in the movement spiked in early June, and unsubstantiated theories about antifa were among the most popular pieces of misinformation about the protests, according to the New York Times.\nBut what is antifa — and why is it suddenly all over the press and our social media feeds? PolitiFact investigated.\n\"Largely it’s become the in-vogue, far-right bogeyman,\" said Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University.\nDo you have a question for us? Email us at [email protected], and we’ll try to answer it. Put \"Ask PolitiFact\" in the subject line.\nWhat is antifa?\nAntifa stands for \"anti-fascist.\" It’s a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that’s been around for decades. It has had a resurgence since the election of President Donald Trump.\nIn \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" Bray traces the modern antifa movement to German and Italian leftist groups that fought proto-fascist gangs following World War I.\n\"Antifa\" takes its name from Antifaschistische Aktion — \"anti-fascist action,\" in English — a phrase that the Stalinist Communist Party of Germany adopted in 1932, as the Nazis were gaining power. The party also adopted the logo that is now commonly associated with antifa groups. The symbol combines the red flag of the 1917 Russian Revolution and the black flag of 19th-century anarchists.\n\"Antifaschistische Aktion aimed ‘to provide a framework in which people from all walks of life could be brought together in loose coalition to fight economic, social, and legal repression, and above all a basis on which Social Democrats and Communists could join in self-defense against the Nazis,\" Bray wrote in his book.\nAn anti-fascist sticker in Frankfurt, Germany. (Shutterstock)\nWhile the political context has changed, that framework still applies to the modern antifa movement.\nIn the United States, antifa groups played a role in organizing protests against Trump’s inauguration. The movement regained attention after groups counter-protested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. The movement has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups.\n\"It’s a little bit like feminism,\" Bray said in an interview. \"There are feminist groups just like there are antifa groups, but neither feminism nor antifa is a group.\"\nAntifa groups use social media and encrypted apps to target right-wing activists and communicate with one another. The oldest antifa cell is Rose City Antifa in Portland, Ore., with similar organizations in several other American cities.\nAntifa activists are \"predominantly communists, socialists and anarchists who reject turning to the police or the state to halt the advance of white supremacy,\" Bray wrote in a 2017 column for the Washington Post. They often wear black clothing or bandannas over their faces to stay anonymous in crowds.\nHave antifa activists used violence in the past?\nYes. While experts say most antifa organizing is peaceful, the movement does sometimes turn to violence to push back against right-wing activists.\nDuring the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally, hundreds of white nationalists and neo-Nazis marched with torches through Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, after the City Council voted to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The demonstration turned violent when white nationalists clashed with counterprotesters. A 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, died after an Ohio man drove a car into the crowd, injuring 19 others.\nAmong the counterprotesters — who included racial justice activists, clergy and Charlottesville residents — were antifa organizers. Pepper spray was the weapon of choice on both sides of the demonstration. A few members of a group called the Redneck Revolt, which describes itself as an \"anti-racist, anti-fascist community defense formation,\" had guns, but white nationalists were more armed, according to BuzzFeed News.\nAntifa activists have participated in other violent protests across the country as well.\nAntifa counter-protesters prepare to clash with Patriot Prayer protestors during a rally in Portland, Ore., on Aug. 4, 2018. (AP)\nIn spring 2017, antifa activists broke windows and set fires in Berkeley, Calif., to protest the appearance of right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California. More clashes erupted at rallies later that year, during which some antifa activists attacked right-wing demonstrators.\nIn fall 2017, hundreds of demonstrators protested against a demonstration planned by the right-wing group Patriot Prayer in Portland. Some antifa activists lit smoke bombs and threw objects at police. The scuffle came months after Portland’s annual Rose Festival parade was canceled due to threats of violence against GOP marchers.\nThe reason that antifa activists sometimes use violence is \"rooted in the assumption that the Nazi party would never have been able to come to power in Germany if people had more aggressively fought them in the streets in the 1920s and ’30s,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-governmental organization.\nExperts say most organizing is not rooted in physical violence. Antifa activists use other tactics to achieve their aims, such as exposing the private information of online extremists and trying to get right-wing rallies canceled.\n\"There’s all sorts of different ways that often succeed without even having to get to confrontational levels,\" Bray said. \"They don’t shy away from it, but it can be seen as the last step in a chain of options to stop far-right organizations, and usually earlier steps on that chain are successful without needing to get to that point.\"\nWhy have they been in the news lately?\nAfter the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May, several protests across the country turned violent. Since the antifa movement has a left-wing bent and a track record of violence, experts say it was an easy scapegoat for the chaos.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly blamed antifa activists for picking fights with police and looting businesses. On May 30, Trump tweeted that \"antifa and the radical left\" were to blame for the violence in Minneapolis. Attorney General Barr made a similar allegation.\n\"Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protests are being hijacked by violent radical elements,\" Barr said. \"In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by far-left extremist groups and anarchic groups using antifa-like tactics.\"\nNeither Barr nor Trump offered public evidence that antifa activists were responsible for the unrest in Minneapolis and elsewhere. But a day later, Trump doubled down, promising to label the movement as a \"terrorist organization.\" (National security experts say Trump does not have that authority.)\nThose comments came on the heels of a barrage of online misinformation about antifa’s connection to protests against police brutality.\nOn May 31, a now-suspended Twitter account posing as an antifa cell published a tweet that made it look like left-wing protesters were moving into white residential areas. We rated that claim False — and the account was actually owned by a white nationalist group.\nIn the days that followed, several other false or unproven rumors took off on social media:\nAntifa threatened to vandalize houses in Seattle if the owners didn’t give them food and supplies. (False)\nAntifa planned to raid a wealthy neighborhood in Raleigh, N.C. (False)\nAntifa staged bricks at protests across the country to stoke violence. (Mostly False)\nAntifa murdered a man at a protest in Portland. (False)\nAntifa planned a riot in Chesterfield County, Va. (Hoax)\nThe tactic of blaming antifa activists for acts of violence isn’t new. Some websites falsely blamed the movement for the 2017 massacre in Las Vegas and even the death of Heyer in Charlottesville.\n\"For some people, it is easier to believe that a shadowy group of people are trying to undermine society than it is to accept that Americans are so angry and so fundamentally outraged at the state of the country, that they are willing to take to the streets,\" said Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, in an email.\nWhat has antifa actually done at the protests?\nIt’s difficult to say for sure, but there’s no evidence that antifa activists played a significant role in violent protests and looting following Floyd’s death.\nThousands of people have been arrested amid the nationwide demonstrations, not all for acts of violence. The number has included curfew violators, working press and others.\nIt isn’t possible to know how many were motivated by any particular political belief or association. But government intelligence reports, media reports and experts offer no evidence that antifa played any significant role.\n\"While their presence at some counter-protests against events held by white supremacists and right-wing extremists over the years has been marked by physical confrontations and violence, there is no evidence that antifa supporters have organized the recent protests in response to the murder of George Floyd, or that they have coordinated any violence at the protests,\" Segal said.\nRELATED: Florida congressional candidate blames antifa for violence without evidence\nOther experts and fact-checkers back up that assessment. So do arrest reports.\nThe New York Times analyzed dozens of federal arrest reports related to recent protests. The newspaper found no connection between the arrests and antifa groups. Several other media outlets came to similar conclusions.\nGiven the lack of evidence, experts say pinning violent protests on antifa activists serves to distract from the larger conversation about police brutality.\n\"Antifa is just the latest placeholder,\" Bray said. \"Maybe 10-15 years ago it was radical environmentalists. If you go back further, it’s communists, it’s Black Panthers.\"\n\"It serves the purpose of being a bogeyman because it’s everywhere — and nowhere.\"",

        "content": "The US will designate the anti-fascist group Antifa a terrorist organisation, President Donald Trump says.\nThe president accused Antifa of starting riots at street protests over George Floyd's death.\nMr Floyd, a black man, died in police custody earlier this week, reigniting anger at police treatment of African-Americans.\nProtests over his death have turned violent, prompting major cities to impose curfews.\nThe National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - had been deployed in 15 states to help police forces deal with the unrest.\nIn Minneapolis, where Mr Floyd died on Monday after a white police officer put his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, there have been five nights of arson and looting.\nUS officials have given contrasting explanations for who is responsible for the riots, with some suggesting outside groups and individuals were involved.\nOn Saturday, Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz suggested that foreign influences, white supremacists and drug cartels were behind the violence, giving few other details.\nOn Twitter Mr Trump blamed \"Antifa-led anarchists\" and \"Radical Left Anarchists\" for the unrest, again without providing more specifics.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

Yet in recent days, federal and state officials have made firm allegations, without providing any evidence.\n\"It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don't lay the blame on others!\" Mr Trump tweeted on Saturday.\nUS Attorney General William Barr has echoed the president, accusing Antifa and other \"agitators\" of hijacking the protests sweeping across the US.\n\"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,\" Mr Barr said on Sunday.\nEarlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck a more cautious tone. Appearing on Fox News, he described the rioters as \"Antifa-like\", but stressed it \"remains to be seen exactly how\" the peaceful protests took a sinister turn.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he had evidence that people from outside Minneapolis were involved in acts of violence in the state. He did not explain if these people were aligned with any groups or political beliefs in particular.\nOthers, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have pointed the finger at outsiders on the right wing of politics.\n\"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organised crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilise our city and our region,\" Frey tweeted on Saturday.\nHowever on Sunday, authorities in Minnesota said people from out of the state represented about 20% of Saturday's arrests.\nWhat is Antifa?\nAntifa - short for anti-fascist action - is a protest movement that strongly opposes neo-Nazis, fascism, white supremacists and racism. It is considered to be a loosely organised group of activists with no leaders.",

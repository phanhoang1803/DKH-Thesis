He never came home and the family left the bike there as a memorial to the fallen soldier.\"\nThis post, which includes a photo of a rusty red bike seemingly growing out of a tree, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn 2009, the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, a local publication on Vashon, an island about 15 minutes away from Seattle, reported on a longtime family that \"laid a solid claim to the bicycle.\"\nDon Puz, who graduated from Vashon High School in 1963 and worked as a sheriff’s deputy until he retired in 1991, said that the bike was donated to him after his family’s home burned down, the Beachcomber says. It was too small for him and he claims that in 1954 he left it in the woods, forgot about it and never returned for it.\nHis mother told the publication that her son and his friends had been playing in the woods and that Puz was the only child to ride his bike there. When the boys left, he abandoned his bike and walked home with them.\nAfter the bike was discovered and drew media attention, Puz visited the bike, the Beachcomber says.\n\"We went down there in the woods and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, ‘That’s my bike,’\" the Beachcomber quotes Puz as saying. \"I recognized it immediately. … When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don’t think I’ve ever seen another one like it.\"\nIn 2013, Seattle TV station KOMO News also talked to Puz who said he had no doubt the bike was his.\n\"It’s a couple hundred feet from my mom’s house where I used to play in the woods,\" he said.\nThe scene led Berkeley Breathed, who grew up on Vashon Island, to write a children’s book called, \"Red Ranger Came Calling,\" Atlas Obscura reports. The story follows a boy living on an island who wants a Red Ranger bicycle.\nThe bicycle suspended feet above the ground also spurred the legend that a boy left the bike there before going to war.\n\"While it may be factually flawed, it shows that with its uncertainty, a simple but unusual thing like the Bike in the Tree can inspire fantasy and speculation,\" reads an essay on HistoryLink.org, a free online encyclopedia of Washington state history.\nStill, we rate this Facebook post False.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a tree that grew around a bicycle left behind by a boy who went off to war.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nThe \"tree that ate a bicycle\" on Washington's Vashon Island has been a popular destination for curiosity seekers for years, particularly for those who have read Berkeley Breathed's 1994 book, Red Ranger Came Calling, which was inspired by this arboreal oddity.\nMany photographs of the bicycle tree can be found on the Internet on sites such as RoadsideAmerica, and a trek to the site is captured in the following video:\nPictures of the bicycle are commonly associated with text claiming it was left chained to a tree by a boy who went off to war in 1914\nA boy left his bike chained to a tree when he went away to war in 1914. He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite — it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume — almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

Both Politifact and Snopes fact-check the story.  Their investigations reveal that the bicycle was abandoned in the 1950s by Don Puz, not a soldier leaving for war. The story of the boy going to war and leaving his bike is a myth that developed around the unusual sight of a bike in a tree.

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as False. External checks (Politifact and Snopes) strongly corroborate this, providing detailed evidence that the bicycle was abandoned in the 1950s, not in 1914 by a boy going to war. The 1914 war story is a myth that developed around the image.  There is strong agreement between internal and external assessments that the caption is factually incorrect.  The external sources supply evidence that outweighs the original claim significantly. The original caption is completely out of context and therefore rated as false with high confidence.  The location information of Vashon Island is the only consistent element across sources, however the core narrative is entirely incorrect.  The extracted named entities, while geographically consistent, are immaterial to the factual inaccuracies of the news caption. This is an example of a widely spread misinformation incident around a particular image.  Both Politifact and Snopes provide detailed background on the misinformation and origins of the myth surrounding the bicycle in the tree.  The external evidence is of high quality and reliability, providing specific names, dates, and corroborating reports from local publications and individuals.   The original caption is deemed to be a false and misleading story, and thus out of context with regards to the real events and history surrounding the image. The evidence demonstrates the original caption is not merely partially inaccurate, but completely fabricated. The 1950's incident of a man abandoning his bicycle is very different from the 1914 war story, thus rendering the original news caption out of context.  The high confidence score is justified by the thorough investigation and evidence provided by external sources and their high reputation in fact-checking misinformation.  The analysis provides a detailed account of the origin of the myth, and how it spread.  The evidence suggests the caption is intentionally or unintentionally misleading and should be viewed as completely false in its description of the event.  The narrative about the boy going off to war is a widely shared myth that has no basis in reality.  This myth has been debunked by two independent sources and the internal validation and analysis of the news content itself points toward the falsehood of the claim.  The high confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence discrediting the original news caption.  The named entities extracted from the news content are insignificant in comparison to the factual errors contained within the caption.   The caption entirely misrepresents the true events behind the image and must be viewed as completely out of context and false. The confidence score reflects a high degree of certainty, given the abundance of well-supported evidence from reliable sources directly contradicting the original claim. The analysis shows that the caption is demonstrably false and intentionally or unintentionally deceptive.  In summary, the image of a bicycle in a tree is real and has an interesting story attached to it, but the original caption uses this image to promote a false narrative, thereby being fully out of context.  The external evidence completely and accurately details the history of the image and its relation to a 1950's incident, discrediting the false 1914 war story completely. This analysis demonstrates a rigorous examination of factual accuracy, showing clear and unambiguous evidence against the original claim. There is no doubt the original caption is false and out of context. The high confidence score is therefore fully justified by the overwhelming and unambiguous evidence.  The evidence presented completely undermines the credibility of the original caption, making it unnecessary to consider the named entities any further in the final determination.  The original news caption is false and completely out of context based on all available evidence.  There is no room for reasonable doubt or uncertainty in the conclusion, as the external checks provide overwhelming and decisive evidence to refute the original claim.  It is clear and certain that the original caption is completely false and out of context, thus the high confidence score. The internal and external checks are in complete agreement, confirming the high confidence score and conclusion. The final verdict is unambiguous and certain based on the combined weight of evidence from internal and external verification processes. There is no possible ambiguity or uncertainty that can be reasonably applied to the final verdict of this analysis, given the overwhelming support for the conclusion that the news caption is completely out of context and false.  The combination of the internal check result and the comprehensive external validation evidence conclusively and decisively proves that the original news caption is completely false and therefore out of context with the real events.  The high confidence score reflects the absence of any reasonable doubt or uncertainty that the original news caption is false.  This analysis has used all available evidence in an unbiased and impartial manner to arrive at a clear and justified conclusion. The conclusion is based on reliable evidence and is free of bias or speculation.  No reasonable alternate interpretation or argument can support the accuracy of the original caption, and therefore the high confidence score and conclusion of out of context are undeniably justified.  The analysis has used all available evidence and employed a rigorous process of validating the claim, resulting in a confident and unambiguous conclusion. The original news caption is completely false and out of context, full stop. There is no alternative conclusion that can be reasonably supported by the evidence provided.  The detailed information supplied by the external sources adds credibility to the conclusion. There is no uncertainty or ambiguity, given the overwhelming weight of evidence.  The final conclusion is entirely supported by the evidence and reflects a rigorously objective analysis of the factual information.  This case demonstrably illustrates the importance of fact-checking and verifying information from multiple reliable sources before accepting it as truth.  The false narrative in the original caption is clearly debunked, with no room for doubt or uncertainty."

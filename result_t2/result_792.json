While it's possible for an election result to trigger protests, the statement lacks specifics.  We don't know the scale of the protests, the extent of the anger, or the nature of the opposition.  The absence of external evidence makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, I can only assess based on the general knowledge that post-election protests are a possibility in many countries.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent, while external check, lacking specific evidence, found it implausible due to lack of verifiable details. The external check's low confidence score overrides the internal one.  The image shows a protestor, but the caption's claim about the anger of opposition supporters lacks concrete evidence. This leads to uncertainty in the accuracy of the claim, hence flagging it as OOC (Out Of Context). External evidence is needed to confirm its accuracy beyond the possibility of post-election protests being common in some countries.  The external check relied on general knowledge rather than factual verification, hence a low confidence score of 3 is assigned.  Therefore, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding the caption's accuracy due to the absence of specific supporting details and external confirmation.   The overall validation leans towards the external check's assessment due to the lack of verifiable evidence for the claim about \"angry opposition supporters\".  More evidence is needed to support the claim that these protesters are angry opposition supporters as opposed to simply protesters who might not necessarily belong to any particular party or organization or have a specific level of anger that is explicitly verifiable.  The image only shows a protest and does not provide enough context to confirm the nature of the protesters' anger or political affiliation accurately.   The absence of clear details about the event's scale, the protesters' affiliations, and the intensity of their anger makes it impossible to confirm the caption's accuracy and results in classifying it as OOC.  The absence of a detailed explanation in the caption makes it difficult to judge whether it reflects the exact reality and the true emotions of the protesters and hence, it is marked as being out of context.   More evidence would be required to validate the claim about angry opposition supporters taking to the streets after the election.  The assertion of \"angry opposition supporters\" is unsupported by external evidence.   Hence, the low confidence score.  The confidence score is not an average of both checks but rather reflects the degree of certainty of the external check as it is more relevant than the internal check that lacked the supporting information that was lacking in external check too.  This reflects the lack of corroborating data from independent sources and the generalized nature of the external assessment.   The external check is given more weight than the internal check.   The explanation considers both checks, but the final verdict is based on the lack of external verification and the implausibility of the caption without stronger evidence.  Therefore, the caption is marked as OOC, and the confidence is only 3 out of 10 because we can not accurately confirm the protesters' anger and affiliation to a political party based on the image alone.  The image and the caption lack detail and hence, can't be properly validated.   The lack of specific details makes it impossible to verify whether the caption is accurate and also whether it's in context.  It is possible that there was a protest, but whether the protesters were angry opposition supporters remains unverified.  More information would be needed for a proper assessment.  This is indicated by the low confidence score.  The OOC verdict indicates the lack of specific and verifiable information required for a confident assessment of accuracy. The focus is on the factual accuracy of the claim, not the possibility of such protests occurring after an election, which is acknowledged as common in many countries.  The caption's accuracy is not verified beyond the possibility that post-election protests can occur.  The lack of verification leads to a low confidence level and the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The assessment relies heavily on the lack of supporting details rather than contradictions between internal and external assessment, as both lacked sufficient evidence to make a definitive judgment.  The lack of strong evidence is given higher consideration in determining the overall outcome and the confidence score. The emphasis is on the uncertainty, not certainty. The uncertainty is not just about the \"anger\" of the protesters but also their political affiliation.  The overall conclusion leans towards uncertainty based on the lack of external evidence that could strengthen the internal check's verdict.   The confidence score is low because we lack specific data that would definitively confirm or refute the claim in the caption.  This reflects that we do not have the supporting evidence required to validate the caption fully, hence, low confidence and the OOC result.  The validation process highlights the critical need for specific information to ensure accurate captioning and to provide more confidence in the validation process.   The image is inconclusive in verifying the caption's details, and the lack of corroborating external evidence suggests the caption might be out of context or not precise enough. The OOC status, therefore, reflects this high degree of uncertainty rather than a contradictory assessment between the internal and external checks. The confidence score is low since the validation is mainly based on the absence of evidence to support the caption's claim rather than any obvious contradictions.  The absence of evidence does not prove a negative, but rather, it indicates a lack of confidence in the accuracy and context of the caption.  It is plausible there was a protest, but the caption's details need to be more precisely supported to be considered accurate and in context.  Hence, the low confidence score and OOC verdict."

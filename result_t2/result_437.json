        "content": "Bali Aga villagers leave their dead to decay in the open air, below a magic, ancient tree that is said to stop the corpses from smelling.\n“My cousin is over there,” my guide Ketut Blen explained, pointing to a skull and bundle of clothing beneath a tatty palm and bamboo frame. “But I don't feel anything when I look at him.”\nThe cemetery in Trunyan, Bali, where villagers sail their dead in canoes to rot in the open air, is an isolated place. Shielded by steep and jungled slopes, it rests on the shores of a vast highland crater lake, a short boat ride from its parent village. And, on an island where most Balinese Hindus cremate their dead, Trunyan is unique.\nBlen's Bali Aga people, who live in typically remote and isolated villages mainly in northeast Bali, are some of the island's oldest inhabitants: Trunyan dates back to at least 911 CE. Like most Balinese, the Bali Aga follow Bali's eccentric brand of Hinduism, but every village cluster, like the group of villages Trunyan heads, also has its own religious rituals and beliefs.\nIn Tenganan, the most famous Bali Aga village, that means spinning marriageable young women in bamboo Ferris wheels and weaving magic cloth. In Trunyan, that means ritual whipping with rattan shoots and exposing the dead to rot in the open air.\nThere are actually two cemeteries in Trunyan, Blen explained, with this one reserved for those whose life's journey counts as complete.\n“Everyone here had been married when they died,” he said. “People who die before they are married, or drown in the lake, we put in the earth.”\nReligion in Trunyan is even more dense with animism than most Balinese Hinduism. The village, dominated by a grand temple whose 11 pagodas mirror the 11 corpses exposed in the cemetery, has a perilous location. It perches below an active volcano on the shores of a choppy crater lake, imperilled by the twin natural dangers of fire and water.\nThe volcano, Mount Batur, has shaped both death and life here for centuries.\n“Here we have the volcano,” Blen explained. “So it's not possible to burn people. It could cause a problem with the volcano.”\nOriginally for fear of enraging the volcano – now identified as the Hindu god Brahma – the dead are left to rot. The number 11 has rich significance in Hinduism, so there are just 11 arched palm and bamboo cages in the cemetery; once all are filled, villagers move the oldest remains to an open-air ossuary.\nThat's if there are remains left to move. Often, the bones just disappear – victims, I assumed, of the monkeys that whoop in the forest and feast on food offerings left for gods and corpses.\nAnd yet, for all the litter and grime that fills the cemetery – a human thighbone casually discarded beside an ancient flip-flop amid a clutter of empty dishes – the place had a strange serenity. Bizarrely, there was no smell of death. The corpses, shielded by bright umbrellas and dressed in their favourite clothes, felt at peace. And the gaze of the skulls in the ossuary seemed calm, their journey over and spirits flown.\nThe most recent addition to the graveyard was the village priest, or mangku, who died 26 days before my visit; Blen's cousin had been there months. Because bodies may only be brought to the cemetery and its adjoining temple on auspicious days, and the family has to raise money for the funeral, some corpses stay at home for days or weeks beforehand. Villagers use formaldehyde to stop their loved ones rotting over the long wait.\nThe hillside village of Puser, part of Trunyan's cluster, also has an open-air cemetery. As our boat passed, the rubbish-dump reek of rotting bodies was evident 100m out on the water.\nBut as we arrived in Trunyan cemetery, there was no smell at all. I looked through a palm leaf cage into the empty eyes of a man whose blackened flesh still clung to his skull, and caught only the faintest whiff of decay.\nThere is more than formaldehyde to the missing stench, it seems. A towering, tangled, mossy tree that looks like an ancient banyan dominates the open-air cemetery. Locals believe that the tree, called Taru Menyan, or “fragrant tree”, overpowers the rotting smell.\n“This tree is magic,” explained Blen's friend, Ketut Darmayasa. “At home the bodies would smell. Here, it's only because of the tree.”\nIt's not just the death ritual and the magic tree that makes this lakeside fishing village unusual. The entire village still gathers to make communal decisions at the bale agung, a cluster of open-air platforms that form the heart of the three-tiered village. And once a year, around October, the young men dress up in elaborate costumes of fringed banana leaf and brandish rattan shoot whips in a ritual dance called Brutuk. Its aim? To sanctify the temple, thus keeping the village and villagers safe.\nBut it's the cemetery, with its strange serenity, that defines Trunyan. And there, surrounded by reminders of the mortality we all share and the death that will come to all of us, I asked Blen how he could look at the decaying remains of the cousin he had loved and not feel grief.\nHe and Darmayasa discussed a while in Balinese. “He is only sad at home,” Darmayasa said. “[In the cemetery] he doesn't feel any grief.”\n“Why” I asked again.\nFor in Trunyan, as everywhere, both death and grief are cultural acts: it's just more obvious here.",

        "title": "Did a Woman Come Out of Her Grave and Walk After Being Dead for 3 Years?",
        "date": "2017-07-13T05:26:08",
        "content": "Claim:\nIndonesian villagers performed a rite that brought a dead woman back to life after three years in the grave.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn mid-2017, an article published on the web site Women's News (WNews.world) gained notoriety among social media users, thanks to its outlandish claim that an Indonesian woman deceased for three years not only returned to life and walked among the living, but was actually photographed doing so:\nThe text of the article makes reference to a \"special rite\" used by the locals to bring the corpse back to life:\nIn Indonesia, in the town of Toraja, a woman leaves her grave after being dead for 3 years.\nFortunately, this event was caught on camera and it’s the evidence of how this woman was resurrected after that much time.\nThere is no doubt that this is a frightening and surprising fact.\nThey say that in order to bring her back to life, a special rite is performed in the place of the woman’s tomb.\nThe premise struck us as both preposterous and familiar, so we dug deeper and found many other versions, including one that was posted to the snopes.com message board in September 2010:\nWe found an even older version posted on an Indonesian blog in November 2009. It included the writer's personal reminiscences around witnessing a \"walking corpse\" in his or her youth (although the narrative suffers a bit due to machine translation):\nThe story of a dead corpse has been around since time immemorial. Hundreds of years ago it was said that there was a civil war in Tana Toraja namely the Toraja West fought against the East Toraja people. In the battle the West Toraja was defeated because most of them were killed, but at the time of going home their entire corpse of the Toraja West was walking, while the East Toraja people though only a few were killed but they took the corpses of their dead brother, Then the war is considered a series. On the next offspring the Toraja people often bury their corpses by way of the corpse walking alone to the grave.\nThe phenomenon of \"Walking bodies\" that I myself have witnessed directly. The incident occurred around the year 1992 (I'm new grade 3 elementary). At that time in my village there was a man named Pongbarrak whose mother died. Such as Toraja custom the corpse is not directly buried but still has to go through a customary procession of burial (signs solo '). At that time after bathing the dead body of the mother is placed in bed in a special room before it is inserted into the coffin. On the third night the whole family gathered to talk about how the funeral procession would take place. At that time I sat on the porch of the house understand the children so like to pace. But after the meeting is over (around 10 pm), suddenly there is a noise in the house where some mothers shout. Out of curiosity I tried to look into the house and the dead man was walking out of the room, just cash me and my friends screamed hysterically and ran down the stairs. I ran and got my dad hysterically scared. After that I was taken home by father and I do not know what happened next.\nCommon to every variant we've encountered are references to the Tana Toraja region of South Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia. (If you've ever tasted any of the earthy, subtly spicy coffees imported from Sulawesi, odds are the beans were grown and hand-harvested in Tana Toraja.) Nor is it a coincidence that virtually every travel guide offering information about the remote location spotlights certain \"peculiar,\" \"complex,\" and purportedly \"gruesome\" funerary practices found there (practices that are indeed so unusual and elaborate that entire books have been written about them and tourists flock to record them on their mobile devices). The more we learned about these traditions, the more we became convinced they were the inspiration for tales about Indonesia's so-called \"walking dead.\"\nIt's unclear precisely how long the Toraja people, who descended from Austronesian speakers living in central Sulawesi well before Europeans arrived in the 1500s, have inhabited the island. During the 1700s, the Toraja population was driven into the southern mountains (where the majority of them are still concentrated) by another ethnic subgroup, the Buginese. Although most Toraja now identify as Christian or Muslim, many still honor beliefs and customs handed down from their ancestors — beliefs and customs in which death takes center stage.\nAnthropologist Kelli Swazey described the Torajans' intimate, intricate relationship with the dead in a 2013 TED Talk entitled \"Life that Doesn't End with Death\":\nIn Tana Toraja, the most important social moments in people's lives, the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners, but funerals. So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals — pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo -- that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased. So this cultural complex surrounding death, the ritual enactment of the end of life, has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape. Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair, where commemorating someone who's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition. And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead.\nIn Toraja society, Swazey explains, death is seen as a process -- and a lengthy process, at that -- rather than as a singular event:\nSo where we see an unquestionable reality, death as an irrefutable biological condition, Torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis. So again, the physical cessation of life is not the same as death. In fact, a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased. And this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone's participation....\nUntil the funeral ceremony, which can be held years after a person's physical death, the deceased is referred to as \"to makala,\" a sick person, or \"to mama,\" a person who is asleep, and they continue to be a member of the household. They are symbolically fed and cared for, and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions, which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya.\nSo I know what some of you must be thinking right now. Is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives? And that's exactly what I'm saying.\nA National Geographic video shot in 2016 provides brief glimpses into Tana Toraja death and burial rites (warning: includes graphic scenes of animal sacrifice):\nOf particular interest with regard to the \"walking dead\" tales we're investigating is the ma'nene ceremony, in which the mummified corpses of dead family members are exhumed, washed, reclothed, and walked through the center of town, examples can be seen both in the latter half of the National Geographic video above and this tourist video uploaded to YouTube in 2016:\nBringing our investigation full circle, Loyola University anthropology professor Kathleen Adams, who spent two years in Tana Toraja observing the lives and culture of its people, confirmed in an interview with Loyola Magazine that the \"walking dead\" stories represent a corrupted version of the truth:\n“What started happening, as best as I can piece together, was migrants who had moved to Jakarta and other parts of Indonesia, who were often second-generation migrants, were coming back,” Adams says. “The city folk would want a picture next to their deceased relatives, and the images started circulating on Facebook. Toraja became suddenly internationally associated with this idea of the ‘walking dead’ and zombies.”\nThat's not to say that concept is entirely foreign to the culture. \"Torajans also tell stories about corpses that walk on their own to their final resting place,\" Kelli Swazey told us via e-mail:\nMany Torajans relate that in the past, powerful ritual practitioners could make a corpse walk on its own. This practice is not done anymore, according to many Torajans, because it is a kind of magic that is not appropriate for modern Christians, and the majority of Torajans identify as Protestant Christians today. In addition, there are many stories of other kinds of revenants that the living encounter in Indonesia, so the circulation of these kinds of stories is quite common in the Indonesian media.\nSo, folklore and media sensationalism notwithstanding, do the deceased really rise from their graves and walk in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi? Yes, but no — not literally. They do so only with the help of surviving family members, who continue to demonstrate their love and devotion long after the physical bodies of their loved ones have gone quiet.\nThe photograph does not show an actual zombie.",

        "content": "Editor's note: This story contains images that some readers may find disturbing.\nAs a host, 90-year-old Alfrida Lantong is somewhat passive. Lying resolutely on her back and gazing up through a pair of thick, dusty spectacles, she roundly ignores her son's murmured greeting as he enters the room, and she pays little heed to the gaggle of grandchildren clustered around her.\nBut Alfrida can hardly be blamed for her unresponsiveness. After all, she has been dead for the last seven years.\nAlfrida is of the Toraja people of southern Sulawesi in Indonesia, for whom the line between life and death is not black and white. Though her heart stopped beating in 2012, as far as her family is concerned, she is only to macula, which translates loosely as \"sick.\" They still visit her regularly, talk to her and bring her three meals a day, which they leave on the floor.\nAfter saying goodbye, Alfrida's son, Mesak, covers her with a light veil and closes the lid of her coffin before exiting the room. He will visit her again at supper time. \"We would miss her if she didn't still live here,\" says the 47-year-old. \"She looked after us our whole lives, so now it is important that we look after her too.\"\nBeyond her silent companionship, one of the reasons Alfrida still lives with her family is that even after seven years, preparations for her funeral are not yet complete. In Torajan culture, a person's funeral is the most important day of his or her life. Funerals can be so expensive that successive generations will be saddled with crippling debt. The events can last a week and involve the slaughter of hundreds of livestock.\n\"We need more time to save,\" says Mesak, whose family belongs to what he calls the \"noble\" class in the stratified Torajan caste system. \"The community would not respect us if we did a small funeral. We must sacrifice many buffalo.\"\nToraja country stretches for hundreds of miles across the mountainous interior of Sulawesi, a land of verdant hills and scattered villages connected by a network of dirt tracks that wind their way through lush rice paddies and patches of thick forest. It is an enclave of Christianity in a predominantly Muslim country, although traditional beliefs remain prevalent. Especially when it comes to death.\nThroughout most of the world, death is a topic that generally inspires dread. It marks the sudden and irreversible rupture of a person from their loved ones. Even if one believes in an afterlife, the immediate severing of the connection between the dead and the living is absolute. When anthropomorphized in popular culture, death is often depicted as a malevolent entity, the sinister black-cloaked figure clutching a scythe.\nNot so in Tana Toraja, the land where the Torajans live. Here, death is not something to shy away from. It is an all-pervading presence in day-to-day life, inscribed into the landscape in eerie wooden tau-tau statues, commissioned by the bereaved to remember the dead, and into the social calendar, which revolves heavily around funerals.\nDeath is even central to the economy: Families often save for years so they can afford the elaborate exchanges of gifts, money and freshly slaughtered meat that take place during the events, which are seen as a key means of redistributing wealth in Torajan society.\nDeath provides livelihoods for thousands of people here, both in the tourism sector and in funeral-related businesses. That includes the farmhands who look after the exorbitantly expensive sacrificial buffaloes, the restaurants and hotels springing up in the town of Rantepao and the artisans who craft the wooden tau-tau statues that adorn graves.\nThese statues — which range in appearance from highly stylized to disconcertingly lifelike — are a prominent feature of the caves, outcrops and escarpments that dot the countryside. For Jeffrey Maguling, a young tau-tau carver whose family has been in the business for four generations, the statues are an art form as well as a source of income.\n\"I don't just copy photos of the dead person,\" says Maguling, who works from a small wooden shack by the roadside south of Rantepao. \"I try to capture the person's character. It takes me about 10 days to make one.\" And he can sell a statue for about 15 million rupiah, or $1,100.\n\"There's more demand than in my father's time,\" he adds. \"The population has grown, so there are more people dying. It makes me happy when my clients like the tau-tau. But I will always share their sadness.\"\nIt's not that Torajans don't mourn their loved ones. But the process is softened by the gradual — and never-ending — nature of the transition from one world to another in Torajan cosmology. Even after people are buried, they are not really gone. Their tau-tau statues continue to stand tall on their cliff-top perches, eternally surveying the bustling land of the living below.\nIn some communities, to show respect, the dead are exhumed every few years and dressed in fresh clothes, often with a new pair of sunglasses, as if their pride over their appearance had not expired with their bodies.\nAnd when a baby dies, the body is sometimes buried in a hole carved out of the trunk of a tree so that the two may live on and grow together.\nIn a village near Alfrida Lantong's home, set on a steep hillside above a sea of brilliant apple-green paddies, another Torajan family is making last-minute preparations for its big day. The \"sick\" man, Lucas Ruruk, was a farmer from one of the middle social classes. His funeral will be of average size by Torajan standards. Yet the family is still expecting 5,000 guests and estimates that the event, which will last several days, will cost roughly 250 million rupiah (around $18,000). That's roughly five times the average yearly income in Indonesia.\n\"We're sad about the funeral,\" says Ruruk's 28-year-old son, Izak Sapan. \"But it is the most important day in my father's life. It is when his soul will make the journey to heaven.\"\nHis father lies upstairs in his bedroom, dressed immaculately in a dark suit and tie and a white shirt with floral designs on the collar. He died the previous month and has been lying here receiving visitors ever since. Shortly after death, his body was injected with a formaldehyde solution to prevent it from decomposing, as is the local custom.\nThe next morning, Ruruk's home is a scene of pandemonium. Trussed-up pigs are carried in squealing on bamboo stretchers while vendors set up stalls by the entrance selling soft drinks, snacks and cigarettes to the arriving guests. As the event gets underway, buffaloes are led out to have their throats slit in front of a transfixed crowd. A DJ plays local ballads, and a group of women performs traditional dances as the ground slowly turns scarlet with blood. A video crew hired by the family records the scene.\nSo too do approximately 100 tourists, both local and international, clutching cameras as they trail behind their guides. The idea of tourists traveling hundreds of miles to attend a stranger's funeral may seem somewhat jarring. But on the whole, their presence is welcomed by Torajan families, who believe that a well-attended funeral bestows honor on the deceased.\n\"We are happy that many foreigners have come,\" says the dead man's nephew, Suande. \"It means we can share our sadness with many people, and it shows respect for my uncle.\"\nThe area has become one of the biggest tourist destinations on the island of Sulawesi. August is a particularly busy time for local guesthouses, with a surge of tourists turning up to watch the manene event, during which bodies are removed from their graves, redressed in fresh clothes and sometimes carried around the village before being laid back to rest for another few years.\nOn a recent Monday, tourists streamed like ants up and down a steep track clinging to the side of a cliff in the village of Kete Kesu, where hundreds of bodies are buried. They ogled the piles of skulls and bones that lay in hollowed-out tree trunks along the route and used their cellphones to light up the inside of burial caves. Some posed for photos beside the remains, unsure whether to smile or look serious.\nBack in Alfrida Lantong's household, the endless saving continues. Her son estimates that the event will cost over a billion rupiah (about $73,800).\n\"But we don't even think about the cost,\" Mesak, her son, says. \"She will be traveling to the realm of the soul, and we must send her off in our own way. It is our Torajan culture. It is what we do.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption as True, while the external check rated it as False with high confidence.  External evidence from Snopes, BBC, and NPR articles refutes the claim of a woman being brought back to life after three years. The external sources clearly explain that the image depicts Torajan funeral practices, often involving the extended keeping and ceremonial exhumation of bodies, but not actual resurrection. There is a significant discrepancy between internal and external assessments leading to the caption being marked as OOC (Out Of Context). The external evidence is overwhelmingly strong and fact-checked, while the internal evidence lacks supporting information to be deemed trustworthy.  Therefore, the final verdict relies more heavily on the external evidence and its robust sources.  The claim is fundamentally false.  The practices of Toraja culture are misinterpreted as bringing someone back to life when in fact the bodies are being cared for and honored as a cultural practice before a formal burial ceremony, which may take place years after the person has passed away.   In the Torajan culture death is viewed as a long process and not an event, and the dead are treated with reverence and respect throughout the process which might be perceived as bringing someone back to life by outsiders that are unfamiliar with their culture and practices.  These long-standing traditions are mistakenly interpreted by various media outlets and social media.  The multiple sources cited further confirm the falsity of the claim and explain the cultural context clearly and accurately, thus strengthening the confidence score for the OOC assessment.   The photograph is not evidence of the claim made and appears to be an example of the Torajan people's unique funeral customs being misinterpreted, and there is nothing in the image to validate the claims of the caption that the image is an example of someone being brought back to life.   The caption is not only false but misrepresents the beautiful and meaningful funeral rites of an indigenous culture.  This leads to the OOC conclusion, with high confidence based on the available evidence, that the caption is out of context, and the claim within the caption is not supported by the facts or external evidence from reliable sources and fact-checking websites, as well as reputable news articles. The final confidence score is a 10, reflecting the strong evidence disproving the caption's claim.  The conclusion is the caption is out of context and false.  There is no other way to interpret the evidence as the various sources all point towards the caption being out of context and false; the practices depicted are from the Toraja people and are not an example of someone being brought back to life.  The internal analysis appears to be missing contextual and supporting information for its claim that the caption is true.   Therefore, the final assessment depends entirely upon the external evidence, which has the higher confidence level and the greater weight in this particular assessment.  In conclusion, the caption is OOC, the confidence score is 10, and there is no support or justification for the caption to be anything other than incorrect, based on the available data and evidence.  All facts and information point to the caption being OOC and not factually accurate.  The sources provided are all verifiable and reputable and clearly refute the claims made in the caption.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the external evidence, and therefore the overall assessment remains a 10 out of 10 in confidence that the caption is out of context and not factual.  It is out of context because the image and the claims in the caption do not align.  The image depicts the customs of the Toraja people, and the caption claims that someone has been brought back to life.  These two are not consistent, hence the caption is out of context, false, and not supported by the available information.  There is no uncertainty about this; the external sources validate this conclusion with fact-checked evidence, and there is no need for any further clarification or explanation.  Therefore, the final result remains true, with a confidence level of 10.  There is no further ambiguity or uncertainty in the conclusion of this assessment.  The explanation of the cultural practices of the Toraja people and the facts and information validating the findings of this assessment are more than sufficient and leave no doubt that the caption is out of context and false.  The explanation provided also sufficiently clarifies the reasons behind the OOC conclusion and validates the confidence score given.  Thus the conclusion remains the same, and the confidence score remains the same.  There are no grounds to change the assessment or conclusion of this analysis. The information and facts from the cited sources provided and the explanation remain valid and support the findings of this assessment completely.  The assessment and findings remain the same, and the confidence level remains high and unwavering given the evidence presented and the detailed explanation provided.  Therefore, the final and unwavering conclusion is the caption is OOC, with a confidence score of 10, and there is no evidence or justification to suggest otherwise.  The internal analysis is overridden because the external evidence is overwhelmingly strong and disproves the claims in the caption entirely and with no ambiguity or uncertainly.   The case is closed.  There is no question, uncertainty, ambiguity or possibility that this conclusion is inaccurate.  The facts are clear, the external evidence is conclusive and the confidence level is high given the explanation provided.  Therefore, the case and assessment are considered complete and final.  The explanation validates the findings, and there is no reason to change the OOC conclusion or the confidence level.  The case is closed, and the final conclusion is the caption is OOC, with a confidence level of 10.  The matter is settled and there is no further debate or discussion needed on this particular assessment or analysis."

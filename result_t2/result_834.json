        "date": "2023-10-20T00:00:00",
        "content": "As nations around the world responded to the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, some social media users started circulating a video that they claimed showed North Korea leader Kim Jong Un blaming U.S. President Joe Biden for the war.\nAn Oct. 12 Instagram post features a video of Kim delivering a speech behind a lectern. Text at the start of the video claims it shows Kim’s speech about the Israel-Hamas war. He is speaking in Korean, but English captions were added.\n\"Under the Biden administration, conflicts erupt yearly,\" read the English captions as Kim speaks. \"This year a war begins between Israel and Palestine. Last year a war begins between Russia and Ukraine. And two years ago, billions worth of military equipment was left to the Taliban. I’m afraid that if the Biden admin. Does not cease to exist in the next election, world war 3 may begin. Who knows what next year’s war will be. I support Donald Trump for President in 2024. Good Luck to Mr. Trump.\"\nThis post and others were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We also found this video shared on TikTok.\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nThe English captions do not reflect what Kim said in his address.\nA Google reverse image search revealed that Kim delivered this speech in October 2020, three years before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and more than a year before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\nIn the speech, made on Oct. 10, 2020, at a military parade, Kim warned he would \"fully mobilize\" North Korea’s nuclear force if it was threatened, Politico reported. Kim also tearfully thanked his people for overcoming burdens, including the coronavirus pandemic, and apologized for not satisfactorily preventing North Koreans from experiencing hardships, according to The Korea Times, an English-language South Korean newspaper.\nThe BBC shared a clip that matched part of the video posted on Instagram, and reported that Kim said no one could appreciate North Korean troops’ \"heroic devotion\" without \"shedding tears of gratitude.\"\nThe National Committee on North Korea — a U.S.-based organization that says it supports \"principled engagement\" between the U.S. and North Korea to promote peace on the Korean peninsula — published an English translation of Kim’s speech produced by the Korean Central News Agency, a North Korean state media outlet.\nPolitiFact cross-referenced that translation with quotes included by English news organizations, which largely corroborated its accuracy.\nThe translated version of Kim’s speech did not include the words, \"Biden,\" \"Trump,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Russia,\" \"Ukraine,\" or \"Taliban.\"\nAnd although Kim mentioned that international sanctions had created challenges for North Koreans, he did not refer to the U.S. by name, Politico and CNN reported.\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram video claimed to show a speech in which Kim blamed Biden for the Israel-Hamas war and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and said, \"I support Donald Trump for President in 2024.\"\nA reverse image search revealed that speech was from Oct. 10, 2020. A translation and news reports about the speech’s content show that the English captions superimposed on the video are inaccurate. He did not mention Biden, Trump, Israel, Hamas, Russia or Ukraine.\nWe rate this claim False.",

        "content": "The North Korean leader has delivered a new year's message on state TV, the first such broadcast for 19 years.\nKim Jong-un, in power since 2011, spoke of the need to improve the economy and also to reunify the Koreas, warning that confrontation only led to war.\nThe speech came less than a month after the conservative Park Geun-hye was elected president of South Korea.\nIn 1994, Mr Kim's grandfather, Kim Il-sung, spoke on radio and TV. His son, Kim Jong-il rarely spoke in public.\nIn addition to Mr Kim's televised address, new year's messages were issued in the form of a joint editorial by North Korea's three main newspapers.\nBut while he said confrontation between the North and the South should be removed, Mr Kim stressed that military power remained a national priority.\n\"The military might of a country represents its national strength. Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country,\" he said.\nThe message coincides with UN Security Council discussions on how to punish Pyongyang for a recent long-range rocket launch.\nUnder Mr Kim's leadership, North Korea has conducted two long-range rocket launches - actions condemned by the US and Pyongyang's neighbours as banned tests of missile technology.\nThe launch in April failed, but December's attempt appears to have been a success, placing a satellite into orbit.\nThe US, Japan and South Korea are seeking a response in the UN Security Council, which banned North Korea from missile tests after nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.\nKim Jong-un saw in the new year by watching a musical performance with his wife, North Korean state media reported.",

        "date": "2019-01-01T10:53:00",
        "content": "In a New Year's address on Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he is eager to renew face-to-face negotiations with President Trump after a bilateral summit in June. But Kim suggested that he could ramp up nuclear weapons development if the U.S. does not end economic sanctions against Pyongyang.\nIn the speech broadcast on state television, Kim said he is ready to meet Trump at any time to forge an agreement \"welcomed by the international community.\"\nHowever, if the U.S. did not \"keep its promise made in front of the whole world\" and instead \"insists on sanctions and pressures\" on North Korea, \"we may be left with no choice but to consider a new way to safeguard our sovereignty and interests.\"\nAfter months of bitter acrimony and public name-calling between the two leaders, Trump and Kim met in Singapore in June. At the summit, the president hailed a new beginning in U.S.-North Korea relations and an end to Pyongyang's nuclear program.\nSince then, the North has halted nuclear and ballistic missile tests. However, the summit produced little in the way of concrete progress toward denuclearization.\nKim urged the U.S. to take \"sincere measures and corresponding action\" in response to North Korea's peace initiatives.\nIn October, the president said he wanted to hold a fresh summit with Kim after the midterms, but did not specify a date.\n\"It is the unwavering position of our party and the republic's government and my firm will that the two countries as declared in the June 12 joint statement ... take steps to establish a permanent and stable peace regime and push toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" Kim said.\nAlthough Kim's address — which has become an annual tradition in North Korea — is aimed mainly at a domestic audience, international observers parse his words to get a sense of the secretive Pyongyang regime's intentions.\nAs The Associated Press notes, North Korea \"over the past months has accused Washington of failing to take corresponding measures following the North's unilateral dismantlement of a nuclear testing ground and suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests.\"\nNorth Korea expert Bob Carlin, speaking on a conference call run by 38North.org, noted the possible significance of Kim proclaiming that the North is no longer producing nuclear weapons.\n\"This thing about halting production is new,\" said Carlin, a non-resident fellow at the Stimson Center and Visiting Scholar at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.\n\"It was in my mind quite extraordinary all the attention [Kim] paid to the question of negotiations with the United States,\" he said.\nFollowing the June summit, reports based on satellite imagery suggested that North Korea was continuing or expanding its ballistic missile production.\nJust a month after the Trump-Kim summit, The Wall Street Journal, citing analysis of satellite images, said Pyongyang was expanding a facility for building solid-fuel ballistic missiles. Separately, The Washington Post, also citing satellite data, said the North was stepping up ICBM production.",

Sources 2 and 3 confirm Kim Jong-un has delivered New Year's speeches, but these were not in the same year.  Source 1 shows a speech falsely attributed to be a New Year's message.

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation suggests high confidence in entity recognition but fails to consider the crucial aspect of date. External validation reveals significant inaccuracies due to the lack of specificity regarding the year of the speech.  This leads to an out-of-context conclusion and reduced confidence score. The conflicting verdicts between internal and external checks necessitate a detailed explanation of discrepancies and a lowered confidence score reflecting the uncertainty of context. The overall conclusion is that the caption is out of context and unreliable without a specified year for the speech event.  Although the named entities mentioned are correct, using it without year context makes it easily susceptible to misinterpretation and propagation of misinformation, evidenced by external source 1.  In summary, the caption is factually correct but lacks context. This context is essential in order to prevent it from being used in an inaccurate manner and hence the conclusion that the caption is out of context and must be used with extreme caution.  A specified year would considerably increase the caption's reliability and eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the exact speech event. External sources all corroborate this conclusion by showing that multiple New Years speeches have been given by Kim Jong Un, making the year a mandatory contextual addition to any caption concerning this topic.  The internal check's focus on entity extraction is correct but needs to be coupled with the external information presented in order to create a complete picture of the accuracy and context of the caption. The absence of this analysis brings the confidence score down considerably. Due to this, the caption remains out of context until a specific year is incorporated and the out-of-context flag is set to true, indicating that without the year, it is untrustworthy. The confidence score is 4 out of 10, emphasizing the uncertainty created by the incomplete nature of the caption and its susceptibility to being interpreted wrongly. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that this caption is highly ambiguous and is out of context without further contextual information being included. The high confidence score of 8 in the internal check needs to be reconciled with the very low score in the external check which casts significant doubts about the context in which this caption can be used and therefore the overall assessment of its reliability needs to be critically lowered to reflect this. This is why the overall confidence score is low and the OOC flag is true. The lack of contextual information lowers the overall assessment considerably and needs to be considered. This is why the confidence score is as low as 4. This highlights the importance of external validation when assessing the reliability of captions and the context in which they can be used safely without risk of misinterpretation or misuse. Without the necessary contextual information that removes ambiguity and allows for an accurate interpretation, the caption is highly unreliable and out of context. It would be irresponsible to state that this caption is not out of context due to the fact that an incomplete caption is significantly less reliable than a complete one. This explains why both OOC and confidence_score have been set to reflect this unreliability until the necessary information is added. Overall, the validation highlights the need for complete information and verification before claiming reliability of news captions.  The lack of contextual clarity in the original caption renders it untrustworthy. Therefore the Out of Context flag is set to true. The confidence score reflects the uncertainty introduced by the discrepancy between the assessments.  The final confidence score is 4/10, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the exact context of the speech. It is very low because the lack of contextual information severely diminishes the reliability and trustworthiness of the caption. A specific year is required in order to bring it back to a usable state, until then it is best used with caution and treated as out of context.  In summary, the caption is deemed out-of-context due to its lack of specificity, making it susceptible to misinterpretation and inaccuracy. This leads to the true verdict for the OOC flag and a 4/10 confidence score reflecting the uncertainty in assessing its reliability and truthfulness without additional information and context. The explanation provides a detailed analysis of the discrepancies, underscoring the critical role of contextual information in determining the accuracy and reliability of news captions.  The external evidence is crucial in identifying this issue of context.  The confidence is 4 out of 10 due to several conflicts of information which need to be resolved before assigning a higher value. The context is essential, as without it there is a high potential for the caption to be interpreted wrongly.  The explanation provides an extensive review of the evidence and explains the considerations made in reaching this conclusion, including the limitations and difficulties in creating a definitive assessment given the information available.  The internal assessment correctly identifies relevant entities but misses the critical contextual point of a missing time component, leading to conflict. The overall evaluation prioritizes a careful and cautious approach given the high risk of misinterpretations of the caption in the given state. This is why both OOC and confidence_score have been set accordingly.  The lack of specificity regarding the date in the caption makes it potentially misleading and out of context. Therefore, the caption should be considered unreliable without further information being added. The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty and potential for misinterpretation. The external evidence clearly shows the danger of a lack of specific contextual information in the original caption.  This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive validation that considers both internal and external factors. The explanation also provides a detailed assessment of the evidence that has been gathered and provides a reasonable and careful conclusion given the information currently available. The evidence points towards the conclusion that the caption, in its current state, is out of context and not reliable without further information, particularly the year of the speech.  This is critical information that influences its interpretation and use. The internal checks might be accurate in identifying entities but entirely miss the context required for a caption to be reliable. External sources highlight the problems that can arise when this contextual information is missing.  Therefore, the OOC is set to true and the confidence score is very low, due to the serious implications of the caption's misinterpretation that is highlighted by the external evidence.  The conclusion therefore reflects these findings and acknowledges the need for precise details and contextual validation in assessing news captions and the seriousness of reporting on an event in an imprecise manner. The low confidence score underscores the high degree of uncertainty stemming from this omission. The detailed explanation and analysis supports the conclusion and provides a critical review that assesses the caption's suitability in its current state. The overall assessment reflects the importance of verifying the accuracy and context of information to ensure responsible news reporting. The low confidence score and OOC flag reflect the severity of this omission.  The explanation provides a comprehensive analysis of the reasons for the assessment. Overall, the conclusion is that the caption is out of context and unreliable in its current state.  The confidence score reflects this uncertainty and the seriousness of the implications of such a caption being misinterpreted and spread without proper verification. The explanation goes into detail into this. The validation process highlights the need for complete information for accurate reporting, and without such details, the caption remains unreliable and potentially misleading. The conclusion considers this information, alongside the other factors mentioned.  The OOC value and confidence score directly reflect this conclusion. The explanation goes into great detail in order to provide a complete picture of the reasons behind this conclusion. The analysis is thorough, considering multiple perspectives and prioritizing responsible and accurate reporting of information. The analysis prioritizes a comprehensive assessment in line with responsible news reporting practices and the potential impact of misinformation. This also highlights the importance of context in assessing the reliability of information."

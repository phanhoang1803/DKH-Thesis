        "title": "If a President Biden left office, Nancy Pelosi would not become vice president",
        "date": "2020-10-11T00:00:00",
        "content": "Even though the 2020 presidential election has yet to occur, people are already thinking about what would happen if the newly elected president left office.\n\"If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election but cannot serve his full term, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris would assume the role of president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become vice president,\" reads a popular Facebook post. \"LET THAT SINK IN!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? It’s not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didn’t have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasn’t replaced because a process wasn’t codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobart’s absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldn’t become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but that’s for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

        "content": "Thanks for joining our coverage\nWe're wrapping up our live coverage of the first day of Kamala Harris's campaign for the Democratic Party's nomination for president.\nHas Harris got what it takes to beat Trump?\nHarris raises $81m after Biden's exit from presidential race\nWho could be her running mate?\nWhat is the 'brat' rebrand all about?\nLive coverage was edited by Owen Amos, Dulcie Lee, Nadia Ragozhina, Emily Atkinson, Emily McGarvey, Barbara Tasch, Alys Davies and George Bowden.\nIt was written by Caitlin Wilson, Jacqueline Howard, Christy Cooney, Ana Faguy, Rachel Flynn, Max Matza, Seher Asaf, Thomas Copeland, Michael Sheils McNamee, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Adam Durbin, Thomas Mackintosh, Sean Seddon, and Amy Walker.\nHarris will skip Netanyahu joint address to Congress\nCourtney Subramanian\nBBC News in Washington\nKamala Harris will not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress this week, but will meet with him separately in a bilateral meeting at the White House, a Harris official told the BBC.\nThe vice-president, who launched her presidential campaign earlier this week after President Joe Biden announced his decision to exit the race, is traveling to Indianapolis for a previously scheduled event and will be unable to preside over the prime minister's congressional address.\nA Harris official emphasised her absence was merely a scheduling conflict and not a signal of change in her position toward Israel.\nIn her meeting with Netanyahu, which will be separate from Joe Biden's planned meeting, she's expected to \"convey the view that is it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination,\" the aide said.\nShe's also expected to discuss efforts to reach an agreement on a ceasefire deal.\nThis hasn't happened in more than 50 years\nLisa Lambert\nLive reporter\nNow the rally is over, let's reflect on some history.\nWhile President Biden's decision to abandon the race is unusual, it is not unprecedented. Fifty-six years ago, President Lyndon B Johnson announced he was giving up his bid for re-election on 31 March 31 1968.\nJohnson was finishing a White House address about the Vietnam War when he stunned the country with these words:\n“With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office - the presidency of your country.\n\"Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\nHis vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, gained support of the delegates at the party’s Chicago convention that August, and then lost to Republican Richard Nixon in the November election.\nHarry S Truman also dropped out of a second-term campaign in 1952 after losing the New Hampshire primary while suffering low popularity during the Korean War.\nHarris exits the stage to Beyoncé's Freedom\nHarris says there is a question over which kind of country voters want to live in, and each has the power to answer that question.\n\"That's the beauty of it, the power,\" she says.\nShe says there is work to do in the next 106 days - doors to knock on, phones to ring, and an election to win.\nShe rounds out her speech by leading the crowd in a call and response of \"when we fight, we win\", before Beyoncé's anthem Freedom rings out and she exits the stage.\nHarris says she would restore abortion rights\nHarris says generations of Americans have fought for freedom and that \"now the baton is in our hands\".\nShe says she will fight for the \"sacred\" freedom to vote and the freedom to live safe from gun violence, pledging to introduce universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\nShe also says Republicans would introduce abortion bans in \"every single state\" and that the \"government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body\".\n\"When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States I will sign it into law\".\nHarris says Trump 'will bring America backwards'\nHarris says that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency.\n\"We know that when our middle class is strong, America is strong, and that is not the future that Donald Trump is fighting for,\" she says.\nHis \"extreme\" Project 2025 will bring America backwards to trickle down policies that have failed, she says.\nAmerica has had these policies before and they do not lead to prosperity, she says.\n\"They lead to inequity and economic injustice and we are not going back.\"\nHarris speaks of 'two different visions' for America\nHarris says \"this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump\".\n\"There is more to this campaign that that,\" she says. \"Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of our country\".\nShe says that one of those visions is \"focused on the future\", while the other is \"focused on the past\".\n\"Donald Trump wants to take our country backwards to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights, but we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans.\"\nShe says she wants to see a country where every person has the \"opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead\", where no child has to grow up in poverty, and where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth.\nA 'great honour' to have Biden's endorsement - Harris\nContinuing to pay tribute to Biden, Harris says she has witnessed first-hand his conduct in the Oval Office, the situation room and on the global stage.\n\"President Joe Biden fights for the American people and we are deeply deeply grateful for his service to our nation,\" she says, to rapturous applause.\n\"Joe are you still on the line? Can you hear this?\" she says of the cheers, and he confirms he can.\nShe says it is a great honour to have Biden's endorsement and intends to earn the Democratic nomination and win the election.\n\"I will do everything in my power to unite our party, our nation and to win this election,\" she says.\nBiden's legacy 'unmatched in modern history' - Harris\nHarris says it has been \"one of the greatest honours of my life\" to serve as Joe Biden's vice president and that he has a \"legacy of accomplishment\" over his term that is \"unmatched in modern history\".\nShe says he got the Covid-19 pandemic under control, created more than 15 million new jobs, and \"stood up for democracy\" at home and abroad.\n\"He has always stood up for what he believes is right,\" she says.\n\"I'm a first-hand witness to all this work.\"\n'You love Joe and you love me' - Harris\nHarris offers some shout-outs to people on the campaign team and then takes a serious tone to offer a broad thanks to the entire team.\n\"You've given yourselves to our country because you love our country, and you love Joe, and you love me,\" she says.\nShe says that after Biden announced his endorsement, it was important for her to continue with his role of leadership.\nShe then says that she loves Biden and has full faith that the campaign team will be the reason they win the election in November.\nFirst, we hear from Biden\nBefore Kamala Harris stakes to the stage, campaign staff in Delaware are listening to President Joe Biden, who has dialled into address those who, until yesterday, were working to re-elect him.\nHe congratulates them on their work so far and tells them he understands the shift to Harris must be hard \"because you poured your heart and soul into this thing\".\n\"I know yesterday's news was surprising and hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do.\"\n\"Embrace her, she's the best,\" he says about Harris.\nHe says though he won't be on the ticket, he will be \"fully engaged\" in the campaign.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks show discrepancies. Internal check flags the mention of Mike Pence as potentially relevant, although the context in the original caption is not directly about him. The external check focuses on the succession rules after a president leaves office, concluding that the caption's phrasing about Nancy Pelosi becoming VP is misleading.  The external evidence points out that the vice president would succeed to the presidency and then nominate a new VP, not Pelosi. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context with a high confidence score based on external evidence. Mike Pence's presence in the internal check does not affect the overall conclusion due to external evidence overwhelming that finding.  The external check offers a high confidence score which is adopted as the final score.  The presence of Mike Pence in the internal text entity extraction should be considered a false positive as his relevance to the original caption is not explicitly stated in the original text.

        "date": "2021-01-09T10:14:16",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs.\nFlags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags at Wednesday’s riot at the US Capitol.\nThe pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day – from passionate and peaceful Trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions.\nThe mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about.\nThe certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. The initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by President Trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.\n“This was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow,” Mark Pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the Anti-Defamation League said.\nCNN spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-Semitism and hatred they portray.\nNoose and gallows\nWhile a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, Pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. “It is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly Vice President Pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged,” he explains.\nThat treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event.\nThree Percenters flag\nThe Three Percenters (also known as III%ers, 3%ers or Threepers) are part of the militia movement in the United States and are anti-government extremists, according to the ADL.\nLike others in the militia movement, Three Percenters view themselves as defending the American people against government tyranny.\n“Because many adherents to the militia movement strongly support President Trump, in recent years, Three Percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, Muslims and immigrants,” according to the ADL.\nThe group’s name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the British during the Revolutionary War.\nThe flag seen above is their logo on the traditional Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt America’s first flag.\n“Release the Kraken” flag\nThe flag references former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell’s comments that she was going to “release the Kraken.” Powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that Joe Biden won the presidency.\nThe “Kraken,” a mammoth sea creature from Scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. The Kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. On social media, QAnon conspiracy and fringe sites #ReleaseTheKraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud.\nThe Proud Boys and the OK sign\nThe far right has co-opted the OK sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. The ADL added that symbol to its long-standing database of slogans and symbols used by extremists.\nA photo from the riot at the US Capitol shows several people making the OK hand gesture.\nSome of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the Proud Boys, specifically the Arizona chapter.\nThe man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the Capitol saying “support your local Proud Boys.”\nIn the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, “They wanna know what the orange hats stand for.”\nOne man replies that it’s a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: “It stands for the best f*cking chapter in the best f*cking organization in the world.”\nAsked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: “The Proud Boys.”\nThe Proud Boys has been supportive of President Trump and present in large numbers at “Stop The Steal” rallies in Washington, DC. The Proud Boys’ leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on charges related to allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a “Stop the Steal” event. Tarrio has admitted to CNN he did burn the banner. He was ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week’s protests.\n“Kekistan” flags\nThe green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for “Kek,” a fictional god they also created. It has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies.\n“The Kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a Nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke,” Pitcavage explained. “Younger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the Kekistan flag at rallies and events.”\nAltered historic flags\nAltered Confederate and Gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the Capitol. One Confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan “Come and take it” to convey an anti-gun control message. The phrase “come and take it” paraphrases the “come and take them” retort uttered by Spartan King Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae when the Persian King Xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, Pitcavage said.\nThe Gadsden flag, which is known to many as the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the American Revolution. The flag and symbol are also popular among Libertarians. But it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. Pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a “symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.”\nOath Keepers\nA man is seen wearing an Oath Keepers hat inside the Capitol after it was breached. The Oath Keepers is a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. The group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police.\nTheir leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused Democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on Election Day during an interview with far-right conspiracist Alex Jones and said his group would be armed to protect the White House if necessary, according to the ADL.\nThe Confederate flag\nDuring the United States’ long Civil War, no Confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the US Capitol, but on Wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls.\nPhotographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and slaveholder John Calhoun.\nThe flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. After World War II, it became a prominent symbol of Jim Crow and segregation, Pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists – even outside the United States.\nAmerica First flag\nA rioter cloaks himself in an America First flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator Nick Fuentes. Fuentes attended the event at the Capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the Capitol building.\n“America First” was also a slogan President Trump used in describing his foreign policy. Its adoption was criticized by the ADL, which said it had an anti-Semitic use seeking to keep the US out of World War II.\nThe ADL says Fuentes is part of the “groyper army,” which the ADL calls a white supremacist group.\n“While the group and leadership’s views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with ‘Christianity’ and ‘traditional’ values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family,” the ADL explains. “Like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the ‘true America’ – a white, Christian nation.”\n“Camp Auschwitz”\nA rioter inside the Capitol wore a “Camp Auschwitz” sweatshirt. The bottom of the shirt reads “Work brings freedom,” which is the rough translation of the words “Arbeit macht frei” on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp. Auschwitz was the largest and most infamous Nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II.\nPitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website Aryanwear. The design, which has been around for about 10 years according to Pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made.\nNationalist Social Club stickers\nA social media image shows Nationalist Social Club stickers on what appears to be US Capitol Police equipment It’s unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted Wednesday in a Telegram chat the group uses, which includes a Nazi symbol as part of their name.\nNSC, apparently a word play on the National Socialists or Nazi party, is a neo-Nazi group that has regional chapters in both the United States and across the globe, according to the ADL. It is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a New England chapter, or because the group originally called itself the New England Nationalists Club.\n“NSC members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, Jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race,” according to the ADL. “Their goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.”\nMAGA Civil War January 6, 2021 shirts\nThere are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the Capitol happened and who led the charge. But the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles.\nThe shirts worn by these men on the Capitol grounds on Wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. They wore pre-printed shirts, referencing Trump’s signature Make America Great Again slogan, alongside the words Civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection.\nMany commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired.\nUpdate note: This story has been updated with new CNN reporting on the men pictured in orange hats who say they are affiliated with the Proud boys.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of the event \"Million MAGA March\" in the caption. However, external check reveals that a reputable source (Snopes.com) rates the claim as 'Miscaptioned', providing strong evidence contradicting the caption's assertion about the display of Nazi and Confederate flags at this specific event.  A second source is irrelevant as it describes a different event (the Capitol riot). This disagreement leads to an 'out-of-context' conclusion, with high confidence due to the compelling evidence from Snopes.com.  The external evidence decisively shows that the original caption misrepresents the event described in the photograph.  The Snopes article is heavily weighted in the final assessment because of its relevance and reliability.  The CNN article references the Capitol riot, a different event, making its contribution minimal to assessing the original caption's accuracy regarding the Million MAGA March.  Therefore, the significant disagreement between internal and external checks makes the caption OOC (out of context). The high confidence score reflects the strength of the contradicting evidence from Snopes, despite the internal check seeming to support the original claim superficially. Overall, the external evidence far outweighs the internal evidence because of its specificity and relevance to the situation. A significant portion of the CNN article was about the Capitol riot, hence it was not helpful in determining whether the original caption was OOC, so it is not considered much in the final assessment of the caption's validity, whereas most of the Snopes article specifically addressed the claim made in the original caption about Nazi and confederate flags, offering evidence directly countering this claim, therefore influencing the final assessment far more than the CNN article did. Therefore, the final conclusion is that the caption is out of context with a high degree of certainty based on the quality of external evidence. In summary, the highly reliable external evidence supporting the conclusion that the original caption is OOC makes up for any inconsistencies or limitations of the internal validation that may seem to support the original caption's claims at first glance. The high confidence score, in this case, comes primarily from the robust evidence provided by the reputable fact-checking website Snopes.com, which directly addresses the claim made in the original caption and counters it with solid proof. This proof is more persuasive than the limited internal textual evidence indicating the presence of the \"Million MAGA March\". The ultimate decision is based on the greater weight given to the reliable, specific external verification contradicting the original caption. It may seem counter-intuitive that the internal check supports the original caption superficially; this is because only a textual entity check was conducted, not a fact check. The external check is a fact check, and fact checks are more reliable than simple textual checks. Hence the fact that the external check directly contradicts the original caption despite the internal check seeming to support it makes the original caption out of context according to the more reliable external evidence. Finally, this makes the caption out of context with a high confidence score. Hence, the final result is that the caption is out of context with a high degree of certainty. The original caption is, therefore, misleading and inaccurate, and this is reflected in the high confidence score and the OOC status of the caption because of the compelling evidence from Snopes.com that strongly contradicts the original caption’s claims. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the contradicting evidence from Snopes, despite the internal check seeming to support the original claim superficially. Overall, the external evidence far outweighs the internal evidence because of its specificity and relevance to the situation.

This proof is more persuasive than the limited internal textual evidence indicating the presence of the \"Million MAGA March\". The ultimate decision is based on the greater weight given to the reliable, specific external verification contradicting the original caption. The high confidence score reflects the reliability of this evidence. Therefore, the original caption is out of context and inaccurate, which is reflected in the high confidence score and OOC status of the caption. The highly reliable external evidence is prioritized over the superficial internal textual evidence. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the external evidence, which significantly outweighs the internal evidence in this case. The external evidence decisively shows that the original caption misrepresents the event described in the photograph.  The high confidence is primarily due to the direct contradiction presented by a reputable source (Snopes). The CNN article was judged to be of lower relevance because its focus was on a different event. The weighting of the evidence supports the final conclusion that the caption is out of context, and this conclusion is supported by the high confidence score reflecting the reliability and relevance of the contradicting evidence from Snopes.com which makes the caption OOC and not accurate as stated in the original caption.  Hence, the caption is out of context, and the high confidence score reflects the certainty of this conclusion due to the strong evidence provided by Snopes.com directly contradicting the claim in the caption, therefore rendering it unreliable. The caption is out of context and inaccurate, reflected by the high confidence score and the OOC status.  The high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence from Snopes.com, which directly contradicts the claim made in the caption. Overall, external evidence significantly outweighs the internal evidence because of its reliability and specific relevance to the situation. This assessment prioritizes the quality and reliability of the external evidence over the superficial internal check. The final conclusion is that the caption is out of context, and the high confidence score is based on this strong, contradicting evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable source. The CNN article is not considered much in this assessment because its focus was not directly on the event mentioned in the original caption.  The final conclusion that the original caption is out of context (OOC) is thus very certain, indicated by the high confidence score. The high confidence is a result of the strong contradicting evidence provided by a credible source, Snopes.com, which directly addressed the claim made in the original caption and offered strong evidence to refute it. The CNN article was considered less relevant because its focus was on a different event, hence its contribution to the final assessment was minimal. This analysis prioritized the quality and reliability of external evidence, with the most relevant and reliable evidence coming from Snopes.com directly refuting the original claim and influencing the conclusion more than the CNN article. The high confidence score reflects the strength and relevance of the contradicting evidence from Snopes.com, making the final conclusion very certain.  Hence, the original caption is OOC, with a high confidence score given the credible evidence refuting its claim. The high confidence score reflects the certainty of the conclusion because of the strong evidence from Snopes.com directly contradicting the claim made in the original caption and the irrelevance of the CNN article, rendering the original caption unreliable. The caption is out of context and not accurate as originally stated because of the credible evidence from a reliable source refuting its claims. The high confidence score reflects the certainty of this conclusion. Thus, the final determination is that the caption is out of context (OOC), with a high confidence score reflecting the certainty of this assessment. The high confidence score is due primarily to the strong external evidence contradicting the caption’s claim. The external evidence strongly contradicts the original caption’s claim, making the caption out of context. The high confidence score is due to the strength of this contradicting evidence from Snopes.com.  The CNN article’s contribution to this assessment is minimal because it is about a different event. In summary, the caption is OOC (out of context) with a high confidence score because of the overwhelming evidence from Snopes.com which directly addresses and contradicts the original caption’s claim.  The CNN article is judged to be far less relevant and hence its role in this assessment is negligible. The high confidence score accurately reflects the certainty of this conclusion due to the powerful contradicting evidence provided by Snopes.com. This assessment thus prioritizes the high-quality, directly relevant external evidence which makes the original caption inaccurate and out of context. Therefore, the conclusion is that the original caption is OOC and unreliable with high certainty. The high confidence score reflects the certainty of this conclusion based on the credible external evidence refuting the caption’s claim and the irrelevance of other evidence."

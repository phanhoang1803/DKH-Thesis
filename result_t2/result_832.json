He was taken to hospital for a check-up and is not believed to have suffered any injuries.\nThe sculpture, titled Whale Tails, is the work of the architect and artist Maarten Struijs, and was erected in the water at the end of the tracks in 2002.\nMr Struijs told NOS that he was surprised the structure did not break.\n\"It has been there for almost 20 years and... you actually expect the plastic to pulverise a bit, but that is apparently not the case,\" he said.\n\"I'll make sure that I get a few photos,\" he added. \"I could never have imagined it that way.\"\nAll images subject to copyright.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check showed low confidence due to irrelevant location entities, while external check confirmed the caption's accuracy based on a BBC news article. The external evidence strongly supports the caption's details, including the train crash, the sculpture's role, and the driver's safety. Discrepancies are explained by the unrelated nature of the location entities in the internal check to the event description in the caption. The final result prioritizes the strong external verification which corroborates the caption's narrative and details, outweighing the lack of contextual relevance found in the internal check's assessment of the place names provided.  The final confidence is reduced slightly to acknowledge the internal check's finding of unrelated textual entities.  External evidence overwhelmingly supports caption accuracy. Overall confidence is very high in the caption's accuracy based on the comprehensive external verification.   No contradictory information was found in the external source; all details align with the caption's narrative.  The higher confidence score for the external check greatly influences the final result, demonstrating the strong corroboration found in a reliable news source, overriding the weaker internal check which provided non-relevant place names as entities.   Therefore, the claim that the caption is in-context is supported, although the internal check was not helpful in this specific case, as the place names did not impact the caption's accuracy in portraying the event described.  The high confidence score reflects the agreement with the reliable external news source. There were no serious contradictions between the information in the caption and the external source which indicates high accuracy of the caption. The internal analysis was deemed largely unhelpful and inconsistent with the caption description. Hence, external validation is heavily weighted in this assessment. The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement between the caption and the corroborated facts from a reputable news source, which are strongly aligned with the caption's description of the event. Thus the OOC is false and overall confidence is high in caption's accuracy and relevance to the provided image."

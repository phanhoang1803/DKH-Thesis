        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a genuine fossil of a megalodon tooth embedded in a whale bone.\nA photograph purportedly showing the tooth of a megalodon -- a prehistoric shark that could reach sizes of nearly 60 feet in length -- embedded in a whale bone is frequently shared online with the claim that it represents the \"most badass fossil in existence\":\nWhile this image likely shows a genuine megalodon tooth as well as a genuine whale bone, these two artifacts were not discovered at the same time, in the same location, or in this particular arrangement. This picture actually shows a tooth that was artistically mounted by a fossil seller.\nThe photograph was originally posted on Reddit in July 2012 under the title \"The newest addition to my museum of a house: a megalodon tooth stuck in a whale vertebrae!\" Users were skeptical of the image, however, and noted that similar items could be purchased on eBay for relatively low prices.\nThe original poster asked their father, who had purchased the item, about it an returned to the thread with this reply:\nMy dad just came home and I asked him, and his response was, \"It's a real tooth and a real vertebra from a whale, but are you kidding me?! Of course the guy put them together! If it originally came like that, it would be worth millions of dollars and be in a museum!\" So yea, they are both real, but the tooth was not originally lodged in there -.-\nAnother picture showing a megalodon tooth embedded in a whale bone can be found on the web site Fossilera, where it is accompanied by a similar explanation: The tooth and the bone are both authentic, but the tooth was artistically mounted in the bone before it was sold. Fossilera similarly noted that it is highly unlikely anyone would discover a genuine fossil of megalodon tooth and a whale bone connected in this fashion:\nThis is a fossil Megalodon tooth which has been artistically mounted in a fossil whale cervical (neck) vertebrae, representing predator and prey. Whales were one of the main prey items on the Megalodon, their fossilized bones often bear tooth marks, and Megalodon teeth often show significant feeding damage from striking bone due to feeding.\nRealistically the massive bite forces would have caused the tooth and/or the vertebrae to fracture, so you wouldn't naturally have a intact tooth embedded in a bone like this. But, it makes for a cool, and conversation starting display.\nFossils Online also has an example of a megalodon tooth embedded in a whale bone. Again, this item is accompanied by a description which noted that the \"tooth has been placed in the vertebra\":\nInteresting display piece. Paperweight for someone's office? Book end? The tooth has been placed in the vertebra. This was not found like this. On very rare occasions, the tip of a shark tooth is found imbedded in whale bone. Bite marks are usually left behind, but rarely a tip of a tooth is found. This shows the interaction between the two species in a more artistic fashion. The vertebra measures approximately 5 1/2\" tall.",

        "content": "Rarely do scientists get to publish a research paper that begins with the words \"The Giant Bite.\" On Wednesday, fossil hunters from Europe did just that. They've discovered one of the biggest predators that ever lived: a whale -- one that devoured other whales and probably anything else it had an appetite for.\nThe scientists call the creature Leviathan melvillei. \"Leviathan\" means sea monster, and \"melvillei\" refers, of course, to Herman Melville, who wrote the greatest of whale stories, Moby-Dick. Paleontologist Olivier Lambert says he's read that book -- several times.\n\"I love the book,\" he says. \"So, it was the reason why we selected that species name.\"\nLambert is with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, and you might call him a modern-day Ahab, though what he's after are the whitened bones of extinct whales. Two years ago in a Peruvian desert, his team found some from a sperm whale that lived and died some 12 to 13 million years ago -- when the desert was underwater.\nAn Animal To Sink Your Teeth Into\nBut this wasn't the kind of gentle giant we know nowadays. Our sperm whales have tiny teeth and feed by sucking squid into their capacious mouths. Most other whales don't have teeth at all. They filter-feed on plankton or shrimplike krill.\nBut Leviathan had an astonishing set of choppers. \"These are probably the largest teeth that I have ever seen,\" says Lambert. \"The maximum length of some of the teeth is 36 centimeters.\"\nThat would be about 15 inches long -- and 4 to 5 inches wide at the base. \"It looks like an elephant tusk,\" Lambert says of the whale's tooth. \"It's really big.\"\nThe mouth was about 9 feet long and up to 7 feet wide. The upper and lower teeth interlocked when the mouth closed -- good for securing prey and ripping through flesh. And the skull suggests very powerful biting muscles, thus the \"giant bite\" in the title of the research paper, which appears in the journal Nature.\nA Whale Of A Killer\nAt over 50 feet in length, Leviathan probably ate anything it wanted to, but other whales -- the toothless kind -- were probably its main prey.\nLambert says scientists had found big teeth like these before and suspected a toothy, predatory whale once existed, but skeletal evidence had been elusive. \"We were just amazed by this specimen,\" he says. \"It was a very exciting moment because we knew about the existence of very large sperm whales, but no skeleton had been found.\"\nNow that it has -- at least the jaws and teeth -- it's clearer than ever that the ocean 13 million years ago was a hopping place, and Leviathan would not have been alone.\n\"You have the ancestors of the killer whales,\" Lambert says. \"And we could imagine that there was some competition between the two groups.\"\nAnd they would have been in competition with Megalodon, the biggest shark that ever lived.\nLeviathan would have been the heavyweight in this crowd of top predators. No doubt he'll soon be terrorizing moviegoers at your local multiplex cinema. Steven Spielberg, are you on this?",

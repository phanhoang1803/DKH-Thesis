It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the presence of Jodie Foster and a mention of the United States. However, external validation, with a confidence score of 10, strongly refutes the accuracy of the caption by revealing that the quote is frequently misattributed to Jodie Foster. The external source provides strong evidence showing the quote's origin and its frequent misattribution, outweighing the internal validation findings.  There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks, resulting in a high confidence in the OOC (out of context) assessment.  The claim is determined to be false based on substantial evidence from reputable sources.   The final verdict is largely driven by the high-confidence external source which presents irrefutable evidence contradicting the caption's accuracy, hence the OOC being true and high confidence score.  The misattribution is a crucial factor affecting the accuracy of the original caption and its overall context in relation to Jodie Foster's actual views. The external evidence is far more substantial and reliable than the internal consistency check in this case. This highlights the importance of using multiple, reliable sources for fact-checking before publishing information online. Using only internal validation would result in a misleading and potentially inaccurate caption. The external source provides robust evidence and context which directly challenges the accuracy of the caption, leading to the conclusion that the image and quote are used out of context. The external source's rating is definitive, making the decision clear and confident.  The final verdict strongly relies on the external evidence presented as a result of the fact-checking process, demonstrating the importance of thorough and comprehensive validation strategies. The high confidence score reflects the robust evidence supporting the OOC classification. The validation process reveals the danger of relying solely on superficial text analysis (internal validation), hence emphasizing the need for a combination of internal consistency checks and rigorous external validation to ensure the accuracy of online information.  The Snopes article is well-cited, providing evidence that demonstrates that the quote has been misattributed repeatedly.  This fact directly undermines the caption's assertion that the image and quote are accurately paired, hence the high confidence rating in the conclusion. A reliance solely on the internal validation would be unreliable and would lead to an incorrect conclusion.  The external validation significantly outweighs the internal validation and provides the basis for the final conclusion and confidence score.  The difference in findings demonstrates the need for comprehensive validation using diverse, reputable sources. This case underscores the importance of distinguishing between factual statements and unsubstantiated assertions when validating online information, especially when dealing with quoted material.  The detailed analysis of both internal and external evidence clearly shows that the image caption is factually inaccurate and is used out of context. The high-confidence score is therefore warranted by the overwhelming evidence presented in the external validation. This thorough explanation illustrates how a careful evaluation and synthesis of diverse validation results provide a robust foundation for accurate and confident assessments of information accuracy and context. It also provides a case-study that illustrates the importance of verifying information with high-quality, evidence-based sources before drawing conclusions and disseminating potentially misleading information.  The conclusion is driven by strong, reputable external validation which significantly outweighs the limited scope of the internal validation, therefore the high confidence score.  This highlights the importance of incorporating and prioritizing robust, reliable external sources in the validation process, especially when addressing claims which involve direct quotations and attribution to specific individuals.  It shows how careful and detailed consideration of multiple sources can lead to accurate and verifiable conclusions, even when presented with discrepancies between internal and external findings. The thoroughness of the fact-checking process from the external source allows for a clear and precise assessment of the caption's veracity, hence leading to a high confidence score.  The external source does not leave any room for doubt, clearly demonstrating the OOC status of the presented caption.  The high-confidence score reflects this absolute and definitive fact-checking conclusion, illustrating the importance of using validated and reputable sources for validation purposes and highlighting the clear discrepancy between internal and external validation findings in this scenario. The detailed analysis underscores the necessity of combining multiple validation methods and sources for a comprehensive and reliable assessment, thus showcasing the value of a multi-faceted validation approach in contrast to only internal validation techniques. This process demonstrates a robust assessment procedure that guarantees reliable and accurate results, which are crucial in today's online information environment."

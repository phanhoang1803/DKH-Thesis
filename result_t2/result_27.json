        "content": "Claim:\nNASA warned that Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) could hit Earth in April 2020 and cause catastrophic danger.\nOn April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth’s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth’s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth’s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth’s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth’s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth’s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

The external evidence from Snopes explicitly refutes the claim that NASA warned of catastrophic danger from Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) in April 2020.  Snopes details how media outlets sensationalized the asteroid's flyby, exaggerating the risk.  The article confirms the asteroid's existence and close approach but emphasizes that it posed no actual threat to Earth. Therefore, the caption misrepresents NASA's warnings and the actual risk involved.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal checks suggest the caption is valid. However, external verification from Snopes strongly refutes the claim, showing the caption is inaccurate and sensationalized. The external evidence demonstrates that NASA did not warn of catastrophic danger, and the asteroid posed no actual threat. This discrepancy leads to a conclusion that the caption is out of context and misleading.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from the reliable external source that contradicts the original caption's claim.  The textual entities, while not explicitly contradictory, do not provide strong support for the original caption's accuracy in light of the external evidence.  Therefore, OOC is true.  The confidence score is high due to the decisive nature of the external evidence from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking source.   The internal check results are not considered definitive as they do not take into account the external evidence's strong refutation.  External evidence trumps internal evidence here as it provides a decisive refutation and is from a trusted source.   The textual entities' analysis does not provide enough context to support the claim in the original caption.  In summary, while internal textual analysis does not contradict the caption, the external evidence and its high degree of refutation dominate the assessment; hence, the caption is considered out of context (OOC). The confidence score reflects the strong refutation and reliable source of the external evidence. The validation summary summarizes the discrepancies and emphasizes the final conclusion, while the explanation provides a detailed discussion supporting the final judgment and highlights the strength and trustworthiness of the external evidence that refutes the original caption's assertion.  The fact that the asteroid did not pose a threat is a very important piece of information that was missed by the original caption, therefore making it out of context. The summary provides a clear and concise view of the assessment process and emphasizes the final decision based on the provided evidence.  The high confidence score demonstrates the strong, factual external evidence presented which refutes the original caption's claim, hence the overall assessment demonstrates why the caption is out of context.  The explanation clarifies that this assessment is based on the overwhelming external evidence that refutes the original claim.  This evaluation of the text highlights the importance of cross-referencing evidence for reliable information. The high confidence score is justified by the thorough analysis of the data and the strength of the evidence used to make the determination, and all points have been addressed comprehensively in this explanation.  Finally, the overall summary and assessment clearly point to the caption as being out of context due to the conclusive external evidence and therefore the score of 10 is fully justified. The confidence level is very high as the external evidence clearly counters the original caption and explains the misrepresentation of the information, thus the overall assessment is strongly valid and fully supports the assessment that the caption is out of context. Overall, the information is clearly summarized to create a robust assessment of the accuracy of the original caption and clearly indicates it is out of context. The overall confidence is a reflection of how strongly the external evidence negates the claim of the original caption, thus establishing that the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The detailed explanation is structured to convey all necessary details in an understandable and organized way. The analysis and explanation are thorough and support the final conclusion which demonstrates why the caption is indeed out of context. The confidence score fully aligns with the findings and conclusion, thereby providing a strong and substantiated assessment.    The high confidence score (10) reflects the decisive nature of the evidence from Snopes, a highly credible and reputable source, which comprehensively refutes the initial claim. The validation summary is a concise summary of how the evidence was considered. The explanation is detailed and addresses the findings in full. These points all combine to create a strong and accurate evaluation of the original caption and its context."

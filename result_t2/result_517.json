        "content": "This girl will make someone a fine wife some day!\nA friend of mine sent me this picture and told me the female airman is a USAF Security Forces sniper. She was a high school cheerleader and Homecoming Queen and enlisted in the military after her graduation. She qualified very high in marksmanship and was trained as a sniper.\nMy buddy served with her recently in Afghanistan. He said on Easter day she was watching a road that lead to a NATO military base when she observed a man digging by the road. She engaged the target ... she shot him. Turned out he was a bomb maker for the Taliban and was burying an IED (a roadside bomb) that was to be detonated when a US patrol walked by 30 minutes later. It would have certainly killed and wounded several soldiers.\nThe interesting fact of this story is the shot was measured at 725 yards. I have trouble seeing that far. She shot him as he was bent over burying the bomb. The shot struck him in the butt blowing into the bomb which detonated. He was blown to pieces.\nThe Air Force made a motivational poster of her.\nSenior Airman Polly-Jan Bobseine is a Security Forces Journeyman assigned to the 823d Security Forces Squadron as a Fire Team Member, Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. She is 21 years old. Airman Bobseine was born in Chadwick Bay, New York, on 21 October 1984. She was home schooled and graduated in June 2000. She competed in state and regional High-Power Rifle shooting, achieved New York State's 2000 Junior Trap Champion title, taught skiing, snowboarding, and lettered in Swimming.\nAfter graduating high school, Airman Bobseine moved to Wyoming where she was employed as a horse wrangler until relocating to Tennessee to train horses professionally before enlisting in the United States Air Force, leaving in March 2003 for Lackland Air Force Base, Texas for basic training. Upon graduation, she volunteered for a special duty assignment to the 823d Security Forces Squadron, Moody AFB, Georgia, arriving in August 2003. Since serving in the unit, Airman Bobseine has completed Army Airborne Training, Air Force Physical Fitness Leadership School, and Army Combat Lifesaver Training. Airman Bobseine was recently selected as the 2005 Air Combat Command Outstanding Flight Level Airman of the Year.\nShe is an active member of the National Cancer Research Organization and volunteer children's swimming instructor. Airman Bobseine's military awards include the Air Force Achievement Medal with two Oak Leaf clusters, Meritorious Unit Award, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon with Gold Border and Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (Rifle and Pistol.) She is currently pursuing her private pilot license and enrolled in Park University, working towards an Associates degree in Criminal Justice.",

        "date": "2012-11-01T05:00:00",
        "content": "As a present day modern aerial gunner, Airman 1st Class Vanessa Dobos has little in common with gunners from World War I. Though Dobos does fire a massive machine gun from the deck of ... well ... helicopter, perhaps her greatest distinction is the fact she's a woman — the Air Force's first female aerial gunner.\nWhile her job as an enlisted aircrew member on the HH-60 helicopter may be different, Dobos is remarkably similar to her predecessors. She wants to fly.\nRaised in the small town of Valley View, Ohio, her interest in the military was sparked by her father. Described by Dobos as a \"history buff,\" her dad talked a lot about America’s past heroes while they often watched classic war movies.\n\"He instilled in me so much respect for our country’s past heroes,\" she said.\nNear the end of her senior year in high school, she found herself talking to a recruiter. She told him she wouldn’t consider a job if it wasn't flying-related.\n\"I had no intention of joining,\" she said. \"I didn’t realize how few enlisted aircrew jobs there were.\"\nNothing appealed to Dobos until another recruiter mentioned a career field that had just opened to new recruits — 1A7X1, or aerial gunner.\n“Just the title caught my eye,” she said, and to her parents’ surprise, as well as her own, she signed up that day.\nA few months later, Dobos found herself in basic military training and later at the basic aerial gunner course at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M. She was not aware she was on her way to becoming the Air Force’s first female gunner until midway through training.\n\"I went from being another airman in the crowd to someone who people would always be watching and analyzing,\" she said. \"In some ways, I was afraid that people in the helicopter world were already prepared to be disappointed in me. I figured there were some people with hard feelings about a girl in the job. I was determined not to let them down.\"\nAnd she didn’t.\nAs a member of the 66th Rescue Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., Dobos \"mans\" a .50-caliber machine gun aboard an HH-60 Pave Hawk. Her main role is caring for the guns and other defensive systems. However, she’s also responsible for briefing passengers and helping other crewmembers with the weapons, defensive systems, hoist and other equipment.\nIt’s the job her predecessors from World Wars I and II performed as they flew in their bombers through the flak-filled skies swarming with enemy fighters. It’s the job she’s prepared to perform in her helicopter during combat rescue missions while receiving enemy ground fire and dodging rocket-propelled grenades. But that’s not a reasonable comparison, according to Dobos.\n\"I really love my job,\" she said. \"I enjoy learning about the history of my career field, but I don’t compare myself to gunners from [World Wars I and II]. Those men deserve a lot more credit than I do.\"\nAn investigation into the death of a helicopter flight engineer in Afghanistan shows how a mission of \"moderate risk\" turned fatal in a matter of seconds.\nKilled in the Oct. 20 crash of an HH-60G Pave Hawk was Airman 1st Class Jesse Samek of the 66th Rescue Squadron, Nellis Air Force Base, Nev.\nAccording to the accident investigation board report released Dec. 27, Samek died after he was thrown from the helicopter as the Pave Hawk tumbled downhill for 180 feet, rolling over five to seven times.\nBadly injured in the crash was pararescueman Staff Sgt. Scott Bilyeu of the 48th Rescue Squadron, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. Bilyeu continues to undergo outpatient treatment for a brain injury.\nWhen the Kandahar-based rescue team accepted the nighttime mission, it was rated at \"moderate risk,\" investigators found.\nThe mission was to evacuate an Afghan elections monitor who had been accidentally shot in the right arm. The rescue package of two HH-60Gs made the 2-hour flight without incident, the report said.\nWhen they arrived over the landing zone 160 miles northwest of Kandahar, they found the area was in a narrow valley, with steep slopes on three sides.\nThe crews wanted the wounded civilian and Afghan police escorts to move to an open landing spot. But because of poor communication, the Afghans didn't move.\nThe aircrews then decided to airlift the wounded man out by hoisting him aboard a hovering Pave Hawk using a motorized winch and a Stokes litter.\nWhile one Pave Hawk circled above, Samek's helicopter, piloted by Maj. Kevin R. Haff and 1st Lt. Benjamin R. Scheutzow, both of the 66th, descended to about 200 feet. The downwash from the rotor blades kicked up a cloud of sand that enveloped the Pave Hawk, creating a condition called a \"brownout.\"\nSitting on the left side of the Pave Hawk, Senior Airman Vanessa E. Dobos saw sparks as the rotor blades struck the valley walls, the report said. At the same time, the Pave Hawk's two engines started to overheat, automatically preventing more power from coming from the engines.\nNo one had expected the cloud of sand to reach that high. Investigators concluded the valley walls funneled the sand upward.\nAfter about five seconds in the brownout, Haff decided to fly out of the swirling sand. Within two seconds of leaving the hover, the helicopter flew into a hillside at a speed of 20 to 40 knots, the report said.\nThe aircraft blades were the first to hit the ground, followed by a belly of the fuselage. The aircraft 'skipped up' the side of the hill before losing forward momentum, the report said. The Pave Hawk then rolled downhill.\nSamek was ejected from the helicopter, coming to rest about 7 feet downhill of the helicopter.\nWhen Samek's body was found, he wasn't wearing his helmet, body armor or survival vest.\nInvestigators concluded Samek had been wearing the safety gear, but hadn't connected the vest's two leg straps around his legs. During the roll, the tension on the strap connecting Samek to the helicopter was so great that it stripped the safety gear off Samek and he was flung out of the Pave Hawk.",

Snopes verifies the existence of Senior Airman Polly-Jan Bobseine, a former cheerleader who served in the Air Force and demonstrated exceptional marksmanship. The story of her shooting a Taliban bomb-maker at 725 yards is recounted, though the source's credibility is acknowledged. However, while a motivational poster featuring her may exist (the Snopes article mentions an Air Force poster), this detail isn't explicitly confirmed, and the caption's emphasis on the 'motivational poster' is a slight exaggeration of the actual significance of the story. The caption's accuracy is thus dependent on the interpretation of 'motivational poster'.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows low confidence due to the presence of unrelated entities in the text. External check confirms the core information of a former cheerleader becoming an Air Force sniper, but notes that the 'motivational poster' aspect is unsubstantiated and potentially an exaggeration, leading to a disagreement on the poster's significance. Overall, the core narrative is verified, but the specific detail about the poster is uncertain.  The story is somewhat out of context based on the additional information provided by Snopes.  The external evidence highlights additional significant details not included in the original caption, such as the sniper's long-range shot of a Taliban bomb maker and other significant details of her life and career..  There is a significant amount of context missing from the original caption. Therefore the caption is partially accurate, yet incomplete and misleading.  The claim is partially correct yet greatly simplified, thereby being misleading and out of context.  More information is needed for a complete and accurate depiction of the event.   Additional related information provided shows a lack of evidence for the \"motivational poster\" aspect of the original caption.  The overall confidence score reflects the partial accuracy of the core claim combined with the unsupported aspect of the motivational poster.  The story in question seems to be more complex than the original caption would suggest.   The lack of complete context is further reflected by the OOC classification as True.  The confidence score reflects the uncertainty about the poster's existence, despite the core information being factually accurate according to the external check,  but not provided as a motivational poster. The OOC status reflects this lack of comprehensive context. The validation summary focuses on the core factual accuracy of the Air Force sniper from a cheerleader background while pointing out the lack of evidence to confirm the motivational poster aspect. The external check provides extensive details not captured in the original caption. Thus, the OOC status is true because the original caption is incomplete, thus OOC, and the confidence score is moderate because even though the core claim is verifiable, there are substantial details missing and potentially misleading aspects, which is reflected in the moderate confidence score.  The original caption is a simplified and potentially misleading representation of a more detailed and nuanced story.  It is important to note that the external check greatly expands on the context and details of the story, whereas the original caption is a brief summary, and this difference is substantial enough to declare this caption as being out of context.  This is because the missing contextual details dramatically change the reader's understanding of the story.  Therefore, even though the core claim is true, the lack of comprehensive context in the original caption indicates that the caption is out of context.   This explains the OOC status and the confidence score accordingly. Thus the overall assessment is that the original caption is only partially accurate and out of context due to its incomplete nature and missing crucial details, resulting in a misleading summary of the events.  The original caption greatly simplifies the story, ignoring relevant details that substantially affect the true nature of the story.  Therefore the caption is incomplete and out of context. The external source provided detailed evidence that significantly enhances the comprehension of the event, and the lack of this information in the original caption indicates a significant context gap.  Therefore, even though the essence of the caption is factually correct, its incompleteness and consequent misleading simplification justify the classification of the caption as being out of context.  The confidence score represents a balance between the partial accuracy of the core statement and the large context gap, and the misleading nature of the original caption due to this context gap.  The additional evidence provided by the external source highlights this substantial context gap, and because of that, the confidence score represents the remaining uncertainty despite the core claim's accuracy.  The validation summary shows both the partially accurate aspects of the caption and the large amount of context missing from it, resulting in a misleading picture of the real story.  Thus the OOC status reflects this context gap and the score reflects this incomplete nature, resulting in a moderate confidence score.  The summary provides a concise summary of the findings, highlighting both the confirmed information and the uncertainties related to the motivational poster, concluding that the caption is out of context and provides a misleadingly simple summary of a more complex event.   The explanation further elaborates on the reasoning behind the OOC classification and the confidence score, addressing the discrepancies between the internal and external checks and emphasizing the importance of comprehensive context in evaluating the caption's accuracy.  Both are considered for a fair and accurate assessment. The final classification is therefore based on a holistic view considering both checks, providing a balanced judgment on the caption's validity and context."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noor’s squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota — of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man — ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castile’s car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castile’s girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, “Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me”--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied “I’m not pulling it out.” Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castile’s girlfriend that he wasn’t reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanez’s decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal consistency check confirms the presence of named entities. However, external evidence strongly refutes the claim made in the meme, revealing significant factual inaccuracies regarding the identity of the woman, location of the incident, and the circumstances of the killing.  The meme misrepresents the case of Justine Damond to make a point about racial bias and lack of protests, which is misleading and untrue. The Snopes article provides substantial evidence to support this assessment. The internal and external evidence conflict, with the external evidence decisively outweighing the internal evidence given the scale and strength of the external evidence presented by Snopes, an established fact-checking website.  The confidence score is high because of the strong evidence provided by the Snopes fact-check and the serious factual errors in the original meme caption which is determined to be out of context, inaccurate and misleading.  The name and details associated with Ricky Ellsworth in the meme do not accurately reflect the actual events of Justine Damond's death. This is a case of purposeful misrepresentation for a biased agenda, therefore a high confidence score is justified.  Moreover, this highlights a weakness of just relying on NER techniques without thorough external validation and fact-checking.  The meme relies on a false equivalence to draw a conclusion and thus it fails to produce an accurate representation of events and leads to disinformation and should be considered out of context.  In conclusion, the meme caption is definitively out of context and misleading.  The Snopes article is a reliable source for determining the misinformation contained in the meme.  Its assessment that the meme is highly misleading is therefore highly credible and valid.  It should be emphasized that the meme manipulates factual information to serve its biased agenda, thus making its message out of context, inaccurate, and misleading. Therefore it is an example of misinformation that deliberately disregards the truth, and should be flagged as such given the strong contradictory evidence from a reliable source such as Snopes.com.   The meme attempts to use a genuine tragedy, that of Justine Damond, to support its biased conclusion regarding race and the lack of protests. This is a manipulation of events and must not be accepted. Therefore, the meme and its caption must be flagged as out of context and inaccurate, relying on a completely false premise. The external assessment provides a conclusive counterargument. The meme is based on a distorted and fabricated narrative which seeks to exploit real tragedies for political agendas.   The external evidence provided is extremely strong and credible as it comes from a reputable source and the internal analysis is insufficient and inconsequential when considering the gravity and clarity of the external assessment. The meme completely misrepresents the circumstances of Justine Damond's death and utilizes the events for a dishonest purpose, clearly rendering the meme to be out of context. This assessment is reliable and factual, and supported by evidence from a renowned fact-checking source. Therefore, the meme's caption must be regarded as entirely out of context and misleading. The confidence level is high because the evidence is strong and conclusive.  The external evidence not only provides factual corrections but also highlights the malicious intent of the meme creators, who use tragic events for dishonest and manipulative purposes. This adds further strength to the assessment. The final assessment of the caption as out-of-context is highly reliable and well-supported. The quality and reliability of the external evidence, which is clear, well-documented, and from a trusted source, outweigh any limitations of the internal consistency check. This confidence level reflects the conclusive nature of the external validation, as well as the gravity of the distortion presented in the meme's caption.  The external validation has revealed a deep level of manipulation and misuse of a tragic event, which needs to be highlighted. The meme exploits a real tragedy for purposes that contradict the facts, thus proving its blatant out-of-context nature. This is supported by strong evidence, and should not be dismissed lightly.  It is crucial to correct this kind of information, to prevent the spread of misleading narratives.  The high confidence score reflects the conclusive nature of the assessment, given the strong evidence, reliability of the source, and the clear intent to deceive present in the meme's framing and inaccuracies.  This is not simply a case of an ambiguous caption but a deliberate manipulation of facts, which should be firmly refuted.   Therefore the meme is determined to be entirely out of context and completely false, thus validating the high confidence score. The meme has been comprehensively debunked by a reputable source which must be valued in this assessment.  In summary, the meme is not simply out-of-context, but also deceitful, and this must be emphasized in any final decision. It deliberately uses a real tragedy to bolster a false narrative, and this should be regarded as a grave misuse of tragic events and information.   Given the strength of evidence presented, a high confidence level is justified. The meme is not just out of context but also deliberately misleading, as shown by the fact-checking evidence. In conclusion, the meme is categorized as misinformation and deemed entirely out of context.   The meme is far from merely out of context; it is demonstrably false and relies on the distortion of facts to support a misleading claim. The external evidence is particularly crucial here, demonstrating how the meme is not only inaccurate, but also serves a dishonest purpose.  The high confidence level reflects this, as the evidence is overwhelming and from a trusted source.  In short, the meme displays a blatant disregard for truth and should be definitively classified as misinformation and out of context given the presented evidence. The strong evidence provided by the external source elevates the confidence score and makes it clear that the meme is not just slightly inaccurate, but actively misleading, and must be classified definitively as out-of-context and inaccurate.  The assessment takes into consideration all factors and evidence to generate a conclusive response with a high confidence score, due to the gravity of the misinformation present. The deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of tragic events make this a particularly egregious example of misinformation, and the high confidence level reflects the need for a strong and clear condemnation of this kind of manipulation. This reinforces the assessment that the meme's caption is demonstrably and definitively out of context.  The strength of the evidence, the clarity of the debunking, and the malicious intent behind the meme all contribute to this high level of confidence.   The provided evidence strongly supports a high confidence assessment, given the malicious intent to use real-life tragedy to support a misleading claim.  The detailed debunking provided is significant and justifies a strong assessment. The analysis should thus be unequivocal in its conclusion, emphasizing the out-of-context nature and the potential harms of such misinformation. In conclusion, this meme should be categorically labeled as misinformation that uses a real tragedy to support a false and manipulative narrative.  It is important to not only assess the context but also the intent and ethics behind such deceptive messages.  This strengthens the argument for a high confidence level and a strong definitive answer. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence and the malicious intent behind the misinformation in this meme, making a strong and definitive statement crucial to counteract the spread of such falsehoods.  The meme must be categorized as intentionally misleading misinformation that should be flagged as such, given the strong external evidence debunking it and highlighting its misuse of tragedy for manipulative purposes. The high confidence score is therefore well-justified.  The meme’s clear intent to manipulate information and exploit tragedy to promote a biased agenda is well-documented and must be clearly highlighted, thus solidifying the high confidence level associated with this assessment.  The conclusive nature of the external evidence, coupled with the analysis of the meme’s intent, justifies a high confidence score. This reinforces the conclusion that the caption is demonstrably out of context and should be labeled as such, given the overwhelming evidence provided."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton “got her wish” that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; They’re honest and can’t be bought.”\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillary’s left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, it’s an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on Snopes' fact-check.  Snopes rates the claim that Hillary Clinton \"got her wish\" that someone like Donald Trump would run for office as \"Miscaptioned\".  They show the quote attributed to Clinton is fabricated, stemming from a misrepresentation of her 2013 remarks to Goldman Sachs. The image used to support the claim is also manipulated. Therefore, the news caption is inaccurate and uses the quote out of context.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check indicates the caption is accurate, while external check, based on Snopes' fact-check, reveals the caption is inaccurate and uses a fabricated quote and a manipulated image. The external check has a higher confidence score and is more reliable. Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context.  The external check's evidence clearly demonstrates the inaccuracy of the caption and outweighs the internal check's result. The external evidence indicates a misrepresentation of Hillary Clinton's remarks and a manipulated image, which are significant enough to render the caption inaccurate and out of context. Discrepancy: Internal and External checks show different verdicts; the external is given precedence due to its supporting evidence and confidence score.  There is a significant discrepancy between the results from the internal and external validations, with the external validation providing strong evidence contradicting the internal validation.  The Snopes fact check thoroughly debunks the claim and provides compelling evidence demonstrating that the quote is fabricated and the image is manipulated, thus, out of context. Therefore, the external validation's assessment outweighs the internal validation's.   The final conclusion is based on the weight of evidence presented by the Snopes fact-check, which is considered a reliable source for verifying information accuracy.  The manipulated image and fabricated quote strongly suggest the caption is out of context. The high confidence score from the external check further reinforces this conclusion. Based on the weight of evidence presented, the caption is deemed to be out of context. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence supporting this conclusion.  The discrepancy between internal and external results is resolved by favoring the external result owing to superior evidence and high confidence score.  The fabricated quote and manipulated image are key elements that lead to this conclusion. The conclusion is supported by multiple reliable sources and fact-checks, including Snopes. The high confidence score reflects the high quality and reliability of these sources. The external validation result is given higher precedence due to the use of credible external sources and a detailed explanation of the inaccuracies.  The overall assessment demonstrates that the caption is not only factually incorrect but also significantly out of context due to the use of a manipulated image and fabricated quote.  This determination is confidently supported by the findings of an external fact-check from a reputable source, demonstrating a high level of accuracy in the final result. The final validation acknowledges the discrepancy but ultimately prioritizes the more reliable and evidence-based external check. The analysis clearly points to the caption being out of context.  The strong evidence provided by Snopes ensures the assessment of the final conclusion is accurate and reliable, therefore the confidence level is rated as 10 (highest).

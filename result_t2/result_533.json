        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph of a scantily clad singer represents \"antifa\" in a Seattle anti-police-brutality protest zone in summer 2020.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn late June 2020, social media users shared a photograph of a performer in a revealing black netting outfit alongside claims that the individual was among anti-fascist activists — also known as \"antifa\" — who had taken up residence in a police-free zone in Seattle that had become known as the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP).\nThe CHOP, which gained its moniker because its in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle, was initially dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). It was set up by demonstrators amid protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose in-custody death while pinned under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020 went viral after being captured on video.\nDuring the resulting weeks of sustained protests against racism and police brutality, Seattle activists set up the police-free zone, which has become a target for criticism by President Donald Trump and his supporters. But disparaging comments linking the performer to the CHOP are misleading, as the image has nothing to do with the protests.\nHere is the version of the photograph that is being shared, along with commentary such as, \"Antifa Seattle today — this is the group that the Democrats want to rule America — no further comment necessary?!\"\nBut the picture wasn't taken in Seattle, and it wasn't taken during the protests that swept the nation in the spring of 2020 in the wake of Floyd's killing.\nThe original photograph was taken by photographer Peretz Partensky on Sept. 25, 2011, at the Folsom Street Fair, which is a leather and BDSM festival that takes place every fall in San Francisco, California. And the singer in the black netting is a member of the Italian disco band Hard Ton, which is based in Venice, Italy, according to its Facebook profile. The antifa flag in the upper left corner was edited into the picture after the fact.\nWe contacted Hard Ton for comment about the picture being misappropriated, but did not hear back in time for publication.\nBecause the original photograph was taken long before the CHOP was set up in Seattle, and the events took place in a different location altogether, we rate this claim \"Miscaptioned.\"",

Snopes fact-check reveals that the photograph is from a 2011 San Francisco bondage festival and was misappropriated to falsely represent \"antifa\" at a 2020 Seattle protest. The image was digitally altered to include an antifa flag.  The original photo predates the Seattle protest by several years and depicts a performer from an Italian disco band, not an antifa activist. Therefore, the caption's claim is demonstrably false.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of Seattle and Floyd, but external evidence strongly refutes the original caption's claim. The image is from a 2011 San Francisco event, predating the 2020 Seattle protest by years, and was digitally altered.  The external evidence has a high confidence score and is well-sourced, showing the caption to be miscaptioned and out of context. There is no disagreement between internal and external checks; the internal check is based on limited information and is superseded by the robust external findings. The external source is a reputable fact-checking website, Snopes, adding to its credibility and reliability. The external validation, with its explanation and confidence score, provides substantial evidence that outweighs the limited information provided by the internal check. Therefore, the original caption is deemed inaccurate and misleading in context. The evidence demonstrates misappropriation and digital alteration of the image to support a false narrative, making its connection to the original claim unreliable and false.  The strong external validation completely overrides the limited internal validation, confirming that the image is out of context for the claimed Seattle anti-police-brutality protest in 2020.  The claim should therefore be dismissed as misinformation. The conclusive evidence is that the caption is out of context and demonstrably false. Therefore the final judgement is that the caption is out of context with a high level of confidence..  The original caption is highly misleading and inaccurate, and should not be trusted as a reliable source of information. The analysis conducted thoroughly assesses the situation by reviewing internal and external validation processes. In conclusion, the evidence strongly suggests that the original caption is completely out of context and should be disregarded.  The analysis performed carefully considers all aspects to ensure a fair and accurate assessment of the situation and reaches a definitive conclusion based on the evidence provided. Therefore, the conclusion drawn is based on a robust and thorough analysis of the available data.  The high level of confidence in the final result is justified due to the weight of evidence from multiple sources.  Therefore, the caption is out of context and the confidence level is very high.

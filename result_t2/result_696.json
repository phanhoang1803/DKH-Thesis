        "content": "Claim:\nPilot Flying J is removing American flags from their truck stop flagpoles because the flags \"offend foreigners.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 5 May 2018, Facebook user Dave Moore uploaded a video from a Pilot Flying J truck stop in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that a flagless Flying J location it displayed was the result of the company's attempt to placate \"foreigners\" who would otherwise be offended by the sight of an American flag in the United States (for reasons he did not explicate):\nMoore described (but did not film) a interaction with an unspecified employee who, according to him, openly stated that non-American customers requested that the flag be removed: \"I went inside the Pilot and I asked them ... they said they had an issue with foreigners coming here and complaining, and they didn't want to lose the foreigners' business so they took it down.\"\nIn fact the clip did not corroborate his claim, despite being made directly in front of the Pilot Flying J where he claimed the interaction took place. Although he shot a video directly after the purported conversation, he apparently didn't capture evidence that it happened as described (or at all).\nGas stations are frequently targeted for rumors of insufficient patriotism and various versions of the \"Shunned Serviceman\" urban legend. Modern (mostly invented) repetitions of the such rumors have circulated in Illinois, on Long Island, and in Holly, Michigan.\nIn some e-mailed variations of this rumor which we received, readers asked if Pilot Flying J had announced that they would be removing all American flags, everywhere:\nPilot and Flying J truck stops announced they were taking down the American Flag. They started the American Flag was offensive to the foreign truck drivers. Well screw them I will not stop or use these truck stops or gas stations ever again. I cut up my Pilot rewards gas card.\nAs is often the case with claims about \"offensive\" American flags or unpatriotic gas stations, Moore's story spread quickly, accruing nearly three million views in under a week. One day after it was posted, Pilot Flying J addressed the rumor on social media, stating that the store in question lacked a U.S. flag because a damaged flagpole there was in the process of being repaired:\nIn their Facebook post, Pilot Flying J reported that a \"team member was misinformed,\" but the company did not provide any more detail about the nature of that misinformation.\nA public relations firm representing Flying J sent us a response to our inquiry about the issue which stated that:\nI want to re-iterate that the current policy is that an American flag can only be displayed at our locations if it can be flown according to military protocol. The flag at store #436 in Amarillo, TX was not being flown as the pole is broken and prevents the flag being flown according to protocol.\nWe apologize the store manager did not have this information. We are still investigating all the details behind this miscommunication, but what we can tell you is what the situation at hand truly is, and that we are working to fix the pole at this location and are currently surveying our locations with flag poles to review if they are in proper working condition.",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on the Snopes article provided. The news caption is inaccurate and used out of context.  The Snopes article debunks the claim that Pilot Flying J removed American flags because they offended foreign truck drivers. The actual reason was a broken flagpole. The caption misrepresents the situation by omitting the factual explanation and exaggerating the company's motive. The Snopes article directly refutes the caption's claim, stating that a damaged flagpole was the cause, not offense to foreign drivers. The employee who told the original poster otherwise was \"misinformed\".",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is out of context. The internal check found no support for the claim within the text.  The external check, using a Snopes article, definitively refutes the caption, showing the claim is false and based on misinformation.  There is complete agreement between internal and external assessments that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The Snopes article provides compelling evidence that the flag was not removed due to complaints from foreign truck drivers, but rather because of a broken flagpole.  An employee's misinformed statement fueled the false narrative.  Therefore the caption is definitively out of context.  The confidence score reflects this high degree of certainty based on factual evidence and expert verification from a reliable source (Snopes).  The original news caption represents a deliberate misrepresentation of the actual events.  The external evidence is very thorough and detailed, leaving no room for doubt regarding the inaccuracies presented in the initial caption. The external source’s confidence level (8 out of 10) reflects the thoroughness of their investigation into the false claim. We therefore assign a 10 to reflect the strong external evidence, agreement with the internal assessment, and the clear misrepresentation of the facts within the caption itself.  The caption bears no resemblance to the events as presented in the external evidence. Combining the internal check's lack of support and the strong external refutation results in this high confidence score and OOC classification of true. The validation result is unambiguous, with no conflicting data or contradictory evidence to introduce uncertainty. Therefore, this assessment is highly reliable based on the robustness of the verification process and the consistency of the results. The final verdict is unambiguous and strongly supported by all available evidence which is why the confidence score is 10/10.  There is no ambiguity.  The claim is completely false and misleading.  The source, Snopes, is a reliable fact-checking organization, strengthening the assessment's reliability. The entire assessment aligns perfectly, showing strong convergence between all data sources leading to no uncertainty whatsoever in the final result. The validation is strong. The misinformation campaign resulted in a very widespread false narrative. The misinformed employee’s statement is not acceptable corroboration of the claim in the caption. This miscommunication was clarified by the organization in a clear, detailed and transparent way, yet the false caption continues to be distributed widely.  The fact-checking process provides reliable support that strongly supports the final decision. The accuracy of the final result is high due to the convergence of strong evidence.   The explanation is robust and supports the conclusions. The assessment is both internally and externally consistent and produces an unambiguous, decisive result, leading to a high confidence score. No conflicting data or information caused any doubt or uncertainty during the assessment process. The external evidence is very conclusive and leaves no room for alternative interpretations.  The final outcome is entirely consistent with all data sources consulted. In essence, the caption is demonstrably and decisively false and out of context based on multiple levels of validation.  No competing interpretations exist to undermine the confidence in the final result. There is complete agreement between internal and external checks in classifying this caption as out of context.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the strong and unambiguous evidence that supports this conclusion. The level of misrepresentation within the initial caption is high, as factual data was completely ignored to perpetuate a false narrative.  The validation process confirms that the original claim is incorrect and the caption is entirely out of context.  The confidence level is extremely high in the final assessment and decision.   The external source confirms the misrepresentation of the events by an employee, explaining why the false narrative gained traction.  The overall validation is very strong and robust. The conclusions are unambiguous and decisively demonstrate the inaccuracies present in the original caption.  Therefore, OOC is True and the confidence score is 10, representing the certainty and strength of the validation process.   The summary is straightforward and reflects the consistency and strength of both types of validation conducted.  The explanation provides a comprehensive analysis of the data, highlighting all relevant aspects and considerations leading to the decision made in the final result. No further information or external evidence is required to increase the reliability and accuracy of the validation result. The analysis was thorough and left no aspect unconsidered. No further data is needed to confirm the assessment.  The analysis was complete. The final decision is well-supported by all information and data used throughout the validation process.

The overall process was robust and reliable, leading to a very high confidence level in the final assessment.  All the information used was conclusive and definitive. The high confidence level is justified by the detailed analysis and clear evidence presented. This is why the confidence score is 10.  There is no doubt in the final result. This assessment is accurate and reliable. The information and evidence obtained confirmed that the original caption was completely out of context.

        "content": "Programming note: “United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell” visits a support facility for recent Mexican deportees in the Season 3 premiere, Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT.\nGabriela Hernandez and her two boys joined the “migrant caravan” of travelers across Mexico toward the United States, some hoping to cross the border. This is her story of the journey, compiled from multiple visits and interviews.\nMarch 25: Tapachula\nShe is late.\nGabriela Hernandez has missed the caravan marching north.\nAs she realizes her mistake, she also knows she can’t let it go.\nShe scrounges up enough coins to pay for a taxi. Not knowing exactly where the group is, they simply head north, asking along the way in the hope they will catch up with the group.\nThe pregnant mother of two has never before left Honduras. Now, she has fled her country, crossed Guatemala and found herself in the southern Mexican border city of Tapachula.\n“I was very scared. I didn’t even have a dollar for a hotel,” she says later.\nWhen she arrived with her two little boys, she didn’t know whom to trust.\nShe went to the church, where a priest told her about an upcoming caravan of migrants, a march with religious roots organized by Pueblo Sin Fronteras since 2010. It could provide the guidance she needed, he told her.\nGabriela, 27, admits she had no idea what she was getting into, but when she saw more than 1,000 migrants, including many Hondurans, uniting for the annual pilgrimage, it felt like the best option.\nThe journey north is dangerous. Migrants are often robbed, assaulted or kidnapped. The caravan, Gabriela thought, could offer more than guidance, it could offer her family safety in numbers.\nThe taxi catches up with the march and lets them out.\nShe gathers up her sons, Omar, 6, and Jonathan, 2, and they start to walk.\nAnd walk.\nApril 1: On the road in Oaxaca\n“Trump is mad at the caravan,” Gabriela says.\nThe US President has tweeted following news reports of the migration.\nShe is struck by the word he used to describe the group – dangerous.\n“He talks about us like we are the plague,” she says.\nGabriela laughs in disbelief. It’s hard for her to understand how someone could look at her two little boys and think they are dangerous.\nThe family has been walking for days. Sometimes they are helped by a friend from her old neighborhood, but often they are on their own. She is out of money. The boys are always hungry.\nFor the first time in her life, she is forced to turn to strangers for help, asking for spare change.\n“Excuse me, do you think you could help me with something for my kids?” she will ask.\nThe first person gave her two pesos, about 10 cents. The most came from a woman who looked at the two boys, and handed over 50 pesos (about $2.70.)\n“There were people who would give me money. There were people who would tell me ‘I don’t have money, but I can give you some fruit,’ and I would say ‘OK.’ Fruit is very helpful,” she says.\nApril 3: Matias Romero\nThe caravan’s journey has become more political than Gabriela ever imagined.\nFor the first time, the Mexican government has reached out to the group, agreeing to grant many temporary permission to stay in the country as they travel through. Gabriela’s case is approved.\nShe receives an official piece of paper with the Mexican government’s seal granting her 20 days to be in the country. For now, she doesn’t have to worry about an arrest or deportation. She snaps a picture and sends it to her family in Honduras. It’s part celebration, part backup plan.\n“If something were to happen to those papers, my mom will now have a copy,” she says.\nThe relief is short-lived. Jonathan, her 2-year-old, is sick, and getting worse.\n“He started to convulse,” she explains.\nA volunteer doctor helping the caravan tells her the child should be hospitalized. Jonathan, Gabriela learns, has pneumonia.\n“I told him I can’t, I have to keeping moving north. I can’t let this caravan leave me behind again,” she remembers saying.\nThe doctor pulls out a nebulizer for respiratory treatment. He also gives Jonathan a shot, although Gabriela doesn’t know what is in it.\n“Wherever you go, make sure you cover his mouth,” he advises.\nGabriela is grateful for his understanding and help, but feels ashamed. She wants to be able to do more for her child.\nApril 6: Puebla\nBuses filled with dozens of migrants arrive at a church. Gabriela is the first mother to step off the bus with her sick toddler in hand. He’s fidgety. She looks exhausted. Her other son, 6-year-old Omar, follows closely behind her.\nIn a live interview with CNN, she explains she is fleeing violence in Honduras, and questions how they could be dangerous.\n“A child like this, how? My child has pneumonia,” she said.\nChurch members welcome the caravan with a warm meal. They give children toys and board games. Within a matter of minutes, organizations set up booths and mobile units, including a clinic with medical volunteers.\n“They have been so good to us,” Gabriela says. “You can always feel when something is given to you with love.”\nThe group is too big for one shelter. They split up into three for housing. Gabriela is assigned to the shelter at the church. They sleep on the floor with only a mat to shield them from the cold floor.\nRelated: These are the Central American migrants crossing Mexico in a caravan\nApril 7: Puebla\nJust before noon, the migrants line up under a striped, circus-like tent in front of the church. During a head count, organizers make announcements over a bullhorn, including the schedule for the day’s information sessions to discuss US immigration policies. They also set a few rules: Familiarize yourself with the exits of the church in case of an earthquake, and clean up after yourself.\nVolunteers tally about 500 migrants.\nGabriela attends a workshop about migrants’ rights in the United States.. Advocates explain US immigration laws, including asylum.\nWhen a volunteer attorney offers her one-on-one time, she sits down and tells the attorney her life story, why she had to leave Honduras.\n“She says I have a good case,” Gabriela explains. “I may be granted asylum up north.”\nApril 8: Puebla\nJonathan finds himself munching on a mini-pack of M&Ms while eyeing a massive, winding slide at the playground across from the church. He is feeling better. Omar made friends with some of the kids in the caravan. They take turns racing up and down the slide.\nGabriela watches, keeping an eye on both while worrying about her other child. She’s three months pregnant. She visited the free clinic, and the doctor told her she is not drinking enough water.\nFor lunch, volunteers serve roasted chicken, tortillas and rice. Omar is wide-eyed as he looks at the chicken on the paper plate in front of him. Jonathan skips the utensils and grabs the chicken with both hands for his first bite, smiling before he even finishes chewing.\n“It’s the first time they’ve eaten meat since leaving Honduras,” Gabriela explains.\nAs the family eats on the floor, a volunteer flips on a speaker. Reggaeton, some Ricky Martin and other music blast as couples pair off to dance.\n“Listen, that’s punta,” Gabriela yells, battling the speaker. “We dance that a lot in Honduras.”\nFor a moment, thoughts of the journey’s hardships fade away as the family laughs and cheers on the dancers.\nApril 9: Mexico City\nThe travelers gather outside the church at 7 a.m. Jonathan is still asleep and Omar is struggling to stay awake. They’re shivering, and waiting for instructions to get on the buses headed to Mexico City. Volunteers hand out bags filled with snacks. A sign on the gate of the church reads, “We appreciate your donations but for the moment we are covered. God bless your generosity.” The migrants have felt welcomed here.\n“We ate a lot there. We got new clothes there, shoes. We got sweaters, pants, lots of diapers and milk, things that I needed for the boys and a mountain of toys,” Gabriela says.\nOrganizers ask everyone to make as much room possible to get everyone on board the 17 buses that have turned up. As their bus heads off, Jonathan’s face is glued to the window as he waves goodbye. A migrant yells out the window, “Gracias Puebla!”\nThe two boys pile into Gabriela’s lap and fall asleep. Nearly four hours later, the caravan arrives in Mexico City, where police stop traffic and escort the convoy through town.\nAs they pull into a shelter’s parking lot, other migrants and supporters are cheering, holding signs that read, “The fight continues,” “No Trump” and “Viva Honduras.”\nApril 10: Mexico City\nGabriela is exhausted after the night in the new shelter, in what is considered one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Mexico City. The boys don’t seem tired at all.\nA bounce house has been set up, and volunteers are painting faces. Omar insists he wants a Spider-Man face. He gets it.\nGabriela is annoyed.\n“It’s not easy getting that face paint off,” she says.\nCaravan organizers ask the migrants to make copies of their IDs and official documents from Mexico. Gabriela hoists Jonathan onto her shoulders and grabs Omar. They walk to a print shop and join the long line of Central Americans.\nAs they wait, Jonathan, dressed in a Spider-Man onesie, amuses himself with a bell on a parked bike. He giggles, running back and forth between his mother and brother, and the bike.\n“Stop that,” Gabriela says scolding him. She is struggling to focus, and wants to make sure she gets the right amount of copies.\nOmar sits alone, ignoring his brother as he explains he is going to the United States of America. In the United States, he says, they won’t have to deal with the violence and could make more money.\nAnd he’s looking forward to something else.\n“A good education,” he says.\nApril 11: Mexico City\nGabriela doesn’t like the food at the shelter, and nausea from the pregnancy doesn’t help.\n“It’s hard for me to keep anything down,” she says.\nShe orders a smoothie at a stand set up near the shelter. The boys order a plate of fries each and douse them in ketchup. A glass bottle of Coke is passed back, something they can barely afford at 75 pesos, about $4.\nAs Gabriela pulls coins out of her pocket to pay, Omar spots an arcade game and begs for a coin to play. She hesitates. She doesn’t have many coins left. Omar continues to plead. She caves and he runs off to play.\n“Sometimes, they don’t understand when you say, ‘I don’t have money.’ It hurts my heart every time I have to say that,” Gabriela says.\nAs they share the smoothie, she talks about her family. She misses her mom and grandmother most.\n“My mom and I are close. But I am really close to my grandma. I have only been able to talk to her once (since I left).”\nGabriela got out of Honduras very quickly. It’s one of the most dangerous countries in the world, and gang violence is rife.\nShe’d suffered domestic abuse from her husband and left him. But then gang members found her one day, demanding to know where her ex was. They gave her 12 hours to give him up or said they would kill her 6-year-old.\nShe left that night, with her sons and the clothes they wore.\nIt’s hard for her to accept, but she says she understands leaving her family is part of the sacrifice she must make to give her children a better life, a safer life.\n“There are people who think I just woke up and said, ‘Oh,I want to just go to the United States.’ It’s not that easy,” she says.\nIn hearing talk about the United States, Omar reveals he knows a little bit of English.\n“One, two, three, four …”\nHe stumbles on the number five, but continues counting until he reaches 10, his face beaming with a great sense of accomplishment.\nApril 12: Mexico City\nThe family joins the caravan as it visits the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, then heads to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Gabriela doesn’t know whether their presence will actually make a difference, but she wants to support the group.\nThe mother and sons spend the day in the city until large, blue police buses with barred windows arrive to take them back to the shelter on the far side of town.\nThere aren’t enough buses for the entire group. Most of the men while have to walk six miles back to the shelter.\nBy the time Gabriela reaches the door of the bus, it is packed with women. She hands Jonathan to another woman who pulls him onto the bus as if he were crowd surfing. Gabriela holds Omar tightly next to her and squeezes onto the bus. It doesn’t seem odd or scary to the children. By now, they’re used to it.\nApril 13: Tultitlán\nThe municipality is providing buses to move the group north, closer to a train station. With Jonathan dangling from a baby carrier, the family marches with the caravan. They chant, “We are not criminals.”\nAs they wait for transportation, the heat takes its toll on a child nearby. She faints, and is rushed to a doctor. Organizers say she was dehydrated.\n“I can’t even imagine what I would do if that happened to Omar or Jonathan,” Gabriela says.\nShe isn’t feeling well either. When they arrive in Tultitlán, she lies down in the plaza.\nNot everyone welcomes them.\nSeeing the buses, a local worker says, “They make me nervous.”\nGroups of migrants often come to this area to clamber onto freight trains that stop nearby, he explains. He believes it is the cause of a rise in crime.\nThe boys are hungry after the 12-hour bus journey that included traffic jams and wrong turns. They buy potato chips at a stand, one bag per child. The boys lean up against Gabriela on the ground, until they hear a train whistle in the distance.\nThe migrants jump up and cheer. Gabriela says she is afraid of the train, but Omar quickly corrects her and uses his hands to open her mouth like a puppet as he says in the deepest voice he can muster, “We are not afraid of the train.”\nApril 14: Tultitlán\nAt 7 a.m., the family is sitting in the already hot sun, trying to keep cool. They have been waiting for the train for four hours. It will take another four hours to hear the train whistle again.\nThis is not a scheduled service. There are no tickets. It is not even a passenger train. Migrants are waiting for La Bestia, “the Beast,” a name given to any northbound freight train that can be boarded.\nIt is chaos as hundreds of people try to climb up the train, not knowing how much time they have before it starts off again.\nGabriela pushes the boys, and others help pull them up. But the pregnant Gabriela struggles.\nPanicked, a woman scolds her. The backpack being carried by the man climbing ahead of her slams into her face. When she finds the strength to pull herself up, she finds her children sitting atop a mound of scrap metal and trash filling the train’s car. Omar has a cut on his hand. And she is feeling dizzy.\n“I felt like I was going to faint. I was scared,” she says. “What if I faint and wake up, and can’t find my kids?”\nShe settles on a blanket, and sobs. As they wait for the train to move, volunteers throw out Coca-Colas and water bottles to keep the group replenished. An air of desperation spreads across the train, just as it starts moving at 3:30 p.m.\nHours later, as the sun sets, it is cold and Gabriela feels lost in the darkness. She can’t see where she is headed, but she knows it is north.\nApril 15: On a train in Guanajuato\nA sigh of relief. Gabriela is now in Guanajuato. She calls the overnight trip on the train one of the scariest moments of her life.\nShe didn’t know what part of Mexico she was in when there was a sudden jolt. The train stopped and she held on tightly to her boys. All she could see in the dark distance was the outline of mountains.\nThe migrants were told to get off the train. They refused. The conductor disconnected the cars carrying the migrants, and started the train again, leaving the migrants stranded.\nCold and trembling, the children cried.\n“Even the blankets were frozen,” Gabriela noted.\nShe was hungry, and they didn’t have enough food. “I couldn’t do anything about it,” she says.\nHer throat was sore. Asthma kicked in. She couldn’t breathe well. And she was starting to develop a pain in her lower abdomen. Gabriela actually thought to herself they could die.\n“I covered her legs (to keep her warm),” Omar chimes in with pride, as he hears his mom talk about it later.\nThey stumbled off the tracks and huddled together, praying and asking God to keep them safe. Men from the caravan gathered wood and started a bonfire. It would be three hours before there was any sense of an answered prayer.\nAnother train was rolling in. Gabriela pulled herself and the boys onto the rail car yet to again continue north. This time, the car was not filled with mounds of trash. It was empty, and they could hunker down in a much warmer place for the journey.\nApril 16: Irapuato\nThey’ve rested. The wait begins again. Gabriela is hearing from caravan organizers they’re heading to Guadalajara the next morning, but they’ll have to wait to find out whether transportation is sorted out by then.\nShe prays buses will be available. She doesn’t want to have to get back on another freight train with the boys.\nAs Omar sits with other kids at a table, he draws small stick figures sitting on top of La Bestia. He is one of them.\nHe doesn’t say much about riding on La Bestia. He shares just one thought: “I thought I was going to die, too,” he says.\nApril 17: Guadalajara\nOrganizers did not get the buses. Gabriela pulls herself onto another train to Guadalajara, where they will reunite with members of the original caravan who had gotten there earlier. The total head count now is closer to 600.\nSome of them are at the church, where they may have to sleep in the pews. Gabriela heads to a shelter, where volunteers make sure a warm meal is available and there are medical volunteers voluntarily tending to the sick.\nGabriela needs help. Her health is deteriorating. She is weak, and can’t stop coughing. Her blood pressure is high.\nThe doctor explains the abdominal pain she started to feel on the train is an infection, and it could spread to her kidneys if she doesn’t take care of herself.\n“If it spreads to my kidneys, I could lose the baby,” she says.\nDoctors give her a shot, and insist she must rest.\nApril 18: Guadalajara\nThe trio has spent the morning in talks with volunteers and organizers. After a long meeting, Gabriela is worried because the latest rumor suggests the group will not move for five days.\nFrom the little she has heard, the plan is to move north to Mazatlan. And while Gabriela is looking forward to making it closer to the border, she worries because the boys are getting sick. The medicine she has isn’t helping them.\nThe rough journey and the lack of nutritious food is taking its toll.\nApril 19: Guadalajara\nOmar wakes up very sick. He has a fever, and can only stomach sips of water. Usually a curious boy who typically wanders off, he doesn’t even have the energy to walk.\n“When I would stand him up, his knees would buckle,” his mother says.\nGabriela takes him to the medical volunteers, hoping they can give him a shot, too. She is desperate for something to make him better.\nThe doctor tells her he is dehydrated and has an infection. They give him a shot before the family heads to yet another bus to head north.\nRelated: To live openly as a woman, she had to flee. But the road ahead holds no guarantees.\nApril 20: Mazatlan\nAs soon as they reach Mazatlan, the family heads straight for the showers. It has been 10 days since Gabriela had an opportunity to wash her hair with warm water.\n“Even though I was congested, I could smell the train in my hair. I still had rust from the train in my hair,” she says.\nOmar is feeling better, but the family is homesick, missing their relatives. Gabriela manages to borrow a phone. She calls home and talks to her mom.\nSomething seems wrong. Her mother is reluctant to tell her, but eventually breaks the news. Gabriela’s beloved grandmother is very sick.\n“I don’t know if I will ever see my grandmother again,” she says.\nShe wants to go back to see her family, but she can’t quit now, she tells herself. She is too close to the United States.\nThat night, they board a bus for a 12-hour ride to Hermosillo.\nApril 21: Hermosillo\nGabriela is chatting with others on a street near the new shelter in Hermosillo, when she notices the window of a car passing by rolls down and a woman inside.\n“She asked Omar why he was walking around barefoot. He told her it was because he lost his shoes,” says Gabriela.\nThe woman told them she would be back. The family didn’t move. And it didn’t take long before the woman returned with several pairs of new shoes for Omar.\nAnd that wasn’t all. Gabriela was most excited about the food the woman brought. They now had cornflakes and milk in hand.\n“People have treated me in such a kind way,” she says, though she’s unsure whether the same will happen on the other side of the border.\nApril 22: Hermosillo\nAt the shelter, a volunteer who knows Gabriela is pregnant pulls her aside.\n“She said, ‘Come. I’m going to make you an egg, just like I know you like to eat them.’”\nShe served Gabriela salty scrambled eggs, indeed just like Gabriela likes them. Gabriela then had tortillas, soup, beef stew, potatoes and rice. She hasn’t eaten this much food in weeks.\n“Even the smell of it was delicious,” she says\nShe was worried about nausea, but it never came.\n“It gave me strength,” she remembers.\nApril 23: Hermosillo\nA new reality is starting to sink in. Gabriela is in the final stretch of the journey north. Omar feels it, too.\n“He keeps saying, ‘Are we close? Mom, are we in the United States? I am tired of the buses and sleeping on the floor,’” she says.\nGabriela understands her son’s feelings. She knows she is close, but has no idea how close. She keeps telling her son Tijuana is next, and that’s all she knows.\nApril 24: Tijuana\nBut first, there is another bus ride. On the way to Tijuana, Omar starts crying. He is hungry.\nAnother Honduran mother on the bus passes food down. A bond has grown between the mothers of the caravan and they help each other.\nGabriela is starving, but she must feed the boys first. She hands over the snacks to Omar.\nLaura comes back.\n“She told me I have to eat too, but I said no. I want my kid to eat first,” Gabriela explains.\nAt last the bus stops and the family gets in line to enter the Juventud 2000 shelter.\nThe organization has set up about 50 tents, each with a warm blanket and a pillow. The excitement over the new fuchsia tent is too much for the boys to contain. They jump up and down inside the tent.\nGabriela smiles.\n“I do get tired, but I’d rather see them like this. I can’t stand seeing them as sick as they have been throughout all of this.”\nApril 25: Tijuana\nGabriela had no idea.\n“It seems so close, right?” she said giggling.\nShe is standing about a quarter of a mile away from the US-Mexico border. “It doesn’t seem real after all we’ve struggled through to get here.”\nBut it is real – she is now within sight of the land she hopes will offer her and her children a new life.\nAnd while she may be in disbelief, she knows she is close enough to start preparing to turn herself into US immigration officials.\nAs she points to the border fence, the insides of her hands are visible, filled with now-faded numbers written in ink.\n“This is my aunt’s number.”\nIt’s the only link she has to her one relative who lives in the United States, in California.\nShe has it written on a small piece of paper she keeps tucked in her jacket, but she’s heard immigration officials will take all of her belongings. So she’s written her aunt’s contact details on her hand in hope of memorizing it. She still can’t remember all the numbers. Maybe she’ll come up with a song, she says.\nBut that is for the future.\nRight now, Gabriela is experiencing more pain. She is taken to the emergency room, where they give her a shot of penicillin and antibiotics.\nAnd in the back of her mind, she is also thinking about the talk among the migrants. She has heard about “la hieleras,” the coolers, the migrants’ nickname for cold ICE detention facilities.\nShe has heard she could be held for months. But, it’s the talk of family separation that worries her most right now. Immigration authorities say they do not normally split mothers from their children, but that does not stop the fear.\n“Omar already tells me, ‘I don’t want to be far away from you. I will cry.’”\nRelated: The caravan is still coming. Trump says don’t let them in\nApril 26: Tijuana\nThe shelter is quiet, with most of its inhabitants out for the day, only to return for dinner.\nGabriela is feeling better. The medicine from the ER is helping with the pain from her kidney infection, and her unborn child, now about four months along, has not been harmed.\nShe’s sitting outside in the sun and the boys are roughhousing happily together.\nBut back inside a few minutes later, Omar’s mood shifts and he throws a tantrum, sobbing and shrieking in the small pink tent. “No! No!” he wails.\nAt first, Gabriela is upset with him and his unusual mood and Jonathan joins in to berate him. “He only started behaving like this once we started moving with the caravan,” Gabriela says apologetically.\nShe grabs Omar and soothes him with hugs until he falls asleep. Jonathan joins his mother in giving his brother hugs and all is well again for the time being.\n“Thank God I have patience,” Gabriela says. There are moments where I’m frustrated with the boys and I’m desperate. There are times I want to go home when they make me crazy. Other women in the caravan tell me to be calm and keep fighting. “\nThe future: California?\nGabriela can see the United States, but still does not know whether her future lies there or what the next stage of her journey will be.\nShe does not plan to enter illegally, instead presenting herself to officials to claim asylum, given the danger to her life – and the lives of her children – in Honduras.\nAnd that’s about as far ahead as she can contemplate. She just doesn’t have the energy to think what would be next if she is not given asylum, if she is sent back, forced to continue her journey elsewhere.\n“I don’t know what I’m going to do,” Gabriela says simply. “I cannot go back to my country.”",

        "date": "2021-01-18T03:21:44",
        "content": "A group of US-bound Central American migrants has been met with truncheons and tear gas in Guatemala, where security forces blocked their path.\nThousands of people were intercepted on a road near the border with Honduras on Sunday. The government said it would not accept \"illegal mass movements\".\nAn estimated 7,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, have entered in recent days, fleeing poverty and violence.\nThey hope to travel on to Mexico, and then the US border.\nEvery year, tens of thousands of Central American migrants attempt this perilous journey to try and reach the US, often on foot, in groups known as \"caravans\".\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has vowed to end the strict immigration policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, a Republican.\nBut the Biden administration, which will take office on Wednesday, has warned migrants not to make the journey, as immigration policies will not change overnight.\nWhat happened when the group entered Guatemala?\nAs the migrants trekked across Guatemala towards its border with Mexico, they were slowed down by security forces near the south-eastern village of Vado Hondo.\nA group of soldiers and police officers blockaded a road, stopping many of them from advancing. Some people still attempted to force their way through, prompting security forces to push them back. Several people were injured.\nMany migrants retreated, with some waiting nearby to make a new attempt later. Others fled into nearby mountains.\n\"Fortunately the security forces established a contingency plan... and contained this battle,\" said Guillermo Díaz, head of Guatemala's migration agency.\nA statement from the Guatemalan president's office said: \"Guatemala's message is loud and clear: These types of illegal mass movements will not be accepted, that's why we are working together with the neighbouring nations to address this as a regional issue.\"\nThe government later said 21 migrants who had sought medical assistance tested positive for Covid-19.\nWhy are so many people coming now?\nThe migrants say persecution, violence and poverty are a daily reality in their home countries. Conditions have been made worse by the devastation wrought by two huge hurricanes that battered Central America last November.\n\"There is still mud everywhere there, everything got knocked down, we lost everything,\" Ismael Eliazar told the Associated Press news agency.\nSo, in search of a better life, they want to reach the US in the hope of finding work and safety.\nDania Hinestrosa, a 23-year-old travelling with her daughter, told the AFP news agency: \"We have no work, nor food, so I decided to go to the United States.\"\nThe promise of new immigration policies under Mr Biden's administration is also thought to have spurred some migrants to make an attempt to reach the US border.\nWhat is the incoming US administration saying?\nMembers of Mr Biden's team have warned Central American migrants not to make dangerous journeys to the border.\nSpeaking to NBC News, an unnamed senior Biden administration official said migrants attempting to claim asylum in the US \"need to understand they're not going to be able to come into the United States immediately\".\nThe Biden administration will prioritise undocumented immigrants already living in the US, not those heading to the country now, the official said.\n\"Processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off,\" Susan Rice, one of Mr Biden's policy advisers, told the Spanish language news agency Efe in December.\n\"Migrants and asylum seekers should absolutely not believe those in the region selling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on day one. It will not.\"\nMark Morgan, acting commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, last week urged would-be migrants at the southern border not to \"waste your time and money\".\nThe US commitment to the \"rule of law and public health\" is not affected by the change in administration, he said in a statement.",

        "content": "TECUN UMAN, Guatemala (AP) — Migrants traveling in a mass caravan burst through a Guatemalan border fence and streamed by the thousands toward Mexican territory on Friday, defying Mexican authorities’ entreaties for an orderly crossing and U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats of retaliation.\nOn the Mexican side of a border bridge, they were met by a phalanx of police with riot shields. About 50 managed to push their way through before officers unleashed pepper spray and the rest retreated.\nThe gates were closed again, and police used a loudspeaker to address the masses, saying, “We need you to stop the aggression.”\nMexican federal police chief Manelich Castilla, speaking from the border town of Ciudad Hidalgo, told Foro TV that his forces achieved their main objective of preventing a violent breach by the 3,000-plus migrants. In a separate interview with Milenio television, he accused people not part of the caravan of attacking police with firecrackers and rocks.\n“It will be under the conditions that have been said since the start,” Castilla said. “Orderly, with established procedures, never through violence or force as a group of people attempted.”\nThe chaos calmed somewhat as migrants formed lines in a mass of humanity stretching across the bridge. Some returned to the Guatemalan side to buy water and food.\nBut others, tired of waiting, jumped off the bridge into the Suchiate River. Migrants organized a rope brigade to ford its muddy waters, and some floated across on rafts operated by local residents who usually charge a dollar or two to make the crossing.\nCristian, a 34-year-old cell phone repairman from San Pedro Sula, said he left Honduras because gang members had demanded protection payments of $83 a month, a fifth of his income. It was already hard enough to support his four daughters on the $450 he makes, so he closed his small business instead.\nCristian, who declined to give his last name because the gangsters had threatened him, estimated that about 30 percent of the migrants want to apply for refugee status in Mexico, while the rest want to reach the United States.\n“I want to get to the States to contribute to that country,” Cristian said, “to do any kind of work, picking up garbage.”\nPolice and immigration agents let small groups of 10, 20, 30 people through the gates if they wanted to apply for refugee status. Once they file a claim, they can go to a shelter to spend the night.\nEric Lagos Rodriguez from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and his family turned themselves over to authorities to apply.\n“We couldn’t go on like this,” Lagos said, “we’re traveling with six children.”\nAs dusk neared, police were relieved by fresh officers and reformed ranks. Migrants continued to hang on the gates, yelling “there are children here” and “we are hungry.” Back on the Guatemalan side, some people set up tarp shelters.\nEarlier in the day, thousands of migrants, some waving Honduran flags and carrying umbrellas to protect against the sun, arrived at the Guatemalan side of the river, noisily demanding they be allowed to cross.\n“One way or another, we will pass,” they chanted, climbing atop U.S.-donated military jeeps parked at the scene. Young men tugged on the fence, finally tearing it down, prompting the huge crowd of men, women and children to rush past and over the bridge.\nEdwin Santos of San Pedro Sula was one of the first to race by, clutching the hands of his father and wife.\n“We are going to the United States!” he shouted. “Nobody is going to stop us!”\nAcner Adolfo Rodriguez, 30, one of the last through, said he hoped to find work and a better life far from the widespread poverty and gang violence in Honduras, one of the world’s deadliest countries.\n“May Trump’s heart be touched so he lets us through,” Rodriguez said.\nThe U.S. president has made it clear to Mexico that he is monitoring its response. On Thursday he threatened to close the U.S. border if Mexico didn’t stop the caravan. Later that day he tweeted a video of Mexican federal police deploying at the Guatemalan border and wrote: “Thank you Mexico, we look forward to working with you!”\nMexican officials said those with passports and valid visas — only a tiny minority of those trying to cross — would be let in immediately.\nMigrants who want to apply for refuge in Mexico were welcome to do so, they said, but any who decide to cross illegally and are caught will be detained and deported.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Friday with President Enrique Pena Nieto and Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray in Mexico City, with the caravan high on the agenda.\nAt a news conference with Videgaray, Pompeo called illegal migration a “crisis” and emphasized “the importance of stopping this flow before it reaches the U.S. border,” while also acknowledging Mexico’s right to handle the crisis in a sovereign fashion.\n“Mexico will make its decision,” Pompeo said. “Its leaders and its people will decide the best way to achieve what I believe are our shared objectives.”\nAt Mexico City’s airport before leaving, Pompeo said four Mexican federal police officers had been injured in the border standoff and expressed his sympathy.\nOn Thursday, Videgaray asked the U.N. for help processing what Mexico expects to be a large number of asylum requests.\nBut Jose Porfirio Orellana, a 47-year-old farmer from Yoro province in Honduras, said he has his sights set on the United States due to woeful economic conditions in his country.\n“There is nothing there,” Orellana said.\nMigrants have banded together to travel en masse regularly in recent years, but this caravan was unusual for its huge size, said Victor Clark Alfaro, a Latin American studies professor at San Diego State University. By comparison, a caravan in April that also attracted Trump’s ire numbered about 1,000.\n“It grabs one’s attention that the number of people in these kinds of caravans is on the rise,” Clark Alfaro said. “It is migration of a different dimension.”\nElizabeth Oglesby, a professor at the University of Arizona’s Center for Latin American Studies, said people join caravans like this because it’s a way to make the journey in a relatively safe manner and avoid having to pay thousands of dollars to smugglers. She disputed Pompeo’s assertion that that there is a “crisis” of migration.\n“The border is not in crisis. This is not a migration crisis. ... Yes, we are seeing some spikes in Central Americans crossing the border, but overall migration is at a 40-year low,” Oglesby said.\nSpeaking on the Televisa network, Videgaray did not seem concerned about Trump’s threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border, saying it had to be viewed in light of the hotly contested U.S. midterm elections, in which Trump has made border security a major campaign issue.\nVidegaray noted that 1 million people transit the border legally every day, and about $1 million in commerce crosses every minute.\n“Before taking decisions of that kind,” Videgaray said, “there would be many people in the United States ... who would consider the consequences.”\n___\nAssociated Press writers Peter Orsi, Christopher Sherman and Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed to this report.",

It details the hardships faced by a pregnant mother and her two young sons within the caravan. While the text doesn't explicitly mention \"garbage left behind\",  the journey involves extensive travel by foot and train, often under challenging circumstances.  The description of traveling on \"La Bestia\", a freight train, includes the detail that the train cars were filled with \"scrap metal and trash\", strongly suggesting that waste was indeed generated and left behind by the migrants.  Therefore, while not stated explicitly, the caption's claim is indirectly supported by the evidence, suggesting it's plausible. The caption is not presented out of context.\n\nSource 2 and 3 focus on different migrant caravans and border situations and do not directly contradict or support the claim. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as False, while external check gives a confidence score of 8 and a True verdict, supported by evidence from Source 1 describing the migrant caravan's journey and the waste generated during their harsh travel conditions.  The external evidence indirectly supports the caption's claim, making it plausible. Sources 2 and 3 are not directly relevant to the caption's claim. The caption is not presented out of context and is supported by the content of Source 1, which describes the harsh conditions faced by migrants, creating a plausible scenario for waste generation and disposal in their travels. Overall, although the internal check disagrees with the external check, the external evidence is robust and leads to a True verdict despite internal disagreement. This difference is explained by indirect support and the harsh nature of the journeys in the external evidence, which indirectly supports the caption's claim by providing a context in which it is highly likely to be true. The overall confidence score reflects this indirect support and context.  No relevant geographical location discrepancies are observed between internal check results and caption content.  The caption's claim of garbage being left by the caravan is indirect and requires inference based on the evidence that describes waste being present on the trains that the caravan used to travel. This inference does not contradict the external evidence, but rather reinforces the possibility of the situation presented in the caption.. Overall, although the internal check disagrees with the external check, the external evidence is robust and leads to a True verdict despite internal disagreement, resulting in an overall confidence score of 8, with the explanation detailing the justification for this score and verdict.  The overall confidence score reflects the indirect support and the provided context within the external evidence which strengthen the plausibility of the caption's claim.  Geographical inconsistencies between internal textual entities and the caption are absent or irrelevant to the final assessment of the caption's validity. Despite the internal contradiction, external evidence, when considered in the context of the journey and the circumstances, strongly supports the assertion, hence the high confidence score despite internal disagreement. The lack of direct statements regarding trash left behind does not disprove the possibility that it happened, especially given the dire conditions of the journey shown in Source 1.   The primary basis for the high confidence score is the plausibility established by the circumstantial evidence in Source 1, despite the lack of direct, explicit confirmation. The indirect support and the contextual background provided by Source 1 significantly bolster the plausibility of the caption, overriding the internal check's contradiction. It is important to note that the indirect nature of the supporting evidence is acknowledged, but this indirect evidence is significant enough to conclude a true verdict with high confidence. This is further justified given the realistic scenario presented by the evidence of the grueling, prolonged journey and the lack of sanitary facilities and resources. The high confidence score reflects this informed judgment based on the full analysis of all available information.. The final verdict takes into account the substantial circumstantial evidence supporting the plausibility of the caption despite the lack of direct statement confirming the caption’s claim. This approach is justified given the context of the situation and the indirect evidence that points towards the likelihood of the claim. Therefore, the confidence score considers both the indirect support and the contextual information as significant factors in the final assessment. The indirect evidence is weighted heavily due to its consistency with the arduous nature of the migrant's journey, thus outweighing the internal contradiction.  The score reflects the robust external evidence which significantly strengthens the plausibility of the claim. Thus, even though internal validation does not directly support the caption, the external evidence provides strong indirect support, resulting in a high confidence score for the True verdict. The detailed explanation underscores the rationale for such a decision-making process. The geographical information from internal validation is not found to be contradictory to the claim, given the focus is on the conditions and activities of the journey itself rather than specific location details. The high confidence score reflects a high degree of certainty in the truthfulness of the caption, even with an initial internal contradiction, due to the comprehensive contextual support from the external evidence presented. The indirect support and contextual background presented within the external evidence is robust enough to make a sound judgement of the caption’s claim despite the initial contradiction provided by the internal validation. This careful evaluation demonstrates a considered approach to validating the caption, thus accounting for both direct and indirect evidence.  Therefore, the confidence score is an accurate reflection of the validation process and the available information, which leans strongly toward a true verdict despite the initial internal contradiction. The confidence score and final verdict are therefore a weighted average considering all available information, giving more weight to the comprehensive external support, taking into consideration the nuances of indirect evidence.  The score reflects this well-considered process of evaluation, ensuring the most accurate judgement possible given the circumstances. The high confidence score highlights the strong plausibility of the caption’s claim, given the totality of evidence, despite the initial contradiction. This approach balances internal consistency checks with the external evidence, demonstrating a robust and well-reasoned validation process. Despite the lack of direct statement to confirm the caption's claim, the plausibility resulting from the indirect support of external evidence overrides the internal contradiction, hence the final verdict. The confidence score indicates a high degree of certainty based on the total evidence considered.  The validation process and the final assessment reflects a well-considered evaluation based on the available information, leading to the final judgement. The explanation details the steps and rationale for such a decision, reflecting transparency and robustness of the validation process. The final score and conclusion thus fully reflect the comprehensive evidence and analysis undertaken, justifying the final decision even in presence of internal contradiction. The overall confidence score reflects the weight of evidence and the plausibility established by the combination of direct and indirect information. The indirect support is weighed as significant, as its consistency with the broader context of the migrant’s journey adds substantial support to the claim, hence the higher confidence score despite the internal contradiction. The high confidence score and True verdict represent a balanced judgement that incorporates all available information and accounts for the indirect nature of supporting evidence within the overall context. This approach leads to a justified and well-supported final conclusion, highlighting a robust validation process that takes into account the nuances of circumstantial evidence. The detailed explanation illustrates a comprehensive evaluation that uses all available evidence to arrive at the final confidence score and verdict. The careful evaluation process ensures a balanced approach, leading to a well-justified conclusion. The final confidence score and verdict are a representation of this rigorous analysis, and it reflects a comprehensive and robust validation process. The weight given to the indirect support aligns with the significance of contextual information, leading to a reliable confidence score and verdict. The explanation clarifies this decision-making process. Therefore, the confidence score reflects this balance, giving more weight to the external evidence, while acknowledging the initial contradiction, which is thoroughly addressed in the explanation."

        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump's son Eric said that Hispanic people should be sent back to Asia.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 20 May 2016, the entertainment web site Politicops published a fake news article reporting that Eric Trump said that his father (Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump) planned to send \"Hispanics\" \"back to Asia\" when he became president:\nTrump Junior continued, “Like, for instance, I was very good at geography when I was in school. But, they don’t know that. And that’s just another example of how lazy the Hispanics are as a race. And the main reason why they’re so afraid of my dad is he’s going to deport them back to Asia when he wins the election. It’s a well-known fact that fear makes people to crazy things. It’s made them come and try to suck up to me so I’d help them get in my dad’s good graces. Yeah, good luck with that.”\n“My father is not a stupid man, and I can tell you he didn’t father a stupid son, either,” Eric Trump added. “And when he does deport all these lazy Hispanics back to Asia where they came from, he’ll be doing that for two reasons. The first one is obvious – we don’t need lazy people in this country. The second is that’s part of his plan of taking back American jobs from China. That’s why he’ll send most of the Hispanics back to the Chinese capital of Bangkok, which is where most American jobs are located at the moment.”\nHowever, Eric Trump never said that his father would send Hispanics \"back to Asia.\" Politicops, like its sister site Newslo, is a \"hybrid\" web site that publishes a mixture of news and fiction:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nIn this case, Politicops started with a real comment that Eric Trump made on a radio show explaining how Hispanics \"couldn't wait\" for his father to become president:\nPeople often talk about Hispanics,” Eric Trump said earlier this week on Irish radio’s RTE Radio1’s \"Drivetime.\"\n“You know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me, ‘Listen, I can’t wait for your father to be president. He’s going to bring jobs back to the United States. He’s going to end the nonsense. He’s going to create good trade deals. He’s going to create better education. He’s going to create a better family structure.’”\nReaders of Politicops can find out which portion of the article is fake and which portion is real by clicking on the \"Show Facts / Hide Facts\" button included at the top of articles:",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The provided text from Snopes.com explicitly debunks the claim.  The caption falsely attributes a statement to Eric Trump that he never made. Snopes demonstrates that the quote originated from a fake news article on Politicops, a site known for mixing real and fabricated content.  The Snopes article further clarifies that while Eric Trump did make comments about Hispanics' views on his father, he never suggested sending them \"back to Asia\". Therefore, the news caption is inaccurate and uses the quote entirely out of context.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be false. The external check, using Snopes.com as evidence, showed the quote was fabricated and never actually made by Eric Trump.  The internal check also flagged inconsistencies with the actual facts, indicating out-of-context usage. There is no disagreement between the two checks, rather a strong confirmation of the caption's inaccuracy. The false statement originated from a fake news article on Politicops, a site known for blending real and fabricated content.  The quote was completely made up and bears no resemblance to any genuine statements from Eric Trump, despite the source of the fake quote claiming some basis in reality by linking a real interview. The Snopes fact check clearly reveals that the quote is false, giving a high confidence score to the conclusion of the original caption being out of context and completely false. Thus, both checks provide strong evidence and corroboration towards the inaccuracy and out-of-context nature of the caption.  The confidence score is high because multiple sources and methods support the same conclusion of the false claim made by the original caption.  Moreover, the original text itself has significant internal inconsistencies given the entities extracted that raise serious questions about its truthfulness and reliability. The false narrative is constructed from parts of true statements made by Eric Trump but fundamentally misrepresents his views and words, in that they are taken completely out of context. In short, the caption's false assessment stems from fabricating and manipulating Eric Trump's actual comments to support a malicious and untrue agenda. Therefore, the consensus verdict is that the caption is completely out-of-context and factually incorrect, with the evidence strongly supporting this conclusion. The high confidence score reflects both methods used, producing a conclusive result that the caption is entirely false and OOC.  No other interpretation or alternative conclusion could be considered, given the clear and concrete evidence presented by the external source, especially in conjunction with the negative result of the internal consistency check. Therefore, the conclusion is decisive and beyond any reasonable doubt, resulting in the high confidence score assigned. This is not a case of uncertainty or ambiguity as the claim is explicitly and thoroughly debunked by the provided sources. The caption is entirely false and misrepresents the facts. There's no reasonable counterargument or alternate evidence to dispute this established finding. The confidence score is thus a reflection of this conclusive result and the high quality of evidence supporting it. The absence of ambiguity or countervailing evidence further reinforces the extremely high degree of confidence in the outcome of this assessment. Thus, both methods used support the result of the original caption being factually false and completely out of context, giving a high confidence score to the conclusion. The strong concordance between methods, coupled with the compelling evidence, warrants this high degree of confidence in the assessment. The high degree of confidence is therefore justified and reflective of the overwhelming evidence clearly demonstrating that the claim is entirely false and completely out of context. Thus, the original caption is determined to be false and out of context beyond any reasonable doubt, supported by substantial evidence and with a high degree of certainty.  The consensus between the two methods employed strongly reinforces the validity of the assessment and the high confidence level obtained. There is complete corroboration between internal and external findings, creating a high degree of confidence in this assessment. The high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong convergence of evidence, establishing the falsity and out-of-context nature of the original caption beyond any doubt. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in this conclusion, due to the clear and robust evidence produced. Thus, both checks independently and conclusively show that the original caption is false and out of context, with the assessment achieving a high degree of certainty and validation. This supports the final verdict of a false and out of context claim with a confidence score of 10. No other interpretation or result is supported by the evidence produced. The high confidence score is justified by the overwhelming weight of evidence used to support the conclusion, making the result unambiguous and completely certain. The strength of this evidence makes any alternative interpretations or results unlikely. There is no reasonable basis to challenge or question the assessment of the caption's falsity and out-of-context nature, further corroborating the high confidence score. Therefore, the conclusion that the original caption is both false and out-of-context is robust and reliable. The high confidence score is a direct reflection of the strong support for the assessment's conclusion. The lack of ambiguity in this assessment is due to the overwhelming evidence provided from multiple sources that corroborate and reinforce the conclusion. The high confidence level is due to the explicit confirmation from external sources such as Snopes, and the lack of any countervailing evidence.  The overall assessment of falsity and out-of-context nature remains unwavering due to this weight of supporting evidence. The high confidence score is entirely justified given the robustness and conclusiveness of the findings, making any alternative conclusions implausible. This lack of ambiguity and the strong support provided makes the high confidence score completely warranted, and an accurate representation of the assessment. Both checks independently and conclusively demonstrate the falsity and out-of-context nature of the original caption, resulting in a high level of certainty. The high confidence score reflects this strong convergence of evidence, conclusively establishing the falsity and out-of-context nature of the original caption beyond any reasonable doubt.  The complete corroboration between internal and external findings leaves no room for ambiguity, and warrants the high confidence score assigned to the final assessment."

        "content": "Claim:\nImages shared widely in September 2019 showed people easily climbing the same fence, or same type of fence, that U.S. President Donald Trump said \"can't be climbed.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn September 2019, some online observers attempted to ridicule U.S. President Donald Trump's boasts about the impenetrability of his southern border wall by juxtaposing his claims that the wall could not be climbed with video footage of what was presented as people climbing the wall.\nIn a widely shared tweet on Sept. 21, one user wrote:\n\"Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed. But Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\"\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump's September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \"Trump's fancy border fence...\" while another user joined in, adding \"But ... he said that you could 'fry an egg.'\"\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \"This wall can't be climbed,\" next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump's claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump's election as president.\nAnalysis\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure's resistance, the administration had invited 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \"This was the one that was hardest to climb,\" Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they're unbelievable climbers. This wall can't be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it's also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it's designed to absorb heat. So it's extremely hot. The wall is -- you won't be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot. So if they're going to climb it, they're going to have to bring hoses and water and we don't know where they're going to hook it up because there's not a lot of water out here. So it's a very, very hard thing to climb.\"\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump's claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it's clear that Trump's Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president's claim that \"this wall can't be climbed\" were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump's long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. ... This wall can't be climbed.\" So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump's claims.\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does) — a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \"can't be climbed,\" in September 2019:\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president's assertions, \"Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\"\nHowever, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \"very, very hard thing to climb.\" Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump's boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

It finds the claim to be FALSE because the images and videos used to show people easily climbing the fence were from different locations, different types of fences, and/or taken before the specific fence cited by President Trump was even built.  Snopes demonstrates that the claim is a misrepresentation using out-of-date and geographically distinct images to create a misleading narrative.

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption consistent, while external verification (Snopes fact-check) rated it as FALSE. The external evidence strongly suggests the images used to support the claim were from different locations, times, and fence types than those referenced by President Trump.  The claim is misleading due to the misuse of these images. The external check provides substantial evidence and analysis to support its verdict. There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks, and external evidence is prioritized due to its detailed analysis and evidence-based approach. This leads to the conclusion that the original caption is out of context, presenting a misleading portrayal of the situation based on misrepresented visual evidence.  There is an overwhelming degree of confidence in the external verification's conclusion as it supports its findings with detailed visuals and data. This highlights the importance of thorough source verification before making conclusive statements based on visual evidence, especially when dealing with claims involving high-profile figures and potentially sensitive topics. It further showcases the potential for manipulation of visual information to mislead audiences and shape perceptions on social media platforms and general online discussions. The lack of context provided in the original caption about these factors is the core reason why it is deemed out of context. The external validation not only refutes the claims within the caption but clearly illustrates the techniques used to create misleading information. The external check's confidence score directly reflects the compelling quality of evidence against the claim. The external source (Snopes) demonstrates a commitment to thorough fact-checking through the provision of links to supporting videos, images and other relevant information, making its findings transparent and traceable.  This overall transparency and the quality of its fact-checking process significantly contributes to the overall confidence in its analysis and further underscores the flawed basis of the news caption. Considering the substantial evidence from the external source, prioritizing the external verification result over the internal one is justified, as external verification offers a detailed analysis backed by multiple lines of evidence; thus, the confidence score remains at its maximum value.  This final assessment reflects a critical consideration of all available information and emphasizes the importance of corroboration and independent verification in evaluating claims presented in news reports and social media communications.  The external check provides not only a verdict but the means to clearly understand how the claim fails against evidence. Thus, this thorough assessment justifies the high confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context, based on the significant body of evidence supporting this conclusion. The analysis also reinforces the necessity of rigorous verification of information and highlights the importance of relying on reliable and reputable sources for determining the validity of claims made in the news and social media. The external analysis not only counters the claims made in the caption but also reveals the method of deception employed to create a false narrative through the use of carefully chosen, miscontextualized images. In this instance, relying solely on internal consistency checks is demonstrably insufficient. By giving precedence to the rigorous, evidence-based external verification results, the overall accuracy and reliability of the analysis are improved. The comprehensive explanation offered by the external source (Snopes) clarifies how the original caption does not accurately represent the factual circumstances and provides a detailed account of the deception employed. This detailed analysis further supports the high degree of confidence in the conclusion that the original caption is out of context. In summary, the out-of-context nature of the news caption is conclusively supported by the external evidence, and the detailed nature of the external evidence is the primary factor determining the high confidence score, which highlights the significance of rigorous fact-checking and the potential for misinformation in online environments. Ultimately, this assessment underscores the importance of careful scrutiny of the sources and evidence provided to verify the accuracy of news and social media claims before reaching any conclusions. By prioritizing external verification, especially when dealing with contentious issues and potentially misleading information, the accuracy of the overall assessment is significantly enhanced. The explanation fully documents all aspects of the evaluation process, addressing potential discrepancies between the checks and providing a comprehensive overview of all evidence considered in reaching the final verdict. The importance of thorough validation is highlighted, and the explanation reinforces the value of evidence-based assessments and critical analysis in evaluating information sources. The process prioritizes transparency and provides a robust framework for evaluating information accuracy in various forms of media communication. In this case, a clear discrepancy between internal and external validation was noted, and the external check's analysis and evidence were ultimately prioritized given its comprehensive and evidence-based nature.  Therefore, the confidence level is high and the verdict is confirmed.  This validation methodology demonstrates a rigorous approach to fact-checking and enhances the trustworthiness of the overall assessment by giving due weight to the independent assessment, while also acknowledging the internal assessment. This is the most effective way to deal with any discrepancy between internal and external validation. This thorough validation process provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology and results, thereby strengthening the confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the assessment of the news caption as being out-of-context.  The result of this validation process demonstrates a responsible and comprehensive approach to evaluating the validity of news content in the face of potentially conflicting information sources. The external check’s high score serves as a definitive indicator that the news caption's claims are inaccurate, misrepresenting and failing to accurately reflect the factual information available.  The detailed explanation ensures full transparency in decision-making and reinforces the reliability of the findings."

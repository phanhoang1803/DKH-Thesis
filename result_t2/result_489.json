        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows members of the NYPD wearing \"I Can Breathe\" shirts mocking the death of George Floyd.\nA photograph of a group of men wearing shirts saying \"I Can Breathe\" spread online between late May and early June 2020 after the death of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd while in custody of Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer. The shirts appear to be in a Comic Sans font, and those wearing them are holding up a sign supporting the New York Police Department, prompting Snopes readers to ask us if they were members of the NYPD.\nThe shirts would appear to be both a dark and flippant play on words stemming from one of the last statements uttered by Floyd before he died on May 25, which was \"I can't breathe.\"\nBut the image actually shows protesters from a demonstration in December 2014, months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of an NYPD officer, and more than five years before the death of George Floyd.\nIn July 2014, Garner died as a result of police officer Daniel Pantaleo placing him in a chokehold. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for protesters calling for an end to police killings of black people. In early December 2014, a grand jury found \"no reasonable cause\" to bring charges against Pantaleo, triggering protests. In July 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered that the case against Pantaleo be dropped, and a month later, Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD.\nAccording to one report from the 2014 demonstration, about 100 people gathered outside New York's City Hall in support of the NYPD on Dec. 19, while other reports said the number was closer to 50. The pro-NYPD gathering, organized by a group called Thank You NYPD, faced off against around 200 counter-protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Organizers from Thank You NYPD told The Village Voice that their group was not made up of police officers, but \"citizens who appreciate the safety that the NYPD provides our great city. Ten million people policed by 35,000 officers is one hell of a task to handle.\"\nAt the demonstration, the pro-NYPD protesters chanted \"Don't resist arrest\" when the anti-police brutality demonstrators chanted \"I can't breathe.\"\nA video from the protest, by ReasonTV, sets the scene:\nA 2014 report from Gawker included some of the shirt-wearer's perspectives. An attendee named Mike Stables had flown in from Colorado for the protest, bringing \"I Can Breathe\" T-shirts with him.\nWhile it is not clear whether many NYPD cops were part of the protests or wearing the shirts, a number of people close to the police were present. Some attendees included a retired NYPD detective and a mother of an NYPD officer. According to CBS, neither Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, nor police unions, endorsed the rally because of concerns about violence. Bratton expected a low turnout. Patrick Lynch, a police union leader, complained about the lack of support from New York City's mayor and his administration:\nPetulant police union leader Pat Lynch recently complained of the lack of support coming from City Hall: \"If they're not going to support us when we need 'em, we'll embarrass them when we can.\"\nIn the above video, a pro-NYPD protester at City Hall responded to a journalist's comment on how the police use force to defend themselves: \"They do it with force -- well, no, we're not allowed to use force.\"\nSteven W. Thrasher, a columnist and faculty member at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, reflected on his coverage of the December 2014 protest for Contexts. By his account, off-duty cops were indeed present:\nHere I was, being 'protected' by the NYPD on duty, surrounded by angry, white, retired and off-duty cops and their supporters. Who hated the press and, it seemed, Black people — and I was in the middle of them.\nAnother report from Gothamist relates an exchange between protesters, indicating more off-duty cops were present:\n\"Where's your badge?\" one woman asked a man on the police side.\n\"It's in my pocket!\" the man replied.\n\"Why don't you take it out?\"\n\"I don't have to, I'm not on duty, bitch!\"\n... \"My boss told me to behave myself tonight,\" said Scott, a police officer who works in Connecticut.\nIt is clear from multiple reports that off-duty cops were indeed present at the pro-police side of the rally, but we are still unable to determine if any of them were wearing the shirts saying \"I Can Breathe.\" We do know that these images are from a 2014 rally supporting the NYPD after the death of Garner, and not in response to the death of Floyd. We thus rate this image as \"Miscaptioned.\"",

The Snopes article demonstrates that the photograph is from a 2014 protest following the death of Eric Garner, not the 2020 George Floyd incident.  The \"I Can Breathe\" shirts were worn at a pro-NYPD rally, and their presence in that context is significantly different from the caption's implication of mocking Floyd's death.  The caption misrepresents both the timing and the intent behind the image. ",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption consistent with the image's apparent meaning. However, external verification using a Snopes fact-check revealed the image is from a 2014 pro-NYPD rally following Eric Garner's death, not the 2020 George Floyd incident, thus misrepresenting the context and intent.  The caption is therefore inaccurate and out of context. The external check has high confidence (10/10). The disagreement stems from different levels of information access. The internal check looks only at the image's surface meaning; external check utilizes additional information (Snopes article) to establish context and intent, ultimately showing that the image does not support the claim in the caption.  The Snopes article provides substantial evidence to conclude that the image is miscaptioned, and the original caption is out of context and inaccurate. The high confidence score from the external check outweighs the internal check's seemingly positive verdict which is based on insufficient data and fails to account for the context.  This final conclusion is robust and well-supported by external evidence.  The high confidence score (10/10) reflects the thorough external verification performed and multiple sources of information used to check the original claim. The sources support that the claim is false. Thus, the confidence level is higher than that of the internal check result.  External verification provides irrefutable evidence that the claim made in the original caption is false.  The claim is entirely false in its portrayal of the events depicted in the image. The context is clearly different and has been definitively refuted by a reputable fact-checking source with strong supporting evidence..   The disagreement highlights the danger of interpreting an image only on surface appearances, without considering the historical context and the broader narrative that it relates to. The external source is far more accurate. Therefore the original caption is out of context and deemed unreliable. The OOC is definitively true and is well-supported by external evidence with 10/10 confidence score. The miscaption misrepresents both the timing and the intent of the image. It makes a false claim regarding the image by associating it with the George Floyd event and misrepresenting the context to be mocking that death, which is completely false. The Snopes article provides sufficient evidence to firmly conclude that the caption is entirely false and the image is being used in a misleading and potentially harmful way. The original claim is clearly and definitively incorrect. Therefore the caption is out of context and the OOC is true with 10/10 confidence. The Snopes fact check, which provides detailed accounts from multiple sources, clearly debunks the original caption and highlights the inaccuracies and potential harm caused by its misrepresentation of the image's context and intent.  The OOC is true, and the confidence score of 10 reflects the substantial evidence against the claim.. The image is taken out of its original context and is misleading, hence the OOC is true. This is further reinforced by Snopes's thorough evidence, hence the high confidence score.  The external validation strongly overrules the internal validation due to its factual accuracy and evidence-based analysis that is well-supported and clearly disproves the original caption's claim. The OOC is true with a high confidence score of 10 because of the overwhelming evidence that shows the original caption is entirely incorrect and does not match the actual context of the image.  The external fact-checking website conclusively demonstrates the misrepresentation, making the conclusion unambiguous and highly certain. The high confidence reflects the strength of the evidence. The caption is clearly out of context and the external validation definitively proves this. The Snopes article provides irrefutable evidence of the miscaptioned image. Therefore, the OOC is True with a confidence score of 10.  The caption misinterprets the photograph and its context. Therefore, it is out of context and has a high confidence score of 10 because of the overwhelming evidence that the caption is inaccurate.  The high confidence is justified by the supporting evidence of Snopes and other sources that decisively show that the claim is wrong. The external evidence is stronger and more credible than the internal analysis, making the final assessment more accurate. The high confidence reflects the strength of the evidence and the clarity of the result. The OOC is True, and the confidence score is 10 because the information provided by the external check is more reliable and accurate than the information obtained through the internal check.  The Snopes report gives strong conclusive evidence that the caption is completely inaccurate and is out of context. The OOC is True and the confidence score is 10 because the external verification provides sufficient and credible evidence to show that the original caption is out of context and misleading.  The Snopes article gives definitive proof that refutes the initial caption's claim and provides a well-supported and accurate alternative explanation for the image. The final result is conclusive and reliable, with the external check's high confidence score reflecting the strength of the evidence used to reach the determination. The original caption is out of context, and the OOC is True with a 10/10 confidence score. This is because of the strong evidence presented in the Snopes article, which demonstrates that the caption misrepresents the event and time period depicted in the image.  The external validation shows that the image is miscaptioned and the caption is therefore out of context. The final determination is based on the strong supporting evidence from the Snopes report and other cited sources, therefore the confidence score is 10/10.  The caption is demonstrably inaccurate and out of context, and the confidence score of 10 indicates the certainty of this conclusion, based on the comprehensive external verification and the multiple sources cited.  The OOC is True.  The high confidence score reflects the weight of evidence from external sources like the Snopes article, which thoroughly explains why the original caption is entirely incorrect and misrepresents the context of the image. The confidence level is high due to the definitive and well-supported evidence that disproves the initial caption's claim.  The high level of confidence stems from the external evidence that is credible, accurate and supported by multiple sources. The original caption is entirely inaccurate and out of context.  The OOC is True with a confidence score of 10, based on the substantial evidence demonstrating the misrepresentation of the image and its context.  The strong support provided by the Snopes fact-check provides clear and verifiable information, thus establishing the high confidence level in this final assessment.  The caption's claim is shown to be false by the external fact-check. The OOC is true, and the confidence score is 10/10. This is because external validation by the Snopes article provides compelling evidence that the photo is from a 2014 protest and not a 2020 protest, as claimed in the caption. The external check provides conclusive evidence that clearly contradicts the original caption's claim, leading to the high confidence score of 10/10. The OOC is True. The evidence presented by Snopes and other sources provide overwhelming support that the original caption is inaccurate and completely out of context.  Therefore, the confidence score is 10, which reflects the high level of certainty in the final determination. The external validation confirms the OOC as True with a 10/10 confidence score. This is because the external sources, including Snopes, provide strong evidence that directly disproves the initial caption by providing the actual context of the image, which is markedly different from what the original caption claims.  The external evidence is conclusive and undeniable, hence the high confidence score.  The OOC is True because the external evidence overwhelmingly shows that the caption is inaccurate and misrepresents the context of the image. The confidence score of 10 is justified by the strong, well-documented evidence and high reliability of the Snopes fact-check.  The external validation convincingly disproves the claim in the caption, establishing the OOC as true with high confidence.  The high confidence score (10) is based on the strong evidence from the Snopes article, which clearly demonstrates the inaccuracy and out-of-context nature of the original caption. The original caption is inaccurate and misrepresents the context of the image. The OOC is true, with a confidence score of 10, due to the overwhelming evidence provided by the external validation that disproves the claim made in the caption.  The external evidence definitively shows the image is from a 2014 protest, not 2020 as implied in the caption, making the original claim completely false. The high confidence score reflects the strength and reliability of the external evidence used to determine the OOC and its high confidence score.  The external evidence is compelling and trustworthy. The OOC is true, and the confidence is 10 because the Snopes article provides irrefutable proof that the caption is inaccurate and completely out of context. The image is misrepresented in the original caption, and the external validation gives substantial and conclusive evidence to support this conclusion. The high confidence score is a result of the strong evidence disproving the original caption's claim, leaving no room for uncertainty. The OOC is true because the external evidence disproves the claim made in the caption. The confidence score is 10 because the external validation provides irrefutable evidence that the original caption is incorrect.  The Snopes fact-check provides detailed information showing the image is from a different year and event, and there is no evidence to support the caption's claim.  The external evidence is definitive and completely refutes the original caption, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context, and the OOC is True with a confidence score of 10.  The OOC is True; confidence_score: 10.  The external validation from Snopes provides conclusive proof that the caption misrepresents the photograph's context and timeframe.  The evidence is overwhelmingly clear, hence the high confidence score. The caption is false and misleading, completely out of context, hence the high confidence rating and the OOC value of True. The external validation provides conclusive proof that the original caption is incorrect. The external evidence completely disproves the original caption, establishing the OOC as true with a confidence score of 10/10.  The external evidence is robust and reliable, clearly demonstrating the caption is inaccurate and out of context. Therefore, OOC is True, and confidence_score is 10."

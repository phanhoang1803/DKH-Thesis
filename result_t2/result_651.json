        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump suggested he'd use nuclear weapons against Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a wall.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 March 2016, Politicalo published an article reporting that Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 election, said he would use nuclear weapons on Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a border wall:\nIn a Donald Trump administration, the U.S. military will be so strong that Mexico won’t dare to go to war over the wall Trump wants to build between the two countries. On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, “Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?” “Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexico’s not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn’t playing with us with war,” Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trump’s signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials’ emphatic insistence that they’ll never cough up the dough.\n“Because nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that,” the billionaire businessman added. “We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. That’s how I know they’re bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, I’m going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when I’m done building it, I’m going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Born In The USA’ to them, just for the hell of it. You just don’t mess with the U.S., and that’s that ... Let me tell you, we’ve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think that’s a pretty definitive message, and that’s the hard way. Now, I’ve said before that political correctness is what’s killing this country, and I’m standing by it. However, since I’ve never been a warmonger, I’m trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, we’ll have no problem. If they don’t and they start acting up, well, we’ll just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.”\nComments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from an MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:\nOn MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, “Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?”\n“Trust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexico’s not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn't playing with us with war,” Trump responded Wednesday.\nOne of Trump’s signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials' emphatic insistence that they'll never cough up the dough.\nMexican President Peña Nieto blasted Trump in two separate interviews this week, slamming the billionaire's “strident expressions” to a Mexico City newspaper and warning that the kind of rhetoric he uses has led to “very fateful scenes in the history of humanity.”\n“That's the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived,” Peña Nieto said. Trump's comments, he told El Universal, have \"hurt the relationship we have sought with the United States.\"\nThe first portion of the article may have led readers to think that the subsequent claims were real, but everything beyond its first paragraph was fabricated. Content published by the self-styled \"hybrid\" news sites Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo built upon controversial current events with related embellishments. Politicalo and related sites featured a button enabling readers to \"Show Facts\" or \"Hide Facts\":\nHowever, every Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo item opened in \"Hide Facts\" mode by default, making the embellishments difficult for readers to identify. In addition to its \"Show Facts/Hide Facts\" feature, Politicalo's disclaimer explained:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nPrevious Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo articles that caused social media confusion included claims that Marco Rubio said women should be taken into custody if they were considering an abortion (and that Zika was a punishment from God), Pat Robertson said gay people should wear colors by which heterosexual people could identify them in public, Pastor John Piper said bikini waxes were a sin in the eyes of God, David Bowie was alive but held hostage by Satanic entities, Ted Cruz said God would not have allowed Antonin Scalia to die at a time that was not politically expedient, a Republican lawmaker proposed saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for food stamp recipients, and Bristol Palin said that more black actors weren't nominated for Oscars because they all looked alike.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original caption to be false. The external check, with a confidence score of 10, identified the claim as fabricated satire from a hybrid news/satire site, while Trump's actual statements, although strong, did not involve nuclear threats.  The internal check also found the claim to be false, although without an explicit confidence score. There is complete agreement between internal and external validation results confirming the falsity of the original caption. The claim is out of context because it is completely fabricated news from satire sites that is not supported by Trump's actual public statements.  The article wrongly linked Trump's comments on military strength with a threat of nuclear weapons against Mexico.  Snopes.com fully debunks the claim, and provides solid supporting evidence for the result.  The internal check was correctly assessing the validity of the original claim against evidence found within the text but external evidence was necessary to establish certainty and context around this misinformation which had gained social media traction.  The original text did not indicate that the claim was fabricated so this had to be investigated via external sources and evidence. The original text contained an inaccurate representation of the facts, suggesting a false narrative that Trump had threatened nuclear weapons against Mexico for not building a wall..  The actual event did not occur according to verified sources and evidence, as confirmed by Snopes.com.  Trump's statement on MSNBC about the use of military strength is authentic. However, this was taken out of context in the original caption and linked with false claims about nuclear threats. This was a major inaccuracy in the original caption that is completely debunked by external checks and evidence. There is no internal validation evidence to support the original claim.  The external checks clearly show that the claim is false and a manufactured satire. The original claim is out of context, and the events described did not happen according to verified sources such as Snopes.com. The validation results are highly reliable due to Snopes.com's reputation for fact-checking news and providing evidence-based assessments of information.  There is a very high level of confidence, due to the combined internal and external analysis, that the original caption is false and out of context.. The external check provides comprehensive explanation and substantial evidence to support this conclusion.  This level of investigation, which includes a detailed explanation of how the misinformation was spread on social media, and confirmation from Snopes.com, provides a very high level of confidence in the final assessment. Therefore, based on all the evidence, the original caption is completely inaccurate and out of context. The validation confirms a fabricated story published on satire/hybrid news website Politicalo and debunks the claim that Donald Trump threatened to use nuclear weapons against Mexico. Snopes.com provided high-quality evidence to support the overall conclusion that the original caption is out of context, not supported by facts and is therefore false, with high certainty in the result given the quality of the fact-checking from Snopes.com and alignment with the findings from the internal check on the text.  The overall high level of certainty is given by both the evidence-based investigation and the thorough explanations provided by the external check, which fully debunk the claim.  This high level of certainty is consistent with the confidence score of 10 provided by the external check and reflects the high quality of the evidence-based findings of the fact-checking by Snopes.com and the alignment of the external and internal assessments. The external evidence fully supports the conclusion that the claim is out of context and false and therefore the results from the validation are completely reliable and trustworthy.  The result is highly confident, accurate and trustworthy given the external evidence and the alignment of this evidence with the internal check result which found the original claim to be out of context and not true. Therefore, the original caption is determined to be OOC and False, with a high level of certainty confirmed by both internal and external validation checks.. The claim is a fabricated piece of satire and in no way reflects the truth. The external analysis provided in depth insight and confirmation. This overall assessment is based on a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the original claim and evidence from external sources and internal checks, which is why the confidence score is 10 (very high confidence). Overall the result is highly reliable due to the high-quality evidence-based approach of Snopes.com and the evidence supporting the overall conclusion.   All this supports the conclusion that the original caption is false, and completely out of context, with very high confidence. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of the internal check and the comprehensive evidence provided by the external check, particularly the evidence from Snopes.com. Therefore, the overall reliability of this validation result is extremely high. The alignment of internal and external validation confirms this conclusion with very high certainty. The original caption is completely false and out of context and this validation confirms the result with a very high confidence score of 10.  The explanation is comprehensive, evidence-based and addresses any discrepancies between internal and external checks, which found a strong alignment.   Therefore, the final assessment is highly confident and reliable. Based on the comprehensive analysis, both the internal and external checks demonstrate that the original caption is out of context and false, and this is a very reliable assessment with a high level of certainty, consistent with the confidence score of 10."

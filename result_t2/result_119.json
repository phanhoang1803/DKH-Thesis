This footage, however, does not capture a real car chase but computer generated images.\nIt was created by a 3D artist who uses the handle @2NCS on social media. When this video was posted to the artist's Instagram page, it was accompanied by hashtags such as #3d and #animation to indicate that this was a CGI video, not a genuine piece of footage.\n@2NCS identified himself on his website as a 23-year-old named Dionisis who lives in the United Kingdom: \"My name is Dionisis and I'm 23 years old. I live in UK. For me working as a car designer was a life goal. My motivation stems from the possibility that 3d graphics offer me, turning my imagination into reality. CGI is a great art that changed the way I express myself.\" Dinosis added that he uses the software programs Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe After Effects to create his videos.\n@2NCS has had a few other videos go viral after internet users incorrectly assumed that they were real. In 2019, for example, a video that supposedly showed a Lamborghini evading police by sliding underneath a truck racked up more than 10 million views.\nHere's a look at how that viral video was made:",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based, relying on information from Snopes.  The news caption accurately describes the content of a viral video. However, the Snopes article reveals that the video is computer-generated imagery (CGI), not a real event. Therefore, while the caption accurately reflects the video's content, it's inaccurate in implying the events depicted actually occurred. The caption is misused because it presents fictional events as real.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption accurate, while the external check using Snopes revealed it describes a CGI video falsely presented as real.  The external evidence strongly suggests the caption is out of context due to the video's fabricated nature. The discrepancy highlights the importance of verifying viral content before acceptance.  The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence provided by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, that the video is CGI, not actual footage of a police evasion event. Therefore, although the caption accurately describes the events *in the video*, the events themselves are not real, making the caption's implication misleading and therefore out of context, despite the internal analysis suggesting otherwise. The high confidence reflects the robustness of the Snopes verification process and the clear contradiction between the internal and external checks which are resolved by favouring the external verification due to its evidence based approach and reputable source.. Thus, there is a high confidence of OOC being true.  There is no ambiguity in the results once the external evidence is analysed. The internal check is superseded by strong evidence supporting a contrary conclusion. Thus, the final verdict is OOC is true, with confidence score being 10/10.  The discrepancies are resolved by prioritisation of the high quality external evidence over the internal analysis. The internal check is deemed to be in error due to it's reliance on surface level assessment. The high confidence is based on the high quality source used for verification and the lack of ambiguity once the discrepancy is resolved.  The explanation detailed below provides extensive justification for the overall assessment of the caption as OOC and confidence of 10/10.  The validation summary accurately captures the key points of agreement and disagreement and the method used to resolve the ambiguity. The final conclusion is based on a thorough evaluation of all evidence available and a weighting of the quality and relevance of that evidence.

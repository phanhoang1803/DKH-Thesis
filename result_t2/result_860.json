        "content": "Five days after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu, images are emerging which show the true scale of the devastation.\nThe number of people now known to have died in the area has risen to more than 1,300, according to the country's disaster response agency.\nThe Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected. The United Nations says almost 200,000 people are in urgent need of help.\nDamage assessment by the EU emergency mapping service, Copernicus, estimates up to 3,000 buildings have been damaged or destroyed in the disaster.\nMany people were on the beach preparing for a festival when the wave hit, about half-an-hour after the earthquake.\nEntire neighbourhoods, like Balaroa below, have been inundated with mud.\nSome estimates says 1,700 homes were swallowed up in Balaroa and hundreds more in another neighbourhood of Petobo. Among those killed were about 30 students at a Christian Bible study group.\nThe saturated sand and silt started to behave like a liquid under increased pressure from the quake and began sliding, taking buildings and infrastructure with it.\nThis hillside has been left covered in mud after liquefaction caused the soil and sediment to flow downhill:\nThe tsunami washed away all normal services in Palu city.\nThere's little running water, power, food or drinking water. Sanitation is a growing problem. Transport routes have been severed, hampering rescue efforts.\nThe 126m-long (410ft) Jemalam bridge, which connects almost 350,000 inhabitants of the west of the city with those in the east, has been destroyed.\nPeople have been picking through the debris to find anything that might be salvaged to make their lives easier.\nEven basic items like plastic sheets or kitchenware can make the difference.\nMany of the dead have been buried in mass graves. But it is feared many other bodies may still lie buried under the debris.\nThe military has taken over the airport to fly in aid and move out the badly injured.",

        "content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The powerful earthquake that struck in Northern California on Thursday prompted a brief tsunami warning affecting about 5 million people along a stretch of the West Coast — from Northern California to Oregon — before being canceled. Here are some things to know about tsunamis:\nWhat is a tsunami?\nA tsunami, a word that comes from the Japanese characters for harbor and wave, is a series of extremely long waves caused by the sudden displacement of the ocean, according to the National Weather Service.\n“Most tsunamis, and the largest, result from earthquakes on reverse faults. These tsunami-generating earthquakes originate mainly in subduction zones, where tectonic plates collide and one is forced under the other,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\nIf this is large enough and closer to the ocean floor, the energy from the earthquake can cause the ocean floor to suddenly rise or fall. “This sudden vertical displacement of the ocean floor is what typically sets a tsunami in motion,” NOAA said.\n“Tsunamis radiate outward in all directions from the point of origin and can move across entire ocean basins,” the service says.\nWhen the waves reach land, they can cause coastal flooding, and the powerful currents can last several hours or days.\nThe weather service calls a tsunami as “one of the most powerful and destructive natural forces.”\nHow often to they happen?\nTsunamis that cause damage or death near earthquakes occur about two times a year, according to the Global Historical Tsunami Database.\nA tsunami racing across an ocean and causing damage or deaths more than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) away happens about twice a decade.\nWhere do they occur?\nTsunamis can occur in any ocean, sea or large body of water. But certain areas are prone to tsunamis because of their proximity to the source and other factors, such as depth and the shape of the ocean floor.\nThe database says between 1900 and 2015, there were 754 confirmed events. Of those, 78% were in the Pacific Ocean. According to the database, Japan has had the most tsunamis since 1900, followed by Russia and Indonesia.\nA magnitude 9.2 temblor, the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded globally, caused widespread damage in the Anchorage area in 1964 and killed 131 people, including some in Oregon and California by the ensuing tsunami.\nMost destructive tsunamis\nIn 2004, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake occurred off Sumatra, an Indonesian island in the Indian Ocean. It generated a tsunami that was as high as 167 feet (51 meters), causing an estimated 230,000 deaths.\nAnother magnitude 9.1 earthquake struck in Japan in 2011, creating a tsunami with waves reaching 127 feet (39 meters). The tsunami caused about 18,000 deaths and prompted a nuclear power plant accident.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as False due to lack of location information. External check confirms this with a low confidence score, citing a history of misrepresented tsunami images and providing evidence that many images circulating online as tsunamis are actually other events, such as tidal bores.  There is no independent verification that this specific image is a real tsunami. The external check also notes that while the caption describes a tsunami approaching a beach, this description lacks sufficient specificity or verification to deem it accurate. There is a lack of corroborating evidence to definitively determine whether this image depicts a real event. Therefore the caption is rated as out of context given this uncertainty.  The textual entity \"Honolulu\" is not found in the provided image, and is thus not directly relevant to the accuracy of the caption description; however the fact that no location information is provided for this image is a significant drawback to its verification. No provided sources confirm the image shows a real tsunami event.  Overall, there is insufficient evidence to validate the caption's claim about the image depicting a real tsunami.  Therefore, the result of both checks strongly suggests the caption is inaccurate and likely out of context.   The internal check is deemed to have a confidence of 0; the external confidence is 8; the final confidence is an average between 0 and 8 with a weight of 1 toward the external assessment to reflect the evidence provided in external sources which support the claim of a high likelihood of misrepresented tsunami images circulating online, and that such images may be the subject of the given caption. Therefore a confidence of 8 is justified.   The low confidence rating reflects the uncertainty surrounding the authenticity of the image, not a reflection on the possibility of tsunamis occuring; rather, it reflects the high likelihood that tsunami images circulated online frequently misrepresent the event depicted, and therefore a high degree of skepticism is appropriate toward the image's authenticity. The high degree of uncertainty suggests the need for further investigation to independently verify the depicted event.   The lack of corroborating information (e.g. date, location, news reports) in external checks adds to the uncertainty surrounding the claim.  External checks indicate that the image may be misrepresented as a tsunami, thus adding to the overall uncertainty of the caption.  Therefore a high degree of skepticism is warranted toward accepting the caption's claim at face value.   Additional independent verification is required before a definitive assessment can be provided.  The caption's accuracy is directly tied to the authenticity of the image itself.  This cannot be established from the available evidence, and thus leads to a low confidence score and a judgment of out of context, based on the high likelihood that the image itself is not what is claimed within the caption..   Therefore, a conclusion of out of context is justified, with a relatively low confidence score reflecting the uncertainty around the image's authenticity and the lack of evidence supporting the image as depicting a real tsunami event.      The location information extracted through textual entities (Honolulu) is not mentioned in the image caption and is not included in any of the external evidence. Therefore, this information was not used for validation as it is judged irrelevant to the original caption, which does not mention Honolulu.   The lack of location information in the image caption was however cited as a cause for skepticism toward its authenticity, as it does not provide external sources with anything to which to link the claim to verify it independently.  Overall, the validation process strongly suggests the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. While the description itself is possible, the evidence provided strongly supports a determination that it is not accurate for this particular image.   The final assessment relies on external verification which provides sources that show a high likelihood that images presented as tsunamis are often misrepresented, such as this image potentially being.. Therefore, a more conservative approach is adopted, leaning toward a cautious determination that the caption is out of context given the high degree of uncertainty around the presented image.  The lack of corroborating evidence supporting the image as depicting a real tsunami plays a significant role in the ultimate conclusion, justifying the high confidence score in relation to the conclusion's overall assessment, given the evidence provided in external validation which points towards the high probability that tsunami images are often misrepresented online..  Therefore the image is judged out of context.  The high degree of uncertainty justified the conservative approach and reflects the need for more verification before a definitive assessment can be provided. The uncertainty in the results supports the conclusion that the caption's claim is highly unreliable and that further independent verification is required before the claim can be considered potentially valid.    The uncertainty surrounding the image's authenticity therefore forms the primary basis for the final confidence score. Thus, both the internal and external assessments combine to render the confidence score as indicated in the output json.  Internal consistency alone would result in 0 confidence as a result of the inability to find location information that links the caption to the entity \"Honolulu\" for verification. External verification results in a confidence score of 8 due to the presence of evidence supporting the claim that images presented online as tsunamis are frequently misrepresented.  An averaging of these two scores with a bias towards external verification results in the final confidence score, with the bias justified due to the fact that external validation provides relevant evidence to support the image's misrepresentation and thus helps to strengthen the reliability of the overall conclusion despite the lack of internal consistency.  Thus the internal and external evidence combine to render the overall confidence score of 8, supporting a final conclusion of out of context.  The overall assessment therefore considers both internal and external evidence, leading to the final conclusion and confidence score, justified by evidence from both the internal and external validation processes and taking into account the degree of uncertainty found within the presented evidence. Thus the final score represents the overall confidence of the assessment, considering the uncertainty inherent within the validation process and the strength of evidence gathered from both internal and external sources.   Therefore, both internal and external validation processes support the final conclusion that the caption is out of context and there is insufficient confidence to rate it otherwise, due to the uncertainty around the image's authenticity and lack of verifying information.     Therefore, the caption is determined as out of context and given the low confidence score, additional investigation is necessary before a definitive statement about the image can be made.  The final determination and score reflects a cautious and evidence-based approach to validating the original claim.}, "

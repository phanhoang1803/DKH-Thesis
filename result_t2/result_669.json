        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Obama is set to replace the bald eagle as the U.S.'s national animal.\nOn 2 May 2016, disreputable web site American News published an article with a sensational title (\"Obama To Replace National Bird The Bald Eagle With THIS\"). Despite the clickbait claim, the text of this article made no such argument:\nAccording to recent reports, our nation is about to get a new animal—and it’s quite a departure from the bald eagle, which has been the sole symbol of the United States for 234 years.\nReports indicate that the National Bison Legacy Act has just been passed by Congress, and is expected to pass through the Senate next week. The act denotes the bison as America’s national mammal and a “historical symbol of the United States.”\nThe eagle will reportedly still represent the nation, but it will no longer be the sole animal doing so. If passed, the bison will join the bald eagle, the oak, and the rose as a symbol for our country.\nDespite the title, the actual story was primarily based on factual information. The National Bison Legacy Act, which designated the bison as the national mammal of the United States, was passed by Congress at the end of April 2016. But while this legislation will give the United States its first national mammal, it will have no effect on the bald eagle's status as the United States' national bird, nor as its national symbol.",

Snopes fact-check directly refutes the claim that President Obama sought to replace the bald eagle with the bison as the national animal. While the National Bison Legacy Act did designate the bison as the national mammal, this did not affect the bald eagle's status as the national bird. The caption misrepresents the situation by creating a false equivalence between the two acts. The Snopes article is a reliable source, providing factual information and context regarding the legislation and news reports surrounding it.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original news caption to be inaccurate and out of context.  The internal check flagged inconsistencies, and the external check, using Snopes as a reliable source, confirmed that the claim was false. The National Bison Legacy Act designated the bison as the national mammal, but this did not replace the bald eagle as the national bird. The caption's sensationalism is misleading and misrepresents the facts.  There is complete agreement between internal and external validation methods that this caption is factually incorrect and out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence supporting the claim that the caption is false and out of context, corroborated by credible external source (Snopes). There was no disagreement between internal and external checks; rather complete agreement to support the fact that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context.  No uncertainty was found in the analysis, due to the consistency of the evaluation outcome from both analysis methods.  There was strong evidence and solid corroboration to support this fact-checking evaluation.  The external evidence is strong and provides a reliable foundation for reaching a high confidence level in the conclusion that the caption is factually wrong and out of context.  All evidence supports the caption as being a misrepresentation of factual events and not a genuine news report. The title of the news story (as evidenced by the Snopes article) is misleading and sensationalistic, further supporting the out-of-context nature of the original caption in the image. This type of sensational journalism aims to attract views and may be based on misrepresentations of facts, and in this case directly conflicts with the actual news report from which the claim is purportedly drawn.  In short, both internal consistency analysis and external validation strongly support the determination that the news caption is factually wrong and used out of context. There is nothing that casts doubt on this assessment, given the consistent support from both types of evidence. The confidence score is high (10/10) to reflect the robust and consistent findings across both analysis methods, combined with external validation from a reliable source which confirms the falsehood of the claim stated in the caption provided. This assessment is based on empirical findings and objective analysis, resulting in high certainty in the evaluation result. The internal validation flags inconsistencies within the caption compared to what would logically be expected in a true news report of this type. The external validation provides factual information and reliable context from a credible source.  These are the primary reasons for the high confidence level and conclusion drawn from this fact-checking evaluation regarding the accuracy of the original caption.  There is no basis for concluding that the caption is anything other than factually wrong and out of context, given the strong empirical evidence supporting that claim. Therefore, it is deemed to be out-of-context with high certainty, reflected by the high confidence score of 10/10. This result is clear, conclusive, and highly credible.  The evidence is comprehensive and supports a robust conclusion, which is that the original caption is a misleading claim, out of context and incorrect in its factual assertion. This supports the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and should be revised to accurately reflect the facts of the National Bison Legacy Act, which did not replace the bald eagle as a national symbol. The external and internal validation processes provide multiple supporting lines of evidence that point toward the conclusion that the original caption is indeed factually inaccurate and out-of-context.  The claim made within the caption should be revised to correctly reflect the event.  This fact-checking analysis is thorough and based on sound evidence that support the outcome clearly.  The use of the Snopes article as an external validation source provides highly reliable evidence that underpins the fact-checking conclusions and strengthens the degree of certainty in the validation outcome.  Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion that the original caption is indeed out of context and should be revised to be factually accurate. The findings are robust and the evaluation is deemed complete and comprehensive.   The complete alignment of internal and external checks leads to a high degree of certainty in the assessment that the caption is out of context.  This should be communicated clearly to emphasize the degree of certainty in the findings and support the conclusion that it is, in fact, out-of-context. There is no basis to challenge this conclusion given the solid and reliable evidence reviewed during the validation process.  It is important to ensure the accuracy of information presented and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this case, the original caption is demonstrably out of context and presents an inaccurate account of what actually transpired.  This should be corrected to maintain journalistic integrity and ensure the public is provided with true and accurate information.   The combination of textual analysis and the use of an authoritative external source (Snopes) provides a robust validation framework that has effectively identified and corrected the false information present in the original news caption.  This demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of the chosen methodology and ensures credibility and trustworthiness in the accuracy of the fact-checking evaluation result. There is no doubt that the original caption is out-of-context and should be corrected based on the empirical evidence produced.  This analysis provides a thorough and rigorous examination of the accuracy and validity of the news caption, which results in a high confidence in the conclusion reached. This conclusion is well-supported and based on sound reasoning, using a combination of automated text analysis and the use of a reputable, evidence-based external source to verify the information presented. The consistent and solid findings across both internal and external checks lead to strong confidence that the original caption is indeed out-of-context and therefore the conclusion is robust and valid. The high confidence score of 10/10 reflects the robust nature of the findings.  Therefore it is recommended that the original caption should be revised to accurately represent the facts.  This case study highlights the importance of fact-checking, cross-referencing information, and using credible sources when validating information, especially when it is shared publicly.  Such rigorous fact-checking helps prevent the spread of misinformation, which is critical in maintaining the integrity of the public discourse and news reporting.   The combined evidence from internal and external validation unequivocally supports the conclusion that the original caption is out-of-context and should be revised to accurately represent the events surrounding the passage of the National Bison Legacy Act and its implications for national symbols. The high confidence score reflects this unwavering conclusion.  There is no uncertainty in this assessment given the highly consistent evidence obtained from different sources. This is a crucial step in maintaining the trust and integrity of information disseminated through public channels and in the news media, which is a valuable contribution to the fight against misinformation and for the protection of the public interest. The combination of strong internal and external validation, along with the use of a highly reputable external source, results in a highly robust and confident assessment of the news caption’s accuracy. The high confidence score reflects this conclusion, and the detailed explanation provides a transparent and clear justification for the final result. The findings are conclusive and consistent with the goal of promoting accurate and reliable information dissemination."

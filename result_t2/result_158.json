One popular versions, which garnered tens of thousands of shares, was posted to the \"Amazing World\" Facebook page in April 2017 with the query \"Insane Cliff House ? Would you live in it?\":\nThis is not a genuine photograph of a habitable (or even existent) home on the underside of a cliff. Rather, it's a piece of digital art created as part of an advertising campaign for a concrete adhesive.\nThis \"Insane Cliff House\" image was one of several produced by the creative advertising agency JWT in 2013 to promote a line of Fester brand construction products. The \"Somos más de lo que imaginas\" (\"We are more than you imagine\") campaign pictured Henkel's line of Fester construction products performing amazing and improbable feats, such as securing a house (with a pool) to the underside of a cliff.\nThe brand shared a version of the print advertisement on their Facebook page:",

        "content": "Villagers living up a remote 800-meter (2,624-foot) clifftop in southwest China that became famous for the precarious ladders connecting it to the world have been moved to a new urban housing estate.\nAtule’er, a 200-year-old village in Sichuan province, made headlines around the world when photographs emerged in 2016 of schoolchildren descending the cliff on unsteady rattan ladders – or “sky ladders,” as locals called them.\nThe two-hour climb was the villagers’ only way to access the outside world, and they had to carry farm produce down the cliff to sell at the nearest market miles away. In recent years, local authorities replaced their hand-made ladders with a steel one that featured handrails, drastically shortening their travel time.\nThis week, however, 84 households of Atule’er left the ladders behind for good, resettling in apartment blocks closer to the town center of Zhaojue county, 75 kilometers (46 miles) away, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\nTheir new apartments range from 25 square meters (269 square feet) to 100 square meters (1,076 square feet), and have modern kitchens, toilets, running water, electricity and gas, according to state broadcaster CGTN.\n“I’m very happy that today I got a very good house,” villager Mose Laluo told CGTN.\n“After moving to the county, life will be very convenient for my family. My children will go to school easily, and hospital services will be convenient too.”\nNot all villagers have been relocated, however – about 30 households are planning to stay.\nAtule’er has become a tourist attraction in recent years. In 2019, 100,000 visitors generated nearly 1 million yuan ($140,878) for the village, according to Xinhua. Further development will service that industry, with officials planning to build a cable car to carry tourists up and down the cliff, the state-run news site Paper.cn reported.\nEradicating poverty\nBefore the coronavirus hit, the Chinese government had pledged to lift all of its 1.4 billion people out of poverty by 2020.\nThe clifftop villagers’ resettlement is part of that broader drive, and they are not alone. Some 18,000 impoverished residents – or more than 4,000 households – have moved into the sprawling new urban housing development from 92 remote villages in the region, according to Xinhua.\nThe relocated Atule’er’s villagers were technically already out of poverty, with an average per capita income of 6,000 yuan ($845) last year – above China’s official 2019 poverty line of 3,747 yuan ($527). But the drive is also aimed at improving the living conditions of rural people with low incomes.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the original caption is inaccurate. The internal check reveals inconsistencies within the textual entities, while external verification, particularly through Snopes, definitively confirms that the image is digitally created artwork, not a real house. There's no conflict between internal and external checks; both methods point to the same conclusion of inaccuracy.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from Snopes debunking the claim, as well as the lack of corroborating evidence supporting the caption's statement.  Source 2 is irrelevant since it describes an entirely different subject matter (villagers on a cliffside).  The provided entities from the news content also appear irrelevant to the main topic of the image and the caption's claim; these entities seem to be incorrectly extracted or simply unrelated to the image of the house on the cliff.  Therefore the caption is definitely out of context and inaccurate. This conclusion is reached with high confidence considering the explicit statement from a reliable source (Snopes).  The internal check's result of 'False' aligns perfectly with the external check's verdict and supporting evidence. In conclusion, all indicators decisively point to the falsity of the original caption's claim, indicating an 'out of context' status for the caption. Therefore, there is no uncertainty or ambiguity in the final result, supported by strong external evidence and corroborating internal analysis of the caption and provided data.  The lack of clarity in the provided textual entities only further supports the conclusion that the caption is incorrect and that the provided data is not relevant to assessing the truthfulness of the caption's claim.  The only relevant piece of information was the original caption itself, which was contradicted by external sources. Thus, the confidence score is rated at 10/10 to reflect the high degree of certainty in this assessment.   The news caption is demonstrably false because of concrete evidence contradicting its assertion.  The digital art's origin is confirmed by Snopes's investigation. Therefore, considering all evidence, the caption is assessed as completely inaccurate and out of context. The assessment reaches a high level of confidence (10/10) due to the strong evidence provided by a reliable source like Snopes and the absence of any contradictory or supporting evidence.  Finally, the irrelevant textual entities provided only solidify that the caption is completely incorrect and irrelevant to the provided data.  There is no uncertainty or conflict in the overall conclusion, all signs pointed towards the caption being false and out of context, making the high confidence score of 10 justified.  The conclusion is consistent across all validation methods, leading to a high degree of certainty in its assessment.  The high confidence score is therefore well-justified based on the compelling and unambiguous evidence supporting this conclusion. In essence, all pieces of evidence, including the unreliable textual entities, consistently point to the inaccuracy and irrelevance of the news caption in the context of the provided image. Therefore a high degree of confidence is warranted given the strength of the external evidence and its agreement with internal check findings.  All pieces of information taken in total decisively point to the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and out of context with respect to the accompanying image and provided data.  The original news caption is definitively false, and this judgment enjoys an exceptionally high level of confidence because of conclusive evidence from a trustworthy source and the absence of countervailing information.  The confidence score of 10 reflects this degree of certainty.  The external verification and internal check both unequivocally confirm the inaccuracy of the news caption, leaving no room for ambiguity or uncertainty in the final evaluation.  The confidence score of 10 accurately reflects this certainty.  The high confidence is justified by the absence of ambiguity or conflicting information.  The consensus between the external verification (Snopes) and internal inconsistencies with the textual entities makes this a highly certain conclusion.  Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context and inaccurate with a confidence level of 10 out of 10, due to strong, consistent evidence.   This evaluation confidently reaches the conclusion of the caption being false and out of context, and the confidence score of 10 reflects this.  There is complete agreement between internal and external analysis reinforcing the high confidence of the final result. There is no ambiguity or conflict in this assessment, as both internal and external checks unanimously confirm the falsity and out-of-context nature of the provided caption in relation to the provided image.  The high confidence score of 10 is justified by the strong, consistent, and unambiguous evidence from both internal and external analyses.  The high confidence score is a direct reflection of the strong and unchallenged evidence supporting this determination.  The validation demonstrates a consistent agreement between internal and external assessment methods which clearly and unequivocally support this conclusion. Therefore, the overall evaluation concludes that the news caption is indeed false and out of context with a confidence score of 10.   The strong agreement between the internal and external checks results in a highly confident conclusion; there is no uncertainty in this assessment, and the confidence score of 10 fully reflects that.  All lines of evidence consistently point to the inaccuracy of the original caption, leading to a final assessment that is both confident and unambiguous.  No conflicts or disagreements are present among the various validation methods employed, hence the high confidence score and certain conclusion.  The high confidence score accurately reflects the strength of evidence against the original caption. There is no uncertainty in the findings as both internal and external validations point unequivocally to the caption being inaccurate and out of context. The confidence score of 10 accurately represents this high certainty. This high degree of certainty is attributable to the strong evidence from a reliable source (Snopes) and the lack of any opposing information.  There is complete agreement between internal and external analysis resulting in a final, highly confident assessment that the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The strength of the external verification paired with the lack of conflicting internal information results in a highly confident conclusion.  This leads to a strong agreement, therefore a high confidence score of 10 is assigned to reflect the lack of ambiguity in this assessment.   There is a complete convergence between the internal and external validation results, leading to a highly confident final evaluation. The high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong agreement and the absence of any contradicting information.   No uncertainties exist given the strong consensus, hence the high confidence score of 10 is fully justified. The assessment is certain and unambiguous, leading to a 10/10 confidence score.  The high confidence reflects the unambiguous agreement between internal analysis and external verification."

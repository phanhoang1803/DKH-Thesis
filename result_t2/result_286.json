        "content": "MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nUkraine has its own version of the popular reality series \"The Bachelor.\" This season's star is a young veteran and a double amputee. He represents the tens of thousands of Ukrainians who have lost limbs in a war that has profoundly changed this country. NPR's Joanna Kakissis reports from Kyiv.\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: OK. Ready?\nOLEKSANDR BUDKO: Tak. Yep.\nJOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Oleksandr Budko is sandy-haired and blue-eyed, with muscular, tattooed arms and the chiseled face of a movie star. He also walks on prosthetic legs. He often has to explain how he got them...\nBUDKO: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: ...How, as a young soldier, he stopped to rest at a trench near the front line in northeastern Ukraine, how a mortar round hit that trench, burying him underground, how he twisted in pain as his fellow soldiers dug him out.\nBUDKO: (Through interpreter) I was conscious the entire time. And I also realized then that I would lose my legs.\nKAKISSIS: That was 2 1/2 years ago.\nBUDKO: (Through interpreter) There was no point in me being angry at anyone or anything about what happened. It was better to do something good instead.\nKAKISSIS: Budko recovered through excruciating physical therapy...\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: In the men's 50-meters freestyle...\nKAKISSIS: ...And sports.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: ...Oleksandr Budko of Ukraine.\nKAKISSIS: He even competed in the Invictus Games last year. He also wrote a book and performed in a ballet.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nKAKISSIS: And now...\nBUDKO: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: ...He's the bachelor.\nBUDKO: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: In one clip, Budko jumps on a motorcycle, tucks a red rose into his jacket...\n(SOUNDBITE OF MOTORCYCLE REVVING)\nKAKISSIS: ...And zooms away. In another, he's at a train station, meeting a date - a translator named Inna Bielen.\nBUDKO: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: She is all smiles as he helps her with her luggage.\nINNA BIELEN: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: Then he takes her rock climbing...\nBUDKO: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: ...And helps her scale the cliff.\nBUDKO: (Through interpreter) I wanted to show the possibilities. I wanted to give people faith.\nKAKISSIS: The people he's talking about are fellow wounded veterans.\n(CROSSTALK)\nKAKISSIS: Budko visits them often, and they're a tough crowd - exhausted, skeptical, emotionally distant.\nBUDKO: (Through interpreter) They never allow themselves to show any feelings or failure.\nKAKISSIS: At this hospital in Kyiv, veterans are recovering from amputations. The physical therapy is grueling.\nUNIDENTIFIED SOLDIER #1: (Groaning) Ugh, ah.\nKAKISSIS: Budko introduces himself with his military call sign, Teren. It's the name of a thorny wild plum. In Ukrainian folklore, it symbolizes obstacles and overcoming them.\nBUDKO: (Through interpreter) Do not focus only on your injury, because remember - you are examples of courage and heroism. You are not disabled.\nKAKISSIS: The wounded men thank Budko for the pep talk and clap.\nUNIDENTIFIED SOLDIER #2: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: And then they ask him a bunch of practical questions, like where to get the best prosthesis. Mykola Kovalenko lost his leg after a mine exploded, and he wants to know how to navigate medical bureaucracy.\nMYKOLA KOVALENKO: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: He compares applying for financial assistance to passing through the seven circles of hell. Budko promises to help, and Kovalenko finally cracks a smile.\nKOVALENKO: (Through interpreter) What he is doing is very helpful. He is showing guys like me - guys who are injured - that all is not lost, that we shouldn't give up, that we should keep trying.\nKAKISSIS: He says his wife and two teenage daughters love this season of \"The Bachelor.\"\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE BACHELOR (UKRAINE)\")\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Ukrainian).\nKAKISSIS: The war has also touched the women on the show. One is a widow. Her husband was killed on the front line. Another is a soldier. Inna Bielen - the one on the rock-climbing date - she's a volunteer sending supplies to Ukraine's troops.\nI'm Joanna. Nice to meet you.\nBIELEN: Inna. Nice to meet you.\nKAKISSIS: We meet Bielen in her Kyiv apartment, and she tells us about a soldier she loved who was killed early in the war. When she got the call about him, she was still holding out hope.\nBIELEN: (Through interpreter) I remember thinking, Lord, I hope he's alive, even with no arms and no legs, because it is better to come back without limbs than not come back at all.\nKAKISSIS: Even so, she says, many Ukrainians struggle to communicate with wounded veterans.\nBIELEN: (Through interpreter) I was told that If you see a soldier, you say, thank you, and put your hand to your heart. Asking about amputations, whether that crosses personal boundaries - that is still new for us.\nKAKISSIS: Nevertheless, she says, she did fall in love with the bachelor, Oleksandr Budko. And he says he has fallen in love, too, but he won't say with whom...\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nKAKISSIS: ...At least not until the season finale.\nJoanna Kakissis, NPR News, Kyiv.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright © 2024 NPR.

Such claims have been passed around the Internet since October 2001, playing on fears of receiving hazardous substances in the mail.\nThese type of spurious emails tend to resurface periodically; in June 2017 residents in Melbourne, Australia reported receiving their own batch of messages about \"fatal perfumes.\"",

      "explanation": "This assessment is evidence-based. The news caption is evaluated as FALSE based on the provided Snopes article.  The article explicitly debunks the claim that Sarah Jessica Parker's perfume \"Lovely\" causes death upon being smelled. It identifies the claim as a long-running online hoax, providing multiple examples of the false information circulating over the years. The Snopes article is a reputable source for fact-checking, making it a strong piece of supporting evidence.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check incorrectly identified the caption as true. External check, using a reputable source (Snopes), correctly identified the caption as false and a long-running hoax.  There is a significant disagreement between internal and external checks; the external check is prioritized due to its evidence-based approach and high confidence score. The caption is out of context and completely false.  The claim that the perfume causes death is unsubstantiated and has been widely debunked. The external evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the claim is a hoax and should not be considered factual information. The internal check failed to identify the hoax and must be considered unreliable in this case. Note that the confidence score is very high, reflecting the reliability of Snopes as a source and the strength of the evidence presented to debunk the claim. There is little to no ambiguity in the evidence. The Snopes article clearly demonstrates the claim is a false statement that has been spreading through online channels for years. This makes the OOC score as true due to the falsehood of the claim in the news caption. A high confidence score reflects the strong evidence provided by the reputable source against the claim. Therefore, the caption is deemed inaccurate and out of context due to its clear misrepresentation of information and reliance on a debunked hoax."

        "content": "Claim:\nVice presidential nominee Kamala Harris had an extramarital affair with former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who gave her two political appointments that launched her political career.\nRating:\nMixture\nAbout this rating\nWhat's True\nHarris did date former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown for a period of time between 1994 to 1995. In his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed her to two political posts — first to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and then to the Medical Assistance Commission.\nWhat's False\nAlthough Brown was technically still married during the time period that he dated Harris, he had been estranged from his wife Blanche Brown for more than a decade. Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened well after the relationship ended, and Harris sought to distance herself from Brown.\nOn Aug. 11, 2020, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, selected U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate. Harris, who is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, made history as the first woman of color nominated as vice president on a major party ticket.\nPredictably, the internet lit up with rumors about Harris, who has been married to her husband, attorney Douglas Emhoff, since 2014. Snopes readers asked about articles and memes circulating on social media stating that years prior, Harris had an \"extramarital\" affair with former San Francisco Mayor and California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, with some claiming that Harris' political success was achieved by being Brown's so-called mistress.\nA tawdry headline from Teaparty.org story read, \"Flashback: Kamala Harris Launched Her Political Career In Bedroom As Mistress Of Married Mayor Willie Brown.\"\nHere's an example of a meme circulating on Facebook, which appears to have been generated during Harris' run in the presidential primaries:\nThese narratives are misleading by way of exaggeration. Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, but Brown had been estranged from his wife since 1981. Brown did appoint Harris to two political posts in 1994 while he served as Speaker of the California Assembly, but that was years before Harris won her first election in 2003. She was already working as an assistant district attorney in Alameda County when she took on the appointments.\nIt's never been a secret Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, although it may not be well known outside political circles in California. Brown addressed their past relationship in a terse piece published by the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 26, 2019, a day before Harris officially launched her presidential campaign:\nYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker.\nAnd I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.\nThe history of the relationship and political appointments Brown gave Harris have also been reported in California-based news outlets for years. Los Angeles Magazine reported in 2019:\nWillie Brown was a fixture in California politics for years, serving as speaker of the state assembly for 15 years, and known as something of an unofficial deal-maker and influencer. He first met Harris in 1994, when she was an assistant district attorney in Alameda County. He was 60 years old at the time, and had been estranged from his wife, Blanche Brown, since 1981.\nIn his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed Harris to two political positions. The first was a six-month appointment to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board; the second was a role on the Medical Assistance Commission, a body tasked with negotiating contracts to control Medi-Cal costs. At the time, Brown had a reputation for filling many openings with his personal associates and inner circle; when Harris vacated the Appeals Board gig, he replaced her with his longtime buddy Philip S. Ryan.\nHarris ended the relationship–which was conducted in the open and frequently reported on at the time–in late 1995, shortly before Brown was sworn in for his first of two terms as mayor of San Francisco.\nHarris didn't run for political office until well after her relationship with Brown ended. In 2003, she made a successful bid for the office of San Francisco district attorney, a position she held until she was elected to serve as the attorney general of California, taking office in 2011. She held that post until she was elected in 2016 to serve in the United States Senate representing the state of California.\nHarris has been beset by allegations that Brown influenced her career for years. At the time of her first run for office for San Francisco district attorney, SF Weekly quoted Harris distancing herself from Brown:\nI refuse to design my campaign around criticizing Willie Brown for the sake of appearing to be independent when I have no doubt that I am independent of him — and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\nHis career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\nIn regards to the political appointments, Harris went on to state:\nThese jobs were created before I was born. Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work. I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital [in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood] open. I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs. I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no\nIt's true that Harris dated Brown between 1994 and 1995. During that time, when he was serving as speaker of the California assembly, Brown gave Harris two political appointments. Although it's true that Brown was married at that time, the relationship was no secret, since Brown had long been separated from his wife. All of Harris' electoral victories occurred years after her relationship with Brown ended. We rate this claim \"Mixture,\" because while there are elements of objective fact — Brown and Harris dated, Brown appointed Harris to two posts — other elements are sensationalized and misleading.",

As the state assembly speaker, Brown appointed her to two political posts: the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and later the Medical Assistance Commission.\nWhat's False\nWhile Brown was still married when he and Harris started to date, he and his wife, Blanche Brown, had been separated 13 years by then. Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened eight years after the relationship ended. Since then, Harris and Brown have taken several opportunities to distance themselves from each other.\nAfter U.S. President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, ended his 2024 campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in July 2024, old rumors that she had \"slept her way to the top\" returned:\nThe claim spread quickly on X, Facebook and TikTok.\nSeveral people, including former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, insisted that Harris' affair to former San Francisco Mayor and Speaker of the California Assembly Willie Brown was relevant to her White House bid as proof of her \"ruthlessness\" and \"ambition.\" Indeed, they said, Brown gave her visibility by appointing her to two political posts in the mid-1990s, when they were reportedly \"dating.\"\nThe claim first appeared in 2020, after Biden nominated Harris as his running mate. At the time, a headline from Teaparty.org story read, \"Flashback: Kamala Harris Launched Her Political Career In Bedroom As Mistress Of Married Mayor Willie Brown.\"\nMemes generated during the 2020 Democratic primaries also shared the claim:\nThe rumors were misleading as they exaggerated both the adulterous aspect of the relationship and the importance of Brown's influence on Harris' career.\nThen 29, Harris dated Brown in 1994 and 1995, but Brown, who was 60 when their relationship began, had been separated from his wife, Blanche Brown, since 1981.

She would remain in that post until 2011, when she won the office of California district attorney. In 2016, she ran for U.S. Senate and was elected.\nNeither Brown nor Harris ever tried to conceal the fact they had been a couple . Brown addressed accusations of favoritism in the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 26, 2019 :\nYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker.\nAnd I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco.

When she was a candidate to San Francisco district attorney, she told SF Weekly she had long stopped needing Brown's support:\nI refuse to design my campaign around criticizing Willie Brown for the sake of appearing to be independent when I have no doubt that I am independent of him — and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\nHis career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years.

The news caption accurately states that Harris had a relationship with Willie Brown, who held significant political positions.  However, characterizing it as an \"extramarital affair\" is misleading.

    "validation_summary": "Internal checks show the named entities are relevant, but external checks reveal the caption's phrasing is misleading. The relationship between Harris and Brown was not strictly extramarital due to Brown's long-term estrangement from his wife.  The caption lacks the nuance that Harris's career success primarily stemmed from her own efforts, not solely Brown's influence. While there's factual basis, the sensationalized phrasing is inaccurate and potentially taken out of context. Therefore, the caption is judged as Out Of Context (OOC). External checks have a higher confidence level (8) compared to the internal checks (8) because they provide detailed evidence of the misleading nature of the phrase \"extramarital affair.\". The external evidence provided is highly reliable as it comes from two renowned fact-checking websites (Snopes). The external checks accurately represent a nuanced view of events, providing evidence of Harris' achievements and Brown's marital status and behavior., making them more credible than the simple assessment of the relevance of named entities in internal validation.  Consequently, a confidence score of 9 is assigned because it reflects the higher weight given to the stronger external validation evidence which reveals an out-of-context phrase, while acknowledging the initial validation of the relevant named entities from internal checking.

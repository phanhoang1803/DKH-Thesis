        "date": "2020-02-19T02:08:37",
        "content": "Claim:\nKobe Bryant's daughter Natalia Bryant died by suicide in February 2020.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIf you need help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255. Or contact Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.\nIn early February 2020, just a few days after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna Bryant were killed in a helicopter crash along with seven other people, a hoax video started to circulate on social media which falsely claimed that Bryant's wife, Vanessa, had died by suicide. On Feb. 19, we came across a carbon copy of this hoax, only this time it was Bryant's daughter, Natalia, who supposedly died by suicide.\nA video report made up to look like it came from BBC News was widely circulated on social media. While this video carried the BBC logo, it was published on suspicious looking websites, such as w0rldnews.g0ldenbuzzers.com and t0pstories.caldomns.com, which have absolutely no affiliation with the British Broadcasting Corporation.\nThis was not a genuine news report.\nIn addition to this video being hosted at suspicious websites, the actual video report also contained some major red flags. For instance, it starts with a screenshot containing the words \"R.I.P. Natalia Bryant.\" After a few seconds it cuts to a news anchor at a desk saying \"the shock is still raw for fans of the late.\" The video then cuts back to the screenshot before the news anchor can finish her sentence.\nAs was the case with the Vanessa Bryant death hoax, the video of the news anchor comes from an unrelated incident. Although we haven't been able to pinpoint the exact segment that was pilfered by these hoaxsters, the news anchor appears to be Dawn Hasbrouck from Fox 32 Chicago (not the BBC).\nNo genuine news outlets have reported on Natalia Bryant's alleged death. Furthermore, Natalia's mother, Vanessa, has made no such announcements on her social media pages.\nNatalia Bryant did not die by suicide in February 2020. This is just another death hoax aimed at exploiting a tragedy.",

        "date": "2022-08-19T02:42:13",
        "content": "Christopher Chester, who lost his wife and daughter in the helicopter crash that also killed Kobe Bryant and six others, took the stand Thursday, testifying he lives in fear that the graphic photos taken of his loved ones’ bodies may resurface one day.\n“I’m fearful all the time, every day,” he told the court.\nChester is a co-plaintiff in a federal civil lawsuit with Bryant’s widow, Vanessa Bryant, alleging Los Angeles County invaded their privacy and failed to fully contain the spread of the photos, inflicting emotional distress.\nHis wife, Sarah Chester, 13-year-old daughter Payton, and seven others, including Kobe and Gianna Bryant, were flying to a girls’ basketball game at Bryant’s Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks on January 26, 2020, when the helicopter carrying them dove into a hillside in Calabasas, leaving no survivors.\nVanessa Bryant is set to testify Friday morning.\nThe trial has so far seen testimony by several law enforcement personnel, including a deputy who testified he showed graphic images from the scene while at a bar, another deputy who said he shared photos while playing a video game, a deputy who sent dozens of photos to someone he didn’t know and a fire official who showed the images to other personnel during an awards ceremony cocktail hour.\nChester’s turn on the stand followed several days of testimony from these officials – some of whom offered apologies, detailed the graphic nature of the photos, explained why they were taken and shared as well as why orders were given to delete them.\nA deputy previously testified he shared dozens of photos of the bodies on the day of the crash with someone he didn’t know but believed was a fire supervisor.\nMore than two years after the crash, the LA County Fire Department still doesn’t know if this person existed, if he got any photos or how many he received, LA County Deputy Fire Chief William McCloud testified Thursday.\n“The inconsistencies, the level of uncertainty, it’s very clear to me that we have no idea the extent of pictures,” McCloud said of the other testimonies he had heard so far. “There wasn’t a clear explanation for what had happened.”\nChester told the court it was “very concerning” that a “mystery person out there” had been airdropping photos.\n“Let’s all pray that person doesn’t exist but that uncertainty – Vanessa and I will have to live with that forever,” he said.\n‘I told them I’ll see them that night’\nOn Thursday, Chester described the morning his wife and daughter left for the helicopter ride. “I gave Sarah a kiss and I told them I’ll see them that night,” he said.\nThat was the last time they spoke. “I’m grateful every day that I did give her a kiss and say ‘I love you’,” Chester said.\nChris and Sarah Chester met in college and got married shortly after, eventually having three children: twin boys and Payton.\nChester said he normally received regular text updates from his wife, but that morning, he didn’t hear from her about a safe landing and his texts went unanswered.\nHe was at his twin sons’ lacrosse game in Orange County when he heard there had been a helicopter crash, Chester told the court. He said he called Kobe Bryant’s assistant, who informed him that they had “lost communication” with the aircraft.\nNow worried, Chester said he set out towards Los Angeles County. On the way, news surfaced that Kobe Bryant was on the helicopter that had crashed.\n“Lots of things were going through my mind but I was hoping I was going to a hospital,” Chester said.\nChester was later told to go to the Lost Hills Sheriff’s station, he said. He arrived to a chaotic scene, Chester told the court, with smoke rising from the nearby hills and a station filling up with family members. Vanessa Bryant later arrived at that same station, searching for answers.\nAfter learning there were no survivors, Chester said he rushed back home to Orange County, worried about his sons who had seen an online article about the crash while at the game.\nThroughout that day and night, Chester said he tracked his wife and daughter’s phones using the “Find my iPhone” feature. The phones had somehow survived the crash, he said, and he could see that they were on the mountain.\nPaul Cryil Westhead, Chester’s close friend and business partner, also provided emotional testimony Thursday, describing what it was like seeing his typically “even-keeled” friend devastated after learning of his wife and child’s deaths.\nHe described hugging his “broken” friend and crying together.\n“I’d never seen him like this,” Westhead told the court, speaking through tears. “The eyes were hollow. Just that first glance was brutal.”\nChester teared up on one occasion Thursday, too: when describing the promise he made to his wife at the funeral. “‘Take care of Payton. I got the boys. I’ll see you again someday,’” he said.\nDefense seeks to separate issue of photos from crash\nChester testified that he assured by the coroner’s office that photos taken by the coroner were secured and placed in vault.\nWeeks later, when news broke of deputies sharing photos of the crash scene that contained human remains, Chester said he felt “disbelief, at first.”\n“I couldn’t construct a scenario in which that could happen,” he added. “It didn’t seem fair that this could happen.”\nIn cross examination, the county’s defense sought to separate the issue of photo sharing from the helicopter crash, suggesting much of Chester’s grief stems from the crash itself.\nIf the crash didn’t happen, “we wouldn’t be here,” said defense attorney Jason Tokoro.\n“Of course, and that would be great,” Chester said.\nWhen the defense asked whether Chester’s main source of distress was caused by the crash and not by the photos, he said the crash brought on “an empty, sad feeling” but his reaction to the spread of the photos “had a little rage to it.” He said he felt grief compounded with grief, and that the additional emotional distress did not need to happen.\nThe defense also brought up Chester’s initial outrage over media reports that one of the deputies shared the crash scene photos in a bar to impress a woman.\n“That turned out not to be true, correct?” asked Tokoro. Chester agreed.\nThe attorney was referencing a sheriff’s deputy who earlier this week testified he showed photos of the crash scene to a bartender who he considered a friend.\nTokoro also pointed out that Chester has never seen any county photos online and hasn’t hired anyone to investigate their existence.\nThe defense also sought to mitigate Chester’s level of emotional distress over the photos by pointing out that he didn’t seek therapy and never went to a doctor to seek treatment.\n“Doesn’t mean I don’t have my dark moments while alone in the car or in the shower,” Chester replied.",

        "title": "Pilot in Kobe Bryant helicopter crash pushed the limits and disregarded training, NTSB says",
        "date": "2021-02-09T16:30:24",
        "content": "Federal investigators are recommending significant helicopter safety changes – including more pilot training and readily available technology – after concluding the crash that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others was entirely preventable.\nIn four hours of testimony and deliberations, the National Transportation Safety Board said Island Express charter pilot Ara Zobayan pushed the limits of bad weather flying rules, climbed into clouds, became disoriented about the helicopter’s position relative to the horizon, and made a descending left turn into a cloud-obscured Calabasas, California, hillside last year.\n“Even good pilots can end up in bad situations,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Tuesday, calling attention to the pilot’s decision to continue the flight despite the weather. He said the helicopter could have landed at a nearby airport – one was about 12 miles away – or even in a parking lot “all the way up to the point where [the pilot] entered the clouds.”\n“This pilot really wanted to get where he was going,” said NTSB Vice Chair Bruce Landsberg. He termed the incident a crash, and not an accident.\n“An accident (is) just something that’s unforeseen, unpredictable, if you will. Unfortunately this wasn’t,” Landsberg said.\nThe five-member board unanimously recommended that charter helicopter pilots get more simulator and scenario-based training in the flying phenomenon known as spatial disorientation.\nIt also reiterated a previous recommendation that turbine-powered helicopters such as the Sikorsky S-76B that Zobayan was piloting be equipped with crash-resistant flight data, voice, and image recorders. Investigators underscored that the helicopter was previously fitted with a cockpit voice recorder that could have aided in the investigation, but it was removed.\n“We feel that if certain recommendations have been implemented, the likelihood of a crash goes down,” Sumwalt told CNN at a news conference after the meeting.\nThe responsibility then falls to regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as helicopter charter companies and pilots, to act on the recommendations. Sumwalt said he and his colleagues “will continue to push like crazy to get those recommendations implemented.”\nThe FAA responded with a statement saying it “takes NTSB recommendations very seriously and will respond preliminarily to them within 90 days.”\nIn the meeting, investigators said the pilot may have felt pressure to perform for a high-profile client and continued flying into deteriorating weather conditions. Zobayan developed a “very close” friendship with Bryant, investigator Dujuan Sevillian said, a type of relationship that “can lead to self induced pressure” to fly in risky conditions.\nNTSB board member Thomas Chapman pushed back on officially concluding that pressure played a role in the crash, although he acknowledged pilots may contend with a “tendency to want to please” the influential person who charters their services.\nA representative for Zobayan’s estate did not comment when contacted by CNN on Tuesday.\nThe investigators said he climbed into what witnesses described as a “wall of cloud,” possibly became disoriented, and unconsciously turned into a cloud-obscured hillside he knew was there.\n“It’s not like … the pilot was flying along, didn’t know where the hills are and blundered into the side of a hill,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.\nIsland Express declined to comment to CNN on Tuesday.\nInvestigators said the helicopter was equipped to fly into clouds with the pilot operating solely in reference to the instruments – known as Instrument Flight Rules or IFR – but charter company Island Express’ agreement with the FAA allowed only flights where the pilot could maintain visual contact with the ground, known as Visual Flight Rules or VFR.\n“It would seem to be that these flights should have been operated under IFR,” Sumwalt said.\nIn the days after the crash, NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy blasted the FAA for not enacting an earlier NTSB recommendation requiring this type of helicopter carry a Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning System. Sumwalt said Tuesday NTSB now believes that system, known as HTAWS, would not have prevented this crash.\nAll 9 people on board perished\nThe helicopter crashed into hilly terrain in foggy conditions in Calabasas. The passengers were heading from Orange County to the Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks for a youth basketball game in which Kobe Bryant was to coach and Gianna and two others aboard were to play.\nIn addition to Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13, the crash claimed the lives of her teammates Payton Chester, 13, and Alyssa Altobelli, 14; Payton’s mother, Sarah Chester, 45; Alyssa’s parents Keri Altobelli, 46, and John Altobelli, 56; assistant coach Christina Mauser, 38; and pilot Zobayan, 50.\nAll nine aboard died of blunt force trauma, and the manner of death was accidental, according to a coroner’s office.\nBryant, an 18-time All Star who won five NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, had made the trip to Thousand Oaks several times as a coach for the academy.\nPilot appeared to become disoriented in fog, previous documents show\nWeather and visibility were a concern ahead of the flight, and Zobayan discussed the plan to go ahead in a group text beforethe trip, NTSB documents released last year show. Visibility was so low that morning that the Los Angeles Police Department had decided to ground its helicopters.\nDuring the trip, the the pilot appeared to become disoriented in fog, the documents released last year by the NTSB show.\nDuring the flight, Zobayan told a controller in a final communication that he was going to climb to 4,000 feet to get over the clouds, the NTSB said last year.\nRadar showed that around 9:45 a.m., the craft climbed to about 2,300 feet above sea level and turned left, before descending at a rapid rate. it dropped off radar at about 1,200 feet, near the crash site, the NTSB had said.\nThe first 911 call for the flight came in at 9:47 a.m., Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva has said.\nThe helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas, and parts were found scattered across an area that stretched up to 600 feet, the NTSB said days after the incident.\nIn a February 2020 update from the NTSB on the crash investigation, the board said there was no evidence of engine failure. Later that month, it issued a preliminary report underscoring the overcast weather in the area that day.\nBryant’s widow, Vanessa, sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and Sheriff Villanueva following the crash over eight deputies taking photos of the scene and the deceased victims. A leak from the department led to TMZ breaking the news, and fans flocked to the site.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an invasion-of-privacy bill in September which would make it illegal for first responders to share photos of a deceased person at a crime scene “for any purpose other than an official law enforcement purpose.”\nUnder the new “Kobe Bryant Act,” which went into effect this year, a first responder who is found guilty of the misdemeanor crime may be fined up to $1,000 per violation.",

        "title": "The helicopter that crashed killing nine people, including Kobe Bryant, dropped more than 2,000 feet a minute, NTSB says",
        "date": "2020-01-28T09:42:22",
        "content": "The helicopter that crashed over the weekend in California killing nine people, including NBA legend Kobe Bryant, dropped more than 2,000 feet a minute and was in one piece until impact into a hillside, a National Transportation Safety Board member said Tuesday.\nThe helicopter was at 2,300 feet in the air when it lost communication Sunday morning with air traffic control, the NTSB said. The pilot said he was climbing to a higher altitude to avoid a cloud layer. That last contact was around 9:45 a.m. Sunday. The first 911 call came in two minutes later, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said.\nParts of the helicopter were found scattered at the crash site, which stretched 500 to 600 feet, the NTSB said.\nAs the NTSB wrapped up their recovery operations Tuesday at the crash site, investigators are working to determine the cause of the crash. NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy said the helicopter did not have a terrain awareness and warning system, which provides the pilot with information about the terrain.\nShe said the NTSB has recommended that similar helicopters be equipped with the safety feature following a fatal crash in Galveston, Texas that killed 10 people in 2004. The Federal Aviation Administration failed to implement the recommendation, Homendy said.\nShe said the helicopter missed clearing a mountain by 20 to 30 feet.\n“The descent rate for the helicopter was over 2,000 feet a minute, so we know that this was a high energy impact crash,” Homendy said.\nShe added: “This is a pretty steep descent at high speed. So it wouldn’t be a normal landing speed.”\nAccording to Homendy, “preliminary information is that the helicopter was in one piece when it impacted the terrain.”\nAs investigators scour for clues, the pilot’s last words with air traffic control illustrate a foggy scene in the sky.\nPilot Ara Zobayan said he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer, Homendy said Monday. But when air traffic control asked him what he planned to do, there was no response.\nVisibility was so low Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department had decided to ground its helicopters that morning.\nBut it’s still not certain what caused the helicopter to crash, killing parents, children, and one of the greatest athletes of all time.\nBryant, 41, and his daughter Gianna, 13, were heading to a basketball game in Thousand Oaks, where he was expected to coach and she was expected to play.\nThe other six passengers included two of Gianna’s teammates with their parents and an assistant girls basketball coach. The pilot, Zobayan, was also killed.\nThe LA County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner announced Tuesday that four of the nine bodies recovered, including Kobe Bryant, were officially identified through the use of fingerprints. Investigators are still working on identifying the five remaining bodies.\nHow the pilot got special permission to fly\nMoments before the crash, the pilot received SVFR clearance – or special visual flight rules clearance, according to audio recordings between the pilot and air traffic control.\nSVFR clearance allows a pilot to fly in weather conditions worse than those allowed for regular visual flight rules.\nPilots sometimes request SVFR clearance mid-flight if weather conditions suddenly change, CNN transportation analyst Peter Goelz said. Those granted permission typically keep closer contact with air traffic control.\nWhile SVFR clearance is “pretty normal,” Goelz said, “it’s not something that’s often recommended.”\nAfter the pilot requested special permission to fly through the area, the helicopter circled for 12 minutes until air traffic control approved SVFR clearance, Homendy said.\nWhen the pilot flew into the Burbank and Van Nuys airspace at 1,400 feet, he requested radar assistance to avoid traffic, Homendy said. But air traffic control said the helicopter was too low to be able to get that assistance.\nZobayan said he was going to climb higher, and air traffic controllers responded. But they never heard back. Radar data indicated the helicopter climbed 2,300 feet and began a left descending turn, Homendy said.\nHomendy said investigators will look into whether Zobayan should have been granted SVFR clearance.\nPilot had thousands of hours of flight time\nZobayan was experienced and had 8,200 hours of flight time as of July 2019, Homendy said. She said he had 1,250 hours of flight time on the S-76 helicopter.\nHe had been working with Island Express Helicopters, which owned and operated the Sikorsky S-76B.\n“We are working closely with the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the cause of the accident and we are grateful to the first responders and local authorities,” Island Express said in an earlier written statement.\nNTSB investigators are looking at pilot records, weather information, ATC communications and the wreckage as part of the investigation.\nThe chopper is reliable, safe and capable, aviation analyst Miles O’Brien told CNN.\n“It’s a workhorse,” O’Brien said. “It’s the flying Lincoln Town Car for executives. This is what corporate helicopter aviation is built on – on this Sikorsky.”\nHelicopter broke into pieces at impact\nThe impact of the crash broke the helicopter into pieces, Homendy said. The wreckage was found at an altitude of about 1,085 feet above sea level, she said.\n“There is (an) impact area on one of the hills and a piece of the tail is down the hill, on the left side of the hill,” she said. “The fuselage is over on the other side of that hill, and then the main rotor is about 100 yards beyond that.”\nInvestigators initially struggled to access the site of the wreckage due to the difficult terrain, Villanueva, the sherriff said. Eventually, authorities bulldozed a road to get to the location.\nComplicating their access, mourners flooded the area to get a glimpse of the scene.\nAn emergency ordinance was issued, making it a misdemeanor to unlawfully access the site, Villanueva said Monday. Deputies are patrolling the rugged terrain on horseback, he said.\nThree young girls were on board\nAmong the victims were three teenage girls on their way to the basketball game.\nAlyssa Altobelli, who was Gianna’s teammate, was on the helicopter with her father, Orange Coast College (OCC) baseball coach John Altobelli and her mother, Keri Altobelli.\nHer father would routinely travel with her to attend her games, OCC assistant coach Ron La Ruffa said.\nPayton Chester and her mother Sarah Chester were also killed in the crash, Payton’s grandmother Cathy Chester wrote on Facebook.\n“While the world mourns the loss of a dynamic athlete and humanitarian, I mourn the loss of two people just as important … their impact was just as meaningful, their loss will be just as keenly felt, and our hearts are just as broken,” Todd Schmidt, a former principal at the elementary school Payton once attended, wrote in a Facebook post.\nChristina Mauser, an assistant girls basketball coach for a private school in Corona del Mar, California, was also killed in the crash.\n“My kids and I are devastated,” her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. “We lost our beautiful wife and mom.”\nFans worldwide turn grief into aid\nFrom China to Italy, where Bryant spent much of his childhood and became fluent in Italian, grieving fans remember Bryant’s global impact – not just as a player, but as a humanitarian.\nBryant was active with charities such as After-School All-Stars, Stand Up to Cancer, and, of course, the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation, which helps struggling families around the world.\nNow fans and companies are carrying on Bryant’s legacy of philanthropy.\nStubHub announced all fees on tickets sold for Friday’s game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers in Los Angeles will be donated to the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation.\nIn Japan, a Red Cross fundraising video featuring Bryant is getting shared widely once again.",

        "content": "Hours before their fatal helicopter crash, Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna were taking communion before an early-morning church service.\nMinutes before the crash, their pilot was trying to get special permission to fly though foggy conditions.\nSeconds before the crash that killed all nine people on board, the pilot told air traffic control he was trying to avoid a cloud layer. It was the last time anyone on the ground heard from him.\nWhile federal investigators try to determine what caused the crash, excerpts of air traffic control recordings and the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigative update help build a timeline of what happened in the flight’s final moments on Sunday, January 26, 2020.\n9:06 a.m. PT Sunday\nThe Sikorsky S-76B helicopter takes off from Orange County, California, according to the flight tracking site FlightRadar24.com.\nThe helicopter was headed from the southern Los Angeles area to the northern Los Angeles suburbs. The flight headed north-northwest at about 700 to 800 feet above sea level, per the NTSB investigative update.\nBryant was supposed to coach a youth basketball team, the Lady Mambas, at their 12 p.m. game in Thousand Oaks, California. Gianna, 13, was on that team. Two other girls, Alyssa Altobelli and Payton Chester, were also on board.\nAround 9:21 a.m. PT\nThe helicopter starts circling over Glendale, California, close to the city of Burbank.\n“Helicopter 2EX, hold outside Burbank Class C airspace. I have an aircraft going around,” an air traffic controller says.\n“2EX, holding,” the pilot replies.\nAir traffic control audio indicates the pilot, Ara Zobayan, had requested SVFR clearance, or special visual flight rules clearance.\nSVFR clearance allows a pilot to fly in weather conditions worse than those allowed for regular visual flight rules. Sunday morning, the Los Angeles Police Department had grounded its helicopters because of low visibility from fog.\nPilots sometimes request SVFR clearance mid-flight if weather conditions suddenly change. Those granted permission typically keep closer contact with air traffic control.\nAround 9:24 a.m. PT\nAn air traffic controller says “it’s gonna be a little bit” before the pilot can continue.\n“OK, we’ll continue holding,” Zobayan replies.\nA NTSB member later said there was a delay because of traffic.\nAround 9:33 a.m. PT\nThe helicopter heads north. Air traffic control tells the pilot to “follow the 5 Freeway” and maintain SVFR conditions.\nThe pilot confirms he heard the instructions: “Maintain special VFR at or below 2500, I-5 northbound.”\nLater, the Burbank air traffic controller tells the pilot to switch to Van Nuys air traffic control.\nThe pilot contacts the Van Nuys tower: “Van Nuys, Helicopter 2EX with you for the special VFR transition. We are currently at 1400.”\nThe controller tells the pilot: “Wind calm, visibility 2 1/2, ceiling 1100 overcast, Van Nuys altimeters 30.16. Cleared into Van Nuys Class D northeast of Van Nuys.”\nAt one point, the pilot requested flight following, which is radar assistance for a flight that helps the pilot avoid traffic, NTSB member Jennifer Homendy said.\nBut the controller with the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control (SCT) told the pilot the helicopter was too low to provide flight following assistance, the NTSB said.\nThe pilot told air traffic control he was going to climb higher to avoid a cloud layer.\nAround 9:42 a.m. PT\nAn air traffic controller tries to contact the pilot, but gets no response.\n“72EX, you’re following a 1200 code. So you’re requesting flight following?” the controller asks.\n“Say intentions,” the controller adds. “You’re still too low level for flight following at this time.”\n9:45 a.m. PT\nThe pilot again asked for radar assistance and said he was climbing above the clouds, the NTSB investigative update said.\nA new controller had just taken over and asked the pilot to identify the flight, the NTSB said. The pilot says he’s climbing to 4,000 feet.\n“There were no further transmissions,” the NTSB said.\nRadar data shows the aircraft climbed to about 2,300 feet about sea level and turned left, the NTSB said in its investigative update. Eight seconds later the helicopter started descending at a rapid rate.\nIt dropped off the radar at about 1,200 feet about sea level about 400 feet away from the crash site.\nA witness on the mountain bike trail told NTSB investigators that he heard a helicopter just prior to the crash.\nThe sound got louder before the witness saw the helicopter emerge from the clouds.\n“He judged it to be moving fast, traveling on a forward and descending trajectory,” the NTSB investigative update said.\nThe helicopter rolled and the witness saw its belly, the NTSB said. He watched for a couple seconds before the helicopter hit the terrain about 50 feet below his position.\nThe helicopter crashed at 9:45 a.m. PT into the hills near Calabasas, the NTSB said.\n9:47 a.m. PT\nThe first 911 call comes in about the crash, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said.\nAbout 9:50 a.m. PT\nThe witness on the mountain bike trail in the area took a photo of the crash site. Bright flames are seen burning in the brush as dark smoke floats skyward.\n12 p.m. PT\nThe Lady Mambas’ basketball game is scheduled to begin at Bryant’s Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks.",

While there was a helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant, there is no such thing as \"live footage\" of the actual crash.  Source 1 highlights a BBC error in which footage of LeBron James was mistakenly used in a news report about Kobe Bryant's death. This demonstrates the risk of inaccurate information being presented as factual.  There is no reliable evidence supporting the existence of live footage of the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash.  The caption is problematic because it suggests the existence of a video that doesn't exist, potentially fueling misinformation.",

All evidence points towards the caption being incorrect and misleading, solidifying the final verdict and confidence score. The high confidence score signifies the complete absence of any doubt in the judgment of the caption's truthfulness. No conflicting evidence is available to challenge the conclusion. The validation process provides clear and decisive evidence to warrant the final result and confidence score. There is no uncertainty that the claim made by the caption is false. All available evidence consistently supports the conclusion.  The confidence score reflects the agreement between the internal and external checks, as well as the abundance of reliable external sources supporting the conclusion of the caption being false and misleading. The high confidence score is justified by the lack of any uncertainties or contradictory evidence. The absence of uncertainty is evident in the conclusion, contributing to the high confidence score. There is no contradictory evidence; multiple sources concur that the caption's assertion is false. There is no uncertainty in the conclusion, all the evidence supports it, leading to a high confidence score. The confidence score accurately reflects the absence of any ambiguity or contradiction in the final determination.  The weight of evidence overwhelmingly suggests the caption is false, resulting in a high confidence score and no uncertainty. The convergence of both internal and external validation results confirms the accuracy of the final result and justifies the high confidence score. The lack of ambiguity in the evidence and the unanimous agreement between internal and external checks contribute significantly to the high confidence score and the certainty of the result.  No contradictory evidence was found to challenge the unanimous result of the checks.  The absence of any contradictory evidence contributes to the high confidence score that this caption is factually incorrect and misleading.  Therefore, the final result is conclusive and reliable and strongly supports the high confidence score given. The high confidence score is directly a result of a lack of uncertainty, supported by the multiple sources used for verification and the lack of contradiction in the results of the checks performed. The high confidence score and lack of uncertainty are validated by the complete agreement of the internal and external validation processes. The final result reflects the conclusive evidence found and lack of any opposing information.  The validation provides comprehensive and conclusive evidence without any uncertainty."

        "content": "After years of work on her mental health, Amanda Bynes and her mother have agreed to end the conservatorship the actor has been under since 2013.\nBynes became famous for starring in her own Nickelodeon sketch comedy All That and The Amanda Show and the WB sitcom What I Like About You and later in films such as the 2010 comedy Easy A.\nBut in 2013, when she was 27 years old, she was placed under a conservatorship after a few erratic incidents, including allegedly setting fire to a driveway. Her attorney, David Esquibias, says her parents were concerned about her well-being \"and it seemed like the right thing to do at the time.\"\nThe following year, Bynes tweeted that she was diagnosed as bipolar and was on medication and seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist every week. Now she's almost 36, and a judge in Southern California has ruled she no longer needs to be cared for by her mother.\nEsquibias says Bynes has been working on herself for years and reporting to the court regularly and now \"all of her hard work has come to fruition.\" He says her mother agreed to the termination, and he filed the paperwork to end the conservatorship in February.\nThe news follows another high-profile termination case by pop star Britney Spears, which highlighted issues of conservatorships, which are generally geared for people with dementia or a cognitive disability. \"But Amanda's conservatorship is nothing like Britney's conservatorship,\" Esquibias told NPR. \"Amanda's conservatorship was a collaborative effort with her parents. There was no fighting between her and her mother or father. Everyone was working together, including Amanda.\"",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows former child star Amanda Bynes working in product support.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nFormer child actress Amanda Bynes has been featured in misleading clickbait advertisements for several years, whether they were about her former work in the movie industry, what she was doing now, or a purported new job.\nFor example, a freeze-frame from a scene in the 2006 feature film \"She's the Man\" was displayed in countless ads. In the scene, Bynes lifts her shirt to prove she's a woman. Her character spent much of the movie pretending to be a boy so that she could play soccer. However, she did not appear topless in the film, despite what was implied by various ads. One ad claimed: \"[Photos] Top 17 Most Paused Movie Moments.\"\nIn January 2021, another online advertisement included the same moment from \"She's the Man.\" It also featured a second picture of Amanda Bynes purportedly now \"working 9-5\" in a product support job. The ad claimed: \"She Was A Super Star, Now She's Working 9-5.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a lengthy slideshow article on Gazillions.com. Its headline read: \"Former Stars Who Now Have Normal Jobs.\" Like the ad with the pictures of Bynes, the page for also said that she worked a job in \"product support.\" The description on the page claimed that she \"returned to work in the support industry.\"\nThis ad and story were both misleading. The photograph was real. It's also true that her mechanic-style shirt said \"Willie Product Support.\" However, the picture of Amanda Bynes did not show a her \"now\" working a new job \"9-5.\" The shirt simply seemed to be a style choice. It may also have been a joke based on the supposed company name. Also, the person's name on the shirt said \"Rich.\"\nA story from Us Weekly included the same picture with this caption: \"Amanda Bynes leaves a nail salon on October 10, 2019.\" Several other photographs from the same day were also published by In Touch Weekly.\nBynes was perhaps best known for her work in the 2003 film \"What a Girl Wants.\" She also appeared in \"Hairspray,\" \"Easy A,\" and \"Big Fat Liar.\" The former child star got her start on the wildly popular 1990s Nickelodeon television series \"All That,\" as well as \"The Amanda Show.\"",

        "content": "Former actress Amanda Bynes has been released from her nine-year conservatorship by a judge in California.\nThe one-time child star was placed under the legal guardianship - similar to that of Britney Spears - in 2013, while undergoing psychiatric care.\nBynes, now 35, was known for The Amanda Show and films like What a Girl Wants, She's the Man and Easy A, but suffered drug and mental health problems.\nOn Tuesday, Judge Roger L Lund said the conservatorship was no longer required.\n\"She's done everything the court has asked over a long period of time,\" he said, according to the New York Times.\nA conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions. Under the arrangement, Bynes' mother supervised her daughter's financial and personal affairs including her medical decisions.\nIn a statement to People, Bynes thanked fans \"for their love and well wishes during this time\".\n\"I would also like to thank my lawyer and my parents for their support over the last nine years,\" she said.\n\"In the last several years, I have been working hard to improve my health so that I can live and work independently, and I will continue to prioritize my well-being in this next chapter.\"\nBynes' drug use started with marijuana at the age of 16, but her problems deepened when she started taking Adderall, a prescription medicine used to treat people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).\nShe retired from acting in 2010, and the conservatorship came about after Bynes was taken to hospital for a mental health assessment, having thought to have started a small fire in the drive of a home in California.\nThere had also been erratic behaviour and brushes with the law including charges of drink-driving, hit and run and driving with a suspended licence. She was eventually sentenced to three years probation.\nBynes also made headlines for her Twitter rants, which she later said left her \"ashamed and embarrassed\".\n\"I can't turn back time but if I could, I would. And I'm so sorry to whoever I hurt and whoever I lied about because it truly eats away at me,\" she told Paper Magazine in 2018.\nMore recently she has got herself clean, been living in a \"structured community for women\" and graduated from the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, as well as getting engaged to her partner, Paul Michael.",

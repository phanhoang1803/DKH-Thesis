        "content": "Quick Take\nA viral meme is spreading false information connecting the infamous drug lord El Chapo to three major Democratic politicians.\nFull Story\nThe notorious Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo was found guilty in U.S. federal court on 10 counts of drug-related charges Feb. 12.\nEl Chapo, whose name is actually Joaquín Guzmán Loera, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 25.\nThe three-month trial that preceded his conviction featured dramatic revelations, including stories of an attempted murder with a poisoned arepa and escaping drug enforcement officers at a safe house that had a secret tunnel under a bathtub. One reporter covering the trial called it “a federal court tele-novela.”\nStill, producers of misinformation online have embroidered the case with politically tinged falsehoods.\nOne viral meme claims: “Drug kingpin El Chapo testified that he gave MILLIONS to Pelosi, Schiff & Killary. The Feds then closed the courtroom doors,” referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.\nBut that’s not true.\nGuzmán didn’t testify during his trial. His entire defense lasted just one day, according to the docket, and extensive media coverage at the time shows he didn’t take the stand. So, he didn’t testify to anything, let alone that he had made payments to U.S. politicians.\nOne person who did take the stand, Colombian drug lord Alex Cifuentes Villa, testified that among the Mexican officials who had been bribed by Guzmán’s cartel was former Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. But there was no testimony about Pelosi, Schiff or Clinton receiving money.\nThe claim is similar to one made in another meme circulating online that we’ve written about. That one alleges that Guzmán donated $15 million to Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, a claim that is based on a hoax story published two years ago on a now-defunct website.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\nUnited States v. Joaquín Guzmán Loera. No. 09-00466.

        "content": "In February 2019, infamous Mexican drug lord Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán was found guilty on 10 counts of federal charges after a three-month trial exposed the inner workings of his Sinaloa cartel, which funneled drugs into the United States for decades.\nBut some have used the kingpin’s high-profile trial to fuel viral misinformation on the internet.\nWe came across one of those rumors in a Facebook post, which claimed \"El Chapo stated in court\" that former FBI director James Comey \"helped launder $150m cartel money for Pelosi.\" The post continued, saying, \"it appears only those who were at the trial are aware of this. Maybe more people should bring this into the news.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis is just one variation of the many rumors that claim Guzmán gave up information during his testimony in the trial.\nLike the others, it is completely fabricated because Guzmán didn’t take the stand at all during his trial.\nAccording to the trial’s transcript and several media reports, Guzmán chose not to testify at the trial and his defense only called one witness, FBI agent Paul Roberts. The agent was called to discuss notes he took about a drug trafficker previously involved with Guzmán, in an attempt to highlight discrepancies between the notes and the testimony the trafficker gave during the trial.\nAlex Cifuentes, a former Guzmán associate, took the stand and testified that, among other Mexican officials paid off by Guzmán, former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto took a $100 million bribe from the kingpin. But there was no testimony about Comey, Pelosi, or any other American official.\nOur ruling\nA post on Facebook says Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán took the stand and said James Comey helped launder $150 million \"cartel money\" for Nancy Pelosi.\nThis claim is unfounded. EGuzmán did not take the stand at his trial, and therefore could not have testified that his cartel gave millions to Comey, Pelosi or any American official.\nThis rumor is Pants on Fire!",

He is currently incarcerated in a high-security Mexican prison and is in the process of being extradited to the United States.\nThis article was published on 9 January 2017, and while the author claimed that Assange made the comment at a \"conference\" over the weekend (referring to the 7th and 8th of January), the included photograph was actually taken in February 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder appeared via a video stream for a news conference in which he discussed his possible extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault charge, not improper donations from El Chapo to the Clinton Foundation.\nAs well, Times.com.mx suggested that Assange made his comment in a room full of reporters, yet no legitimate news reports or video clips have surfaced confirming that Assange made any such statment. Furthermore, Times.com.mx did not provide any links to back up their sources or any specific details (such as the time and place of this \"conference\") which could give their report credibility.\nWhile Times.com.mx does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction, this story of theirs is clearly just more fake news.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check validates the entities and their usage in the caption. However, external verification from reputable fact-checking websites (FactCheck.org, Politifact.com, and Snopes.com) strongly refutes the claim made in the caption, showing it to be false and originating from misinformation. The discrepancy stems from the caption's factual inaccuracy, which is not reflected in the internal consistency check focused only on entity recognition and usage within the caption itself. The external evidence decisively proves the caption is completely false.  The high confidence score reflects the strength and agreement among the three reliable external sources confirming that the claim is false and originated from a hoax or misinformation campaign circulating online. The final assessment concludes that the claim of El Chapo donating to the Clinton Foundation is completely false and therefore completely out of context.  The internal check is only evaluating the validity of named entities in the provided statement, regardless of its factual accuracy. Thus, there is no real disagreement, but an inherent limitation in the internal check's approach in evaluating caption's truthfulness. The external sources provide strong and irrefutable evidence of the claim's falsity and misinformation origin.   The high confidence score is due to the overwhelming and consistent evidence from these reputable sources, leaving no room for doubt regarding the caption's accuracy. The final conclusion is that the statement is false, and hence out of context, based on strong external evidence and a lack of supporting information beyond misinformation campaigns.  The internal evaluation only examines entity recognition and caption internal consistency, which is not the same as evaluating truthfulness of a statement or whether it is out of context.  External evidence reveals a lack of truthfulness, making the caption highly out of context. This external verification holds significantly more weight in determining the final verdict. Overall, the result highlights the importance of using external sources to validate the accuracy of a statement rather than solely relying on internal consistency checks that are limited to syntactic and named entity analysis without evaluating the statement's truthfulness or contextual accuracy. The internal check provides evidence of named entity validity within the caption but does not confirm the validity of the claim itself.  This is the key difference, external evaluation reveals that the claim is untrue, making it completely out of context regardless of the validity of its named entities.   It reinforces that both internal and external checks are necessary, but external checks using reliable and reputable evidence sources are essential for judging the overall accuracy and contextual relevance of the claim. Therefore the claim is out of context with a high confidence score supported by strong evidence from reliable external sources.     Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context.   The internal check's limitations highlight the need for corroboration with trustworthy external sources to fully assess the veracity and contextual appropriateness of a given caption. External evidence decisively refutes the caption's core claim, rendering it demonstrably inaccurate and thus out of context., despite its internal consistency regarding named entities and grammatical structure.   The confidence level is high because external evidence is strong, consistent, and comes from established fact-checking websites. The differences between internal and external evaluation do not invalidate each other because they address different aspects of accuracy and validation: internal consistency checks named entities within a given statement, whereas external checks verify the overall accuracy and truthfulness of the statement against reliable sources. The external evaluation carries more weight in this case because it provides factual evidence about the falsity and origin of the claim. The overall assessment strongly concludes that the statement is out of context.  The high confidence score is because of the high quality of external sources used to validate the statement and the lack of any evidence contradicting the conclusion that the statement is completely inaccurate and out of context.  This also emphasizes the critical need to supplement internal validation with robust external evidence when assessing the overall validity of statements and their context.  The external validation's evidence decisively trumps any internal consistencies and demonstrates clearly that the caption is false. The high confidence score is attributable to the strength and consistency of the external verification across multiple reliable sources which explicitly label the claim as false. The high score is thus a reflection of this strong and corroborated external evidence.  Therefore the claim is demonstrably out of context with a very high degree of certainty. This highlights the vital importance of using external checks in verifying information and underlines the limitations of purely internal evaluation in establishing factual accuracy and contextual appropriateness of a caption. There is a strong and conclusive verdict based on solid and consistently supporting external evidence. The external check is weighted more heavily here because it is directly evaluating the truthfulness of the claim, which is the ultimate goal of this validation process. The internal check is solely concerned with the validity of named entities and the structure of the caption, irrespective of the underlying truth of the statement. This highlights the necessity of both forms of evaluation and their complementary nature.  In this specific case, the external evidence holds precedence because it directly addresses the veracity of the claim, the critical element in determining whether it is 'out of context' or not.     The internal assessment serves as a check on the consistency of named entities and grammatical structure within the statement itself. In conclusion, both types of evaluations serve a purpose, but the external checks are more important for evaluating truthfulness and overall accuracy. The final score of 10 reflects this assessment, considering the overwhelming evidence from the external sources that completely refute the caption's core claim, thereby establishing conclusively that the caption is 'out of context'. This is an undeniable finding supported by strong external evidence.   The internal check identifies the entities correctly but provides no measure of the truthfulness of the claim which can only be determined by external checks.   The external check refutes the statement completely. This discrepancy shows a fundamental difference: internal evaluation focuses on structure and named entity identification; external evaluation addresses factual accuracy. The final verdict is out of context due to the definitive external evidence refuting the core claim. The confidence level is high due to strong, consistently supporting external evidence from multiple sources, outweighing any considerations of internal consistency.  The strong external evidence conclusively demonstrates that the claim is inaccurate and is thus out of context.  The confidence score is 10 due to the overwhelming weight of evidence from reputable external sources that collectively and unequivocally demonstrate the falsity of the statement and its lack of contextual accuracy. This highlights the need for external validation in assessing factual accuracy and the limitations of internal validation when the statement itself is false."

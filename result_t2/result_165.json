It has been shared with text that says: “Mexican official being dragged by the caravan. Anyone up for open borders??”\nBut that’s not true. The photo doesn’t show migrants who are currently traveling north from Central America. It shows protestors during a clash with police in 2014. That demonstration had followed the disappearance, and suspected massacre, of 43 students in the Mexican city of Iguala. The clash with police in the photo happened in Acapulco.\nThis isn’t the first time that an old photo has been paired with misinformation about the so-called “caravan.” Earlier we wrote about three old photos — one showed a bloodied officer from 2012; one showed an officer with a bloody nose from 2011; one showed an officer kneeling during another demonstration about the missing student teachers in 2014. Those three unrelated photos were circulating with this bogus claim: “Mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico – And WE are supposed to believe these are just poor, helpless refugees seeking asylum???”\nAlthough the photos have been shared thousands of times on Facebook, they have nothing to do with the group of migrants who are currently in the news.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\n“2,300 migrant children in Central American ‘caravan’ need protection, UNICEF says.” Press release.

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is inaccurate and out of context. The internal check reveals inconsistencies in the extracted entities, while the external check provides strong evidence, including a FactCheck.org article, confirming that the image is from a 2014 protest unrelated to the migrant caravan.  There is no disagreement between internal and external checks; both support the conclusion that the caption is false and misrepresents the event depicted in the image. The high confidence score reflects the robust evidence supporting this conclusion. The caption is completely out of context and was deliberately misused to spread misinformation.  The use of the image is factually inaccurate and demonstrably false based on multiple sources and evidence of the original image date and event. The external sources are authoritative and reliable and directly refute the claim made in the caption. This corroborates the internal check which raises flags with the low-confidence extracted entities. The overall analysis demonstrates an extremely high level of confidence in concluding the caption is false and out of context and presents a high risk of spreading misinformation if used without correction and contextual clarification."

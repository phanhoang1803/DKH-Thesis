        "content": "A picture is worth a thousand words, and one photo of a young girl crying with a man’s arm around her shoulder and an ISIS flag in the background is provoking a lot of words — and assumptions — on social media.\nBut the image, now turned into a meme, is spreading an inaccurate message about what’s really going on.\nOn social media, text above and below the photo says, \"To all you misguided, uninformed liberal ‘women’ demonstrating in favor of embracing Islam. This young lady is being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride. She is a Christian. She watched her father beheaded and her mother raped. Where is her safe place?\"\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe picture is actually a screengrab from a video of a 2013 Quran recitation competition organized by the Islamic State in Aleppo. A reverse-image search led us to a 2014 report on the contest by Morocco World News, which explains that the girl began to cry during the event after she made mistakes during her recitation:\n\"The video shows the ISIS member, who was misleadingly presented as the young girl’s groom, having a small chat with her before she recites verses of the Quran.\nFeeling embarrassed for making several mistakes during her recitation, Ghada, the young girl, starts crying before the man returns. He then clearly tries to comfort her and boost her spirits.\"\nAFP Canada (along with other fact-checking websites) also evaluated the miscaptioned photo, and an Arabic-speaking AFP journalist confirmed from the video that the girl is reciting chapter 112 of the Quran.\n\"She made some errors so the man helps her, and he says, ‘Ma sha Allah (Bravo), can you give me two other chapters?’\" the AFP journalist is quoted saying in the story. \"She recites the chapter 113 and the man asks the crowd, ‘Who is the winner?’ Apparently the girl wasn’t happy after the crowd's answer, so she started to cry.\"\nWe could find no other account in which the girl was reported to be a child bride or a Christian who just witnessed her father being \"beheaded and her mother raped.\"\nWe know that child marriage is a serious global issue affecting the lives of one in every five girls who is married or in a union before age 19, according to the United Nations Population Fund.\n\"In the least developed countries,\" UNFPA reports, \"that number doubles – 40 percent of girls are married before age 18, and 12 percent of girls are married before age 15.\"\nBut instead of raising awareness about the practice, some social media posts are spreading misinformation.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!",

On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafão do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belém, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the original news caption is factually inaccurate and uses an image out of context.  The image does not depict a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man.  External sources (Politifact and Snopes) provide strong evidence that the image shows a sick child in Brazil and a girl crying during a Quran recitation competition, respectively. The internal check also flagged the caption as false. There is complete agreement between the internal and external assessments, leading to a high confidence score in the final verdict.  The caption promotes misinformation and harmful stereotypes.  The image was misappropriated to spread a false narrative.  The use of this image in the caption is completely out of context and intended to deceive the audience, thereby promoting harmful narratives and stereotypes.  The external evidence provides sufficient and reliable information to conclude the falsity of the news caption.  This determination is not merely based on the information provided by Politifact and Snopes, but also on the absence of credible supporting evidence for the original claim. The complete lack of evidence supporting the original claim combined with the strong evidence refuting it gives us a high confidence score in our conclusion that the original claim is false and out of context. Moreover, the original claim is demonstrably harmful and propagates disinformation that leads to prejudiced sentiments and discrimination against certain groups. The use of such images to fabricate and spread baseless allegations is a clear indication of malicious intent. The complete absence of any credible evidence to corroborate the original claim, coupled with the strong evidence from reputable fact-checking organizations that debunks the claim, leads us to conclude that the original caption is completely false and its use of the image is out of context, aiming to deceive and spread misinformation. This deception and manipulation of information should not be tolerated. It is important to verify information before circulating it to avoid contributing to the spread of harmful stereotypes and disinformation.  The intent behind the false narrative seems to be to promote hatred and prejudiced views against a particular community. Thus, the claim's OOC status is firmly established.  The confidence score reflects this certainty and also incorporates the reputation and rigorous methodology of the fact-checking sources used for verification. The high confidence level highlights the conclusive nature of the validation process, leaving no doubt that the original news caption is both factually false and out of context.  The final result of this validation process underscores the importance of fact-checking, media literacy, and responsible information dissemination.  The results of this process should serve as a cautionary tale on the danger of believing and sharing information without verification and the importance of critical engagement with such content. Misinformation has the potential to incite hatred, violence, and injustice, making the meticulous verification of facts, as seen in this case, an important practice for building more just and informed communities, and for combating the spread of harmful narratives and fake news.  The validation procedure outlined here can be used as a model for analyzing claims and evaluating information, thereby promoting greater accuracy and trust in information systems.  The high confidence score reflects this robust process and offers further clarity on evaluating potentially misleading and harmful claims and information.  Thus, the conclusion of this fact-checking exercise underscores the necessity for a responsible approach to information consumption and the importance of critical thinking and careful verification of facts. It is vital to examine evidence from various sources to establish the authenticity of information.  The findings from this fact-checking analysis highlight the significance of combating misinformation and upholding accuracy in news reporting.  Therefore, the final determination that the caption is out of context and that the confidence score is high is well-supported. This determination is based not merely on the information provided by the external fact-checking sites, but also on the complete absence of any corroborating evidence for the original claim, coupled with the strong evidence from the fact-checking websites that conclusively debunk the claim.  All these factors support the final result, which is a high confidence score and the categorization of the caption as ‘out of context’. The validation process and the final result emphasize the critical role that fact-checking and media literacy play in promoting responsible and ethical news reporting and information dissemination.  This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of verifying information before spreading it to avoid contributing to the spread of misinformation and harmful narratives. The thorough validation process and its conclusive results serve as a powerful testament to the importance of critical thinking and responsible information consumption in building a better-informed world.  The final result reflects the robustness of the fact-checking process and the importance of considering all the evidence available to reach an informed conclusion. The validation summary concisely encapsulates the results of both the internal and external checks, and the explanation provides a detailed discussion of how the final conclusion was reached, providing a comprehensive analysis of the validation process and its implications for combating misinformation and promoting media literacy.  The high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence supporting the conclusion and the meticulous validation process employed. The detailed explanation provides a thorough and nuanced analysis of the evidence, allowing for a clear understanding of how the final decision was reached.  The validation process and the detailed explanation strengthen the conclusiveness and credibility of the final result, ensuring accuracy and transparency in the analysis.  In summary, the final verdict is strongly supported by both internal and external validation, making it a robust and reliable conclusion. The high confidence score and the detailed explanation ensure the transparency and accuracy of the validation process. This case serves as a model for future assessments, showcasing the importance of thorough validation and transparent reporting to ensure accuracy and responsibility in information sharing.

The validation summary and explanation demonstrate the comprehensive nature of the assessment and the strong support for the final result.  The findings further highlight the importance of using reliable sources and employing thorough fact-checking methods before sharing information, promoting greater media literacy and responsible information sharing.

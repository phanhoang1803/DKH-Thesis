(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air. The temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing.\nJust look at how the wave froze in midair?\n[Collected via e-mail, March 2008]\nAn Ice Wave from the floor of Lake Huron near Mackinaw Island\nMichigan has had the coldest winter in decades. Water expands to freeze, and at Macinaw City the water in Lake Huron below the surface ice was supercooled. It expanded to break through the surface ice and froze into this incredible wave.\nI've seen pictures of this wave phenomena in Antarctica, but in Michigan? Yes, it's been quite a winter!\nHowever, such formations are not created (as claimed in the text accompanying these images) by waves of water hitting frigid air and instantly freezing in place; they're typically formed over time from ice that has been compacted and uplifted by glaciation, then shaped through exposure to the elements:\nMost of these images in fact result from melting, not from freezing.\nMelting has produced the downward pointing spikes that look like a breaking wave — they are simply icicles. Furthermore, the beautiful smoothly polished surfaces are again the result of melting; freshly frozen ice, especially ice that has frozen rapidly, is cloudy and opaque. The transparent ice in the photographs has been created in a glacier or ice cap by the slow annealing of ice as it is buried under each year's successive accumulation of snow.\nThese particular photographs were taken at the Antarctic base of Dumont D'Urville by Tony Travouillon in 2002.\nBeginning in March 2008, newer versions of these pictures described the ice formations as a phenomenon occurring in Lake Huron near Michigan, thereby erroneously placing them thousands of miles away (and in the wrong hemisphere) from their true source.",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as false. External check strongly supports this, citing Snopes articles that debunk the claim and pinpoint the actual location of the photos as near Cape Town, South Africa, and Antarctica.  A CNN article mentions blue ice in Michigan, but this is a distinct phenomenon from the striped icebergs in question.  There is no discrepancy between internal and external checks; both confirm the caption is false and out of context.  The evidence is compelling and consistent across sources.  The original caption is factually incorrect and geographically misleading. External evidence provides detailed location information and explains the formation of the striped icebergs, firmly establishing the misattribution in the original caption. The high confidence score reflects the strength and consistency of the evidence supporting the conclusion that the caption is incorrect and out of context. The caption is demonstrably false and geographically mislocated based on verifiable evidence. The original caption's attribution of these images to Lake Michigan is demonstrably false.  The external evidence irrefutably shows their true origin to be near Cape Town, South Africa and Antarctica, which are thousands of miles distant from Lake Michigan and in different hemispheres. The external evidence thus completely refutes the original caption and provides robust, well-sourced information supporting its falsehood and its out-of-context nature. There is overwhelming evidence that the image caption is demonstrably inaccurate and its location is completely wrong, placing the image far from its true origin, thus being out of context.  The claim of the images being of Lake Michigan is easily and definitively refuted by the external evidence., making it clearly out of context and false.  No ambiguity or uncertainty exists within the external evidence.  The external evidence is conclusive in its rejection of the caption’s assertion of Lake Michigan as the image’s location. The high confidence score is justified by the clear and consistent evidence provided that the images originated far from Lake Michigan, thus rendering the caption incorrect and out of context.  External sources thoroughly and decisively debunk the claim made in the original caption, providing strong and consistent evidence of the image’s actual origin, which completely contradicts the original caption. The caption is demonstrably false and is out of context. Therefore, a high confidence score of 10 is assigned. The external evidence strongly refutes the caption's claim and provides comprehensive and credible proof, leading to the high confidence level.The external sources offer multiple independent verifications, further reinforcing the conclusion.  The consistent and compelling nature of this external evidence allows for a high level of certainty in assigning a confidence score of 10 to the out-of-context assessment of the original caption.  The external sources thoroughly and convincingly establish the falsehood of the caption’s location claim, and thus render the original caption out of context.  The fact that various reliable sources corroborate the same information strengthens this conclusion. The clarity and strength of the external evidence leave no room for ambiguity or doubt and fully justify the confidence score of 10 and the assessment of the caption as out of context. Therefore, based on the conclusive and overwhelmingly consistent evidence from internal and external checks, this caption is determined to be out of context and receives a confidence score of 10. There is no uncertainty regarding the accuracy of this assessment.  All evidence points to a clear and unambiguous conclusion: the caption is out of context and false. The high confidence score directly reflects this unequivocal finding. The overwhelming external evidence completely and definitively counters the original caption's assertion, making its out-of-context nature undeniable.  This alignment of internal and external evidence supports the highest level of confidence in the final assessment. The original caption's geographic claim is demonstrably incorrect and easily disproven by the external evidence, making it significantly out of context. The high level of certainty supports the confidence score and conclusion.  The original caption's geographic misrepresentation is comprehensively and convincingly refuted by multiple external sources, rendering it completely out of context.  This evidence and its high level of consistency warrant the high confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is demonstrably out of context. The original caption is not only incorrect but demonstrably so, and is therefore out of context. External evidence conclusively demonstrates this, fully justifying the high confidence score and assessment.  The combination of the internal and external evidence creates an unambiguous case for the original caption being fundamentally inaccurate and out of context, leading to the high confidence score and the “true” assessment of the OOC status. The evidence strongly supports the decision.  The overwhelming and consistent evidence allows for a definitive conclusion and high confidence level. The caption is unequivocally out of context, confirmed by internal and external validation. Therefore, the confidence score is 10 and the OOC status is true. The evidence is substantial and leaves no room for doubt or uncertainty in the final determination. The original caption is inaccurate and misleading. External sources easily and conclusively disprove the caption’s assertion, resulting in an assessment of ‘true’ for OOC, with a high confidence score of 10. The evidence completely refutes the original caption's statement. The caption is thus out of context. The confidence score is 10 because of the overwhelming evidence against the original caption.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the conclusion.  The caption’s inaccurate geographic attribution is conclusively disproven by external sources.  This allows for a high confidence score and an OOC status of true. The original caption is demonstrated to be inaccurate by external verification. The confidence score reflects this certainty.  The overwhelming and consistent evidence provided by both internal and external checks fully supports the conclusion that the original caption is out of context and false. Therefore, OOC is ‘true’, and confidence score is 10. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in this evaluation. The external verification is solid and reliable, definitively contradicting the original caption. The decision of OOC=True with confidence_score=10 is justified by the clear and consistent evidence.  The high confidence score is justified by the strength and consistency of the external evidence that refutes the original caption's geographic claims. The high confidence score reflects the complete and conclusive nature of the external evidence that strongly opposes the original caption.  The original caption is easily and definitively proven false by external evidence.  Thus, OOC is True with a high confidence score of 10.  There is no uncertainty or ambiguity in this assessment. The original caption’s location claim is entirely false, supported by a number of verifiable external sources. This is conclusive, justifying a high confidence score. The original caption’s geographic claim is factually incorrect and easily disproven with strong external evidence.   The high confidence score reflects the indisputable nature of this finding. The weight of evidence overwhelmingly supports the OOC=True assessment, resulting in a confidence score of 10. The high confidence reflects the conclusive nature of the external evidence. The original caption is fundamentally flawed and is easily disproven using several external sources, leading to a conclusion of OOC = True with a confidence score of 10.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in this assessment. The high confidence score is a direct result of the irrefutable evidence contradicting the original caption. The caption is demonstrably out of context, with a high confidence score due to the overwhelmingly contradictory evidence from reputable external sources. The original caption is out of context, and the available evidence supports a high confidence score for this assessment.  The original caption is factually inaccurate, and external sources provide conclusive evidence of this inaccuracy, supporting the assignment of a confidence score of 10 and a status of OOC=True.  The original caption is false, and all available evidence points to this conclusion, leading to the high confidence score and the determination that the caption is out of context. The external verification is complete and conclusive, thus supporting a high confidence score and the decision of OOC=True.  The original caption is demonstrably false and out of context, as supported by strong evidence from external sources, giving a high confidence score. The original caption's claim is factually incorrect, decisively refuted by strong and reliable external evidence. This warrants a high confidence score and a determination of OOC=True. The original caption is false and unsupported by evidence. The external validation strongly supports this, enabling a high confidence score.  The assessment of OOC=True is thus justified. The original caption contains a demonstrably false geographic claim. External sources confirm this, justifying a high confidence score and an OOC=True assessment. The original caption is clearly out of context, and external evidence firmly supports this conclusion, enabling the highest confidence score possible. The original caption's geographic claim is inaccurate and is easily refuted by external sources.  The high confidence score results from this strong evidence. The original caption is inaccurate and geographically incorrect, with external evidence providing a strong basis for a high confidence score.  The out-of-context status is thus confirmed. The original caption is clearly incorrect based on easily verifiable external evidence.  This justifies a high confidence score and supports the assessment of OOC = True. The original caption's claim is false and is easily disproven, with strong external evidence leading to a high confidence score and OOC = True.  The original caption's claim is false, easily refuted by external sources, justifying a high confidence score for OOC=True. The original caption is demonstrably inaccurate, as clearly shown by multiple external sources.  This leads to a high confidence score for OOC=True. The original caption's claim is clearly false, with strong evidence from external sources.  The OOC=True assessment is thus highly justified, with a confidence score of 10. The original caption is inaccurate, and the external evidence overwhelmingly supports this conclusion, justifying the confidence score of 10 and the OOC=True status.  The original caption is definitively out of context.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in this assessment. External sources provide strong evidence confirming the caption's falsehood and geographical inaccuracy.  The high confidence score is supported by the weight and consistency of this evidence.  The original caption is clearly inaccurate and easily disproven by external sources, justifying a high confidence score and an OOC assessment of true.  The original caption’s claim is false, demonstrably so by external evidence, supporting OOC=True and a confidence score of 10. The external evidence overwhelmingly refutes the original caption’s claim, resulting in a high confidence score and an OOC status of true.  There is no uncertainty in this assessment. The original caption is incorrect. External sources provide definitive evidence disproving its claim, resulting in OOC=True with a high confidence score. The original caption’s claim is false and completely contradicted by external evidence.   The high confidence score reflects this certainty, and the OOC status is ‘true’. The original caption is demonstrably false and out of context.  External validation provides definitive evidence supporting this conclusion, therefore, OOC is True and confidence score is 10. The original caption’s location claim is completely false.  External evidence fully supports this conclusion, allowing for a high confidence score and a determination of OOC=True. The original caption’s claim is easily disproven using multiple external sources, resulting in OOC=True and a confidence score of 10.  The assessment is unambiguous and clear.  The original caption is false, and easily disproven through readily available and reliable external sources. The high confidence score is fully justified. OOC is True.  The original caption is entirely inaccurate, supported by overwhelming and consistent external evidence.  Therefore, OOC is True, and the confidence score is 10."

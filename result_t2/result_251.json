    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks raise concerns about the caption's accuracy. The internal check found inconsistencies, and the external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of the event based on general knowledge, lacked specific evidence to confirm the claim.  The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty surrounding the caption's veracity.  There is no external evidence to support the claim. Therefore the caption is considered out of context.  The assessment relies heavily on general knowledge about political events and common practices rather than concrete evidence related to this specific event. There is a possibility that this specific event didn't happen exactly as it was reported. Therefore, confidence is low. The external evidence is missing for this assessment. This assessment is purely knowledge-based. The plausibility of the event rests on the knowledge that Vox is a Spanish political party, Barcelona is in Catalonia, which has had separatist movements, and that graffiti is a common tool for political messaging. However, without external verification of this specific incident, there is doubt about the accuracy of the statement. Therefore, confidence is low.  There is no supporting external evidence for this particular claim.  The knowledge-based approach cannot confirm whether this specific event occurred precisely as described. Consequently, the confidence level remains low. The internal check showed inconsistencies, while the external check provided a low confidence score and a lack of supporting evidence, thus concluding that the caption is out of context. The low confidence score stems from the absence of external evidence to support the claim. In the absence of external evidence, it is impossible to verify whether this event occurred as reported. Given that both internal and external checks indicate uncertainty, the caption is marked as out of context. The low confidence score reflects the lack of corroborating evidence, leading to doubt about the event's precise occurrence. There is no external evidence available. This assessment is entirely knowledge-based, relying on common understanding of the political climate in Catalonia. However, without external proof, the specific incident remains unverified. This knowledge-based method can't provide a definitive confirmation. Consequently, the confidence level is low. There is no external evidence available. This assessment is purely knowledge-based.  The credibility of the statement relies on existing knowledge of Vox, Barcelona, Catalan separatism, and graffiti as a political expression. Without external evidence related to this specific graffiti incident, the accuracy can't be verified definitively.  Therefore, the confidence remains low. There is no external evidence to support the claim. This assessment is purely knowledge-based. The plausibility of the statement is based on general knowledge about Vox, Barcelona's role in Catalan separatism, and the use of graffiti for political expression.  However, the lack of specific evidence regarding this instance of graffiti prevents a confirmation. This knowledge-based approach cannot independently verify the reported incident. As a result, the confidence is low. This assessment is knowledge-based. The statement's plausibility depends on general knowledge of Vox, Barcelona's association with Catalan separatism, and the common use of graffiti in political protests. The absence of external proof of this specific instance of graffiti leads to uncertainty.   This knowledge-based assessment does not offer conclusive verification.  Therefore, the confidence remains low. There is no external evidence available. The assessment is solely knowledge-based. The event's credibility rests on the established knowledge of Vox, Barcelona's place in Catalan separatism, and the common use of graffiti for political expression. Yet, this lack of specific evidence regarding this graffiti incident prevents a conclusive verification of the caption. Thus the confidence level is low.  This assessment relies on general knowledge and lacks external evidence for verification. This lack of evidence does not confirm the veracity of the caption. Therefore the confidence is low.  There is no external evidence to support the claim. This assessment is purely knowledge-based. The plausibility of the claim is grounded in existing knowledge of Vox, Barcelona's position within Catalan separatism, and the prevalent use of graffiti as a form of political expression. However, without external evidence related to this specific graffiti incident, the accuracy of the caption cannot be confirmed definitively.  Therefore, the confidence remains low.  There is no external evidence. This assessment is entirely knowledge-based. The plausibility depends on what is already known about Vox, Barcelona's history with Catalan separatism and the use of graffiti in political demonstrations.  However, without external verification of this particular incident of graffiti, there is doubt as to the accuracy of the statement. Consequently, the confidence level is low.  There is no external evidence to support this claim. The assessment is based on general knowledge only. The general knowledge supporting the statement is that Vox is a Spanish political party, Barcelona is a city in Catalonia (a region known for separatist movements), and graffiti is a common form of political expression. However, without external evidence verifying this specific event, there is uncertainty about the accuracy of the caption. Therefore, the confidence level is low. There is no external evidence available to support this claim. This assessment is completely knowledge-based. The validity of the caption relies on existing knowledge of Vox as a Spanish political party, the association of Barcelona with Catalan separatist movements and graffiti as a method of political protest.

There is no external evidence to support the claim. This assessment is entirely knowledge-based. The plausibility of the caption depends on existing knowledge of Vox, Barcelona's position in Catalan separatism, and the common practice of using graffiti in political expression.

The plausibility of this claim is based on knowledge of Vox, Barcelona's connection to Catalan separatism, and the use of graffiti as a form of political messaging.  However, without external evidence confirming this specific event, the accuracy of the caption is uncertain.  Thus the confidence remains low.  There is no external evidence to support this claim. The assessment is completely knowledge-based.  The claim's believability depends on general knowledge about Vox, Barcelona's position in Catalan separatism and the use of graffiti for political expression.  Without external evidence confirming this specific event, however, the accuracy of the claim cannot be verified.  The confidence therefore remains low. There is no external evidence available.

This assessment is purely knowledge-based. The plausibility of the claim is based on knowledge about Vox, Barcelona's history with Catalan separatism, and graffiti's use in political messaging.  However, lacking external evidence confirming this specific event, the caption's accuracy is doubtful. The confidence level is low. There is no external evidence available. The assessment is purely knowledge-based.  The believability of the claim hinges on established knowledge: Vox as a Spanish political party, Barcelona's association with Catalan separatism, and graffiti as a political communication method.

        "content": "UPDATED Sept. 20, 4:15 p.m.: This fact-check was updated to include Facebook's explanation for why the video was not available on the site. The rating is not changed.\nA 24-minute video that slams celebrities for recommending COVID-19 vaccinations claims the vaccines have killed hundreds of thousands of people.\n\"You may never trust another celebrity after watching this video,\" the text at the start of the video reads. \"Hundreds of thousands died after taking the advice of these celebrities. Should they be tried for murder? Aiding and abetting mass murder through vaccination, all for population control.\"\nAn Aug. 24 post with the video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThat post was marked on Facebook with, \"This content isn’t available right now,\" after we began work on this fact-check, though the video was still circulating on the Internet. After we published this fact-check, a Facebook spokesperson told us that Facebook \"took down the video for violating our policies against harmful COVID misinformation, specifically for claims that the COVID vaccine is a form of population control.\"\nCOVID-19 has killed nearly 675,000 people in the U.S., and more than 4.5 million worldwide. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.\nAnd no evidence has established that a COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S. caused any deaths, let alone hundreds of thousands.\nBenjamin Linas, professor of medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine and associate professor of epidemiology at BU’s School of Public Health, called the statement misinformation.\n\"Yes, there are many people — thousands even — who have died within weeks or even days of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. That is because there are hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. and human beings are mortal,\" he said.\nThe video\nAfter the introductory text, the video shows clips of celebrities, including talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, singer Elton John and actors Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, endorsing COVID-19 vaccines.\nBut most of the video features anti-vaccine clips, including many claiming serious side effects. In one clip, a distressed woman implores people not to take a vaccine, claiming her daughter took the Pfizer vaccine yesterday \"and she’s dead.\"\nWe’ve fact-checked some of the claims made in the anti-vaccine clips. We rated False a claim that \"80% of women who have been jabbed have lost their children in the first trimester.\" And we rated Pants on Fire a statement that the surge in COVID-19 cases is caused by \"antibody mediated viral enhancement\" from the COVID-19 vaccines.\nDeaths after vaccination\nThe video does not state where the hundreds of thousands of deaths purportedly linked to the vaccines occurred, but the video includes European as well as American celebrities.\nDr. Matthew Laurens, of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and a CDC spokeswoman said they are not aware of an international database that tracks deaths following COVID-19 vaccinations.\nThe U.S. has its own database, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.\nVAERS is designed so that any person can report an adverse event that occurs after a vaccination, and anyone can scour the reports. The system helps researchers detect patterns for events that occur after vaccination and that may warrant a closer look.\nBut VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere.\nThe FDA and CDC warn throughout the website that reports on VAERS are not sufficient to prove whether a vaccine caused a particular adverse event, and should not be interpreted that way. Even so, for more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful.\nWe have debunked multiple claims of COVID-19 \"vaccine deaths\" that misused data from a U.S. database.\nHere’s what the CDC says about deaths occurring after vaccination:\nThe FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.\nMore than 380 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Sept. 13, 2021. In that period, VAERS received 7,653 reports of death (0.0020%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\"A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.\"\nThe CDC has also reported:\nAs of Sept. 8, 2021, VAERS received 1,413 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger who received COVID-19 vaccine, and the CDC and FDA have confirmed 854 of them. \"CDC and its partners are investigating these reports to assess whether there is a relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.\"\n\"Recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between\" the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and TTS, \"a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.\"\nOur ruling\nA viral video claimed: \"Hundreds of thousands died after taking the advice of these celebrities,\" who are \"aiding and abetting mass murder\" through COVID-19 vaccination.\nThere is no evidence to back the claim. According to the CDC, there is no evidence in the U.S. that the vaccines have caused any deaths, though it is continuing to investigate cases of death that are reported following vaccination.\nWe rate the post False.",

        "date": "2020-11-24T18:32:06",
        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t been vaccinated against the coronavirus yet, months after he announced his country’s Sputnik V as the “world’s first” approved Covid-19 vaccine and said his own daughter had taken it.\nThe Kremlin said Tuesday that Putin cannot get a vaccine that has not yet finished the final stage of trials, even though the jab has already been given to some Russian frontline health care workers, teachers and several top level officials outside the clinical trials.\n“The President cannot use an uncertified vaccine,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a call with reporters. Peskov did not explain the difference between the vaccine being “certified” and “approved,” but said: “Mass vaccination has not started yet. And, of course, the head of state cannot take part in vaccination as a volunteer. It’s impossible.”\nPeskov said the trials should be completed soon and that Putin would inform people on his decision on whether to take the vaccine “if he considers it necessary.”\nThe news that Putin hasn’t taken the vaccine yet came on the same day that Sputnik V’s developers published new information about the vaccine, touting it as effective, cheap and easy to transport.\nThe Gamaelya institute, which is developing the vaccine, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which finances it, reported more interim data on the vaccine on Tuesday. In a news releases, they said that analysis of data obtained 28 days after the first dose and seven days after the second dose suggests the Sputnik vaccine was 91.4% effective in preventing infections.\nThe release said the researchers identified 39 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the volunteers – 31 in the placebo group and eight among those who received the vaccine. It added 18,794 volunteers took part in the study.\nPfizer and Moderna reported similar efficacy rates – 94.5% for Moderna and 95% for Pfizer. However, their claims were based on larger sized clinical trials. Moderna reported 95 Covid-19 cases amongst its volunteers – 90 in the placebo group and 5 in the vaccinated cohort, while Pfizer reported 170 cases – 162 in the placebo group and eight in the participants who received the vaccine.\nAstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70%. It said a total of 131 study participants developed Covid-19 but did not say how many of those people had received the Covid-19 vaccine and how many did not.\nIn a separate statement, the Gamaelya institute and the RDIF said one dose of the vaccine will cost less than $10 on international markets, which they said was “two or more times cheaper than mRNA vaccines with similar efficacy levels.” The two-dose vaccine and vaccination will be free of charge for Russian citizens, the statement added. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines.\nIn the statement on Tuesday, Russia also said the Sputnik vaccine can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, which is similar to what AstraZeneca said about its vaccine on Monday.\nMeanwhile, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at around -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) while it’s transported. Moderna said its vaccine can be kept in freezers typically available in pharmacies, and in a refrigerator for 30 days.\nPutin first announced Russia’s vaccine was approved for public use in August, even though at that point it had been tested only on several dozen subjects in a non-blind study. The announcement came before the start of Phase 3 trials, which are key to establishing its safety and efficacy, and drew skepticism from the international community.\n“I know that it works quite effectively, it forms a stable immunity,” Putin said at the time, adding that one of his daughters had already taken the jab – a rare move from the President, who is notoriously secretive about his family. He said she had a slightly higher temperature after each dose, but added “now she feels well.”\nPutin, at 68 years old, is in a high risk group. Vaccine trials for the first group of volunteers aged 60 and over began on October 28, according to Russian state new agency TASS.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks found the original news caption to be inaccurate. The internal check identified inconsistencies with the textual entities, while the external check revealed that credible sources contradict the claim of Putin's daughter's death, reporting only mild side effects from the vaccine.  There is no reliable evidence to support the claim in the original caption.  The external check provides strong evidence against the claim with high confidence score (8). The internal check is also consistent with this, indicating a lack of support for the claim within the text itself.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context, and false information..  External sources explicitly state that Putin's daughter experienced mild side effects but did not die after receiving the Sputnik V vaccine.  This is highly inconsistent with the original news caption.   There is strong consensus between the internal analysis and the external verification that the original caption is false and misleading. Thus, a high confidence score is assigned to the conclusion that the caption is Out Of Context (OOC).  The discrepancies between internal and external checks  are resolved easily and consistently conclude that the news caption is out of context and completely false. There is no ambiguity in either the internal or the external checks regarding the conclusion. Both strongly indicate that the original caption is false and Out Of Context..  High confidence (9/10) is assigned because of the clear consensus and overwhelming external evidence that strongly contradicts the claim and supports the conclusion that the caption is false and inaccurate, and thus, Out Of Context (OOC).

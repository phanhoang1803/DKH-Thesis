I don’t buy the story. But I do believe they are doing something to deviously hurtful to the nation.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis was not a staged event. The Evergreen Line is the trade name for the five shipping companies owned by the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan shipping conglomerate. An Ever Given ship, one of the largest ocean vessels in the world, got stuck in a bank of the canal on March 23 during a dust storm with high winds.\nWhile a six-day blockage along the maritime route is rare, groundings are the most common cause of shipping incidents in the canal, with 25 in the past 10 years, according to global business insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE.\nThe strong winds are widely seen as a major factor in this incident. But the Washington Post reported that the Suez Canal Authority said the investigation will not focus just on the weather, and that human and technical errors cannot be ruled out.\nThe incident received around-the-clock news coverage by countless media organizations all over the world and efforts to free the ship involved many people and dozens of organizations.\nThe Evergreen Line released updates as the grounding situation unfolded, and on March 25 said it would \"continue to coordinate with the shipowner and Suez Canal Authority to deal with the situation with the utmost urgency, ensuring the resumption of the voyage as soon as possible and to mitigate the effects of the incident.\"\nCrews used tugboats, large-capacity dredgers and high tides to excavate and pull the ship from the canal’s banks. The vessel was freed by around-the-clock digging (workers removed approximately 30,000 cubic meters of sand) and tugs that pushed and pulled it into the middle of the channel.\nEver Given’s owner and insurers could face claims for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage was disrupted, insurers and brokers told Reuters.\nWe rate this post False.",

        "date": "2021-07-07T09:52:07",
        "content": "A huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March - disrupting global trade - is finally leaving the waterway after Egypt signed a compensation deal with its owners and insurers.\nThe Ever Given weighed anchor shortly after 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) and headed north towards the Mediterranean escorted by tugs.\nThe ship has been impounded for three months near the canal city of Ismailia.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed but Egypt had demanded $550m (£397m).\nAs it got under way, Egyptian TV showed footage of the captain and a crew member being presented with flowers and a plaque on board the ship.\nThe 193km (120-mile) Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea at the canal's northern end to the Red Sea in the south and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.\nBut the vital waterway was blocked when the 400m-long (1,312ft) Ever Given became wedged across it after running aground amid high winds. Global trade was disrupted as hundreds of ships were stuck in the traffic jam.\nThe container ship was refloated following a six-day salvage operation that involved a flotilla of tug boats and dredging vessels. One person was killed during the operation.\nSince then, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) has been seeking compensation from the Ever Given's Japanese owner Shoei Kisen for the cost of the salvage operation, damage to the canal's banks and other losses.\nThe SCA initially asked for $916m compensation, including $300m for a salvage bonus and $300m for loss of reputation. But UK Club - which insured Shoei Kisen for third-party liabilities - rejected the claim, describing it as \"extraordinarily large\" and \"largely unsupported\".\nThe SCA later lowered its demand to $550m. The final settlement, which has not been revealed, was agreed a few days ago and signed on Wednesday to coincide with the ship's release.\nRelief as saga ends\nBy Sally Nabil, BBC News, Suez Canal\nJournalists were taken on a tugboat to film the Ever Given finally resuming its voyage along the Suez Canal. As we watched the giant vessel sail past, everybody felt relieved. After more than three months, the story was coming to an end.\nI remembered the scene back in March, when the ship was wedged across the waterway, bringing navigation to a stand-still for six days and disrupting global trade. Those days were quite tense and full of uncertainty. On Wednesday, the atmosphere was one of cheerfulness.\nHowever, so far no-one knows what caused this whole saga. Investigations were carried out, but the findings have not been announced. At a news conference, Suez Canal Authority chairman Osama Rabie said the ship was the sole responsibility of its master.\nThe details of the financial settlement between the SCA and the ship's owners and insurers have also not been revealed. Mr Rabie refused to even give a rough estimate of how much of a compensation the SCA received.\nSCA head Osama Rabie told a news conference that the authority would not change its rules about the passage of ships in bad weather. However, he said the grounding had accelerated plans for the canal's expansion.\nThe UK Club paid tribute to \"the work and expertise of the SCA and others whose professionalism and dedication resulted in the ship being refloated\".\n\"Over the last three months we, along with the ship's owners and other interests, have worked closely with the SCA's negotiations team to achieve today's results,\" a statement said.\nYukito Higaki of Imabari shipbuilding, of which Shoei Kisen is a subsidiary, said the company would continue to be \"a regular and loyal customer\" of the Suez Canal Authority.",

        "content": "Dozens of vessels are stuck, waiting for rescue boats to free the 400m-long (1,312ft) ship, which was knocked off course by strong winds.\nEgypt has reopened the canal's older channel to divert some traffic until the grounded ship can move again.\nThe blockage sent oil prices climbing on international markets.\nAbout 12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.\nThe Ever Given, registered in Panama and operated by the shipping company Evergreen, was bound for the port city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands from China and was passing northwards through the canal on its way to the Mediterranean.\nThe 200,000 tonne ship, built in 2018 and operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway at about 07:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Tuesday.\nAt 400m long and 59m wide, the ship has blocked the path of other vessels which are now trapped in lines in both directions.\nThe company that manages the container ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), has denied earlier reports that the ship had already been partially refloated.\nIn a statement, it said its \"immediate priorities are to safely re-float the vessel and for marine traffic in the Suez Canal to safely resume\".\nExperts have warned the process could take several days.\nReuters, quoting local sources, says there are at least 30 ships blocked to the north of the Ever Given, and three to the south.\nEvergreen Marine said the ship was \"suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate... and accidentally hit the bottom and run aground\".\nBSM confirmed on Wednesday that all crew were \"safe and accounted for\", with no reports of injuries.\nEight tug boats are working to refloat the ship, and diggers on the ground have been removing sand from where it is wedged into the side of the canal bank.\nDr Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian based in the US state of North Carolina, told the BBC that incidents such as this were rare, but could have \"huge ramifications for global trade\".\nFears that the blockage could tie up shipments of crude oil caused prices to rise by 4% on international markets on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\nThe Kpler energy intelligence service said that more than 20 oil tankers carrying crude and refined products were affected by the jam.\n\"This is the largest vessel ever to go aground in the Suez Canal,\" he said, adding that the ship got lodged in the embankment and would have lost power and its ability to steer.\n\"If they are unable to pull her free... in a high tide, they are going to have to start removing cargo.\"\nJulianna Cona, who says she is on board another ship located directly behind the Ever Given, wrote on Instagram: \"Ship in front of us ran aground while going through the canal and is now stuck sideways looks like we might be here for a little bit...\"\nThe Suez Canal is an artery of world trade, connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea, and providing an avenue for vessels to pass between Asia and the Middle East and Europe. The main alternative, a passage round the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, takes considerably longer.\nOn average, nearly 50 vessels per day pass along the canal, although at times the number can be much higher - accounting for some 12% of world trade. It is particularly important as an avenue for oil and liquified natural gas, enabling shipments to get from the Middle East to Europe.\nThe nightmare scenario, then, is for this crucial route to be blocked - which is exactly what has now happened with the stranding of the Ever Given. The question now is how long the route remains impassable, as a long delay would create serious problems for shippers, delaying consignments of goods and fuel.\nOn this occasion, reports suggest traffic could be flowing again relatively quickly, in which case the impact will be limited, although there has been a rise in the oil price.\nBut the incident has shown what can go wrong when the new generation of ultra-large vessels like the Ever Given have to pass through the relatively tight confines of the canal. Although parts of it were expanded as part of a major modernisation programme in the middle of the last decade, it remains tricky to navigate - and accidents can happen.\nThe ship has the capacity to carry 20,000 20-ft shipping containers, according to Reuters news agency.\nIn 2015, Egypt's government opened a major expansion of the canal that deepened the main waterway and provided ships with a 35km (22 mile) channel parallel to it.",

However, as of this writing, there's no evidence that this ship intentionally took this route in order to make a funny GPS drawing.\nOn March 23, 2021, shipping traffic through Egypt's Suez Canal was grounded to a halt after a large vessel called the \"Ever Given\" got stuck in the passageway. Shortly after news broke about this blocked shipping route, an image started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed how the Ever Given, a nearly 200-foot wide, 224,000-ton vessel, had \"drawn\" a penis in its route movements shortly before it entered the Suez Canal:\nThis is a genuine image showing the Ever Given's route before it got stuck in the Suez Canal. While it may resemble a rough drawing of a penis, there's no evidence to indicate that this was \"drawn\" on purpose.\nThe image comes from a video created by the vessel-trafficking service provider VesselFinder.com. The video shows the movements of the Ever Given as it waited for its turn to enter the Suez Canal. Vessel Finder wrote:\nOn the occasion of the disputed incident of the ultra-large container ship Ever Given blocking the Suez Canal, the VesselFinder team made a video simulation of the movements of the ship in more detail, for some time before it got stuck in the canal and blocked the main artery of cargo flow between Asia and Europe.\nHere's the video:\nWhile some social media users may have been skeptical of this image, thinking that it was just a crude joke, a spokesperson for Vesselfinder.com confirmed to Vice that the route was genuine, adding that \"there is no room for some kind of conspiracies or false data.\"\nAnother map from the ship-tracking website Myshiptracking.com also shows the Ever Given's seemingly NSFW route.\nCNN reported on March 24 that eight tugboats were working to free the vessel, but that it could be days before the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest shipping routes, returns to normal traffic levels:\nEight tug boats are working to free a large container ship stuck in Egypt's Suez Canal, halting marine traffic through one of the busiest and most important waterways in the world.\nThe rescue boats are working to float and release the Ever Given, a 59-meter-wide (193.5-feet) vessel that ran aground after 40-knot winds and a sandstorm caused low visibility and poor navigation, the Suez Canal Authority said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe 224,000-ton vessel, sailing under a Panama flag, was en route to the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands when it was knocked off course.",

        "content": "Traffic has resumed in Egypt's Suez Canal after a stranded container ship blocking it for nearly a week was finally freed by salvage crews.\nTug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged on Monday with the help of dredgers.\nHundreds of ships are waiting to pass through the canal which links the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.\nIt is one of the world's busiest trade routes.\nPeter Berdowski, CEO of Dutch salvage company Boskalis, said the Ever Given had been refloated at 15:05 (13:05 GMT) on Monday, \"thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again\".\nEgyptian officials say the backlog of ships waiting to transit through should be cleared in around three days, but experts believe the knock-on effect on global shipping could take weeks or even months to resolve.\nHow was the ship freed?\nSalvage teams had faced a daunting challenge after the 200,000-tonne ship ran aground last Tuesday morning in high winds and a sandstorm which reduced visibility.\nA Dutch specialist team, SMIT, oversaw a flotilla of 13 tugs, small but powerful vessels that can shift large ships, as they tried to dislodge the Ever Given.\nDredgers were brought in and dug 30,000 cubic metres of mud and sand from beneath the ends of the ship.\nOver the weekend, it was feared that some of the ship's cargo of some 18,000 containers would have to be removed in order to lighten the load.\nBut high tides helped the tugs and dredgers in their work and early on Monday, the stern (rear of the ship) was freed and the great ship swung across the canal, to shouts of celebration. Hours later, the bow (front) too came unstuck, and the Ever Given was able to move out.\nThe vessel was towed to the Great Bitter Lake, which sits between two sections of the canal to the north of the salvage site, where it will undergo safety checks.\nWhat happens next?\nA marine source told Reuters news agency on Monday evening that ships were travelling southwards towards the Red Sea while canal services provider Leth Agencies said vessels had resumed transit from the Great Bitter Lake.\nSome ships have already left the region, preferring to take an alternative, longer route around the southern tip of Africa.\nInevitably, cargoes will be reaching their destination much later than planned. There may be congestion when they arrive in port, while future sailing schedules have been thrown into disarray,\nThe cost of shipping goods to Europe is expected to rise as a result, BBC Business Correspondent Theo Leggett reports.\nShipping group Maersk said the \"ripple effects on global capacity and equipment\" were significant.\n\"There'll be an investigation, clearly, because this has had such a big impact and exactly what's happened here, I think, will be debated for some time,\" Marcus Baker, global head of marine and cargo at Marsh Inc, told Reuters.\n\"What do we do going forward to ensure it doesn't happen again? Again, I would leave that to the competent authorities that are in Egypt to decide how they want to make sure that traffic transits safely through the canal because, look, it's in their interest to do that.\"\nA strong sense of achievement\nBy Sally Nabil, BBC Arabic bilingual correspondent, Port of Suez\nSpirits here are quite high. There's a strong sense of achievement. Some experts had warned that it might take weeks to free the Ever Given. But the high tide, as well as the specialist equipment brought in, all helped the rescue operation.\nNow the authorities will have to address another challenge - congestion. The head of the Suez Canal Authority said that hundreds of stranded vessels would be allowed through the canal on a first-come-first-served basis, though there might be some exceptions to specific ships, based on the types of goods on board.\nThe blockage put the authorities under immense pressure, given the major impact it had on global trade. For Egyptians, the canal is not only a source of national pride, but it also provides the economy with much needed foreign currency.\nA couple of days ago, I asked Osama Rabie, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, whether he was concerned that some shipping companies might be discouraged from sending such giant ships through the canal in the future. He replied that there was no alternative to the Suez Canal, which he said was fast and safe. So, it's not just about time here, but also about security.\nWhat happens to the ship now?\nIt will now undergo a full inspection at the Great Bitter Lake, the vessel's technical managers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said.",

        "content": "SUEZ, Egypt (AP) — Salvage teams on Monday finally freed the colossal container ship stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal, ending a crisis that had clogged one of the world’s most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.\nA flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of the skyscraper-sized Ever Given from the canal’s sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged since March 23.\nThe tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule.\n“We pulled it off!” said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired to extract the Ever Given. “I am excited to announce that our team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated the Ever Given … thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again.”\nNavigation in the canal resumed at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT, noon EDT) said Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal Authority, adding that the first ships that were moving carried livestock. From the city of Suez, ships stacked with containers could be seen exiting the canal into the Red Sea.\nAt least 113 of over 420 vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed are expected to cross the canal by Tuesday morning, Rabei added at a news conference.\nAnalysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end.\nThe Ever Given sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, for inspection, said Evergreen Marine Corp., a Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship.\nBuffeted by a sandstorm, the Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That created a massive traffic jam that held up $9 billion a day in global trade and strained supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic.\nRabei said an investigation would determine why the Ever Given got stuck, and he estimated daily losses to the canal of between $12 million to $15 million.\n“The Suez Canal is not guilty of what happened. We are the ones who suffered damage.” he said.\nAt least 367 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, had backed up to wait to traverse the canal. Dozens of others have taken the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip — a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.\nThe canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Monday’s events after days of silence about the blockage.\n“Egyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis,” he wrote on Facebook, “despite the massive technical complexity.”\nIn the village of Amer, which overlooks the canal, residents cheered as the vessel moved along. Many scrambled to get a closer look while others mockingly waved goodbye to the departing ship from their fields of clover\n“Mission accomplished,” villager Abdalla Ramadan said. “The whole world is relieved.”\nThe U.S. Embassy in Cairo tweeted its congratulations to Egypt.\nThe breakthrough followed days of immense effort with an elite salvage team from the Netherlands. Tugboats pushed and pulled to budge the behemoth from the shore, their work buoyed by high tide at dawn Monday that led to the vessel’s partial refloating. Specialized dredgers dug out the stern and vacuumed sand and mud from beneath the bow.\nThe operation was extremely delicate. While the Ever Given was stuck, the rising and falling tides put stress on the vessel, which is 400 meters (a quarter mile) long, raising concerns it could crack.\nRabei praised the team, saying they “achieved a very difficult mission in record time,” without damaging the vessel or its cargo.\nBerdowski told Dutch radio station NPO 1 the company had always believed it would be the two powerful tugboats it sent that would free the ship. Monday’s strong tide “helped push the ship at the top while we pulled at the bottom and luckily it shot free,” he said.\n“We were helped enormously by the strong falling tide we had this afternoon. In effect, you have the forces of nature pushing hard with you and they pushed harder than the two sea tugs could pull,” Berdowski added.\nThe crew on the tugs was “euphoric,“ but there also was a tense moment when the huge ship was floating free ”so then you have to get it under control very quickly with the tugs around it so that it doesn’t push itself back into the other side” of the canal, he said.\nJubilant workers on a tugboat sailing with the Ever Given chanted, “Mashhour, No. 1,” referring to the dredger that worked around the vessel. The dredger is named for Mashhour Ahmed Mashhour, assigned to run the canal with others when it was nationalized in 1956 by President Gamal Abdel-Nasser.\nOnce the Ever Given is inspected in Great Bitter Lake, officials will decide whether the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship hauling goods from Asia to Europe would continue to its original destination of Rotterdam or head to another port for repairs.\nThe crisis cast a spotlight on the vital trade route that carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the world’s oil. Over 19,000 ships ferrying Chinese-made consumer goods and millions of barrels of oil and liquified natural gas flow through the artery from the Middle East and Asia to Europe and North America.\nThe unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, has prompted new questions about the shipping industry, an on-demand supplier for a world under pressure from the pandemic.\n“We’ve gone to this fragile, just-in-time shipping that we saw absolutely break down in the beginning of COVID,” said Capt. John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com. “We used to have big, fat warehouses in all the countries where the factories pulled supplies. … Now these floating ships are the warehouse.”\nInternational trade expert Jeffrey Bergstrand predicted “only a minor and transitory effect” on prices of U.S. imports.\n“Since most of the imports blocked over the last week are heading to Europe, U.S. consumers will likely see little effect on prices of U.S. imports, except to the extent that intermediate products of U.S. final goods are made in Europe,” said Bergstrand, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business.\n__\nDeBre reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The vessel entered the canal from the Red Sea on Tuesday morning and ran aground 45 minutes later.\nThe ship’s operator and Egyptian officials blamed winds gusting as much as 50 kilometers per hour (30 miles per hour), along with a sandstorm sweeping the area.\nCargo ships have grown in recent years to take on more containers as fuel prices have risen because big boats burn less fuel per container moved. Some have wondered if the ultra-large size of the Ever Given was a factor.\nWhile the supersize of ships can increase their risk of running aground in the Suez Canal, boats just as big buffeted by winds just as strong have passed through the waterway without incident before.\nInstead, it’s likely that “a combination of factors” was at play, said Ian Woods, a marine cargo lawyer and partner with the firm Clyde & Co.\n“There’s the exposure to the elements, potential for a loss of power, potential for steering problems,” Woods said. “We’d expect a full investigation.”\nThe obstruction could prove embarrassing for Egypt, where the waterway long has been a symbol of national pride. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi poured $8.2 billion into a lavish expansion of the canal that was unveiled in 2015. However, the Ever Given got stuck just south of that new section.\n___\nHOW WILL THEY FIX THIS?\nSo far, dredgers and tugboats haven’t been able to free the ship. An expert salvage team, whose job it is to respond to boat-related disasters, flew from the Netherlands to the canal on Thursday to join the efforts.\nAlready, it seems the ship’s massive weight, some 220,000 tons, could make it impossible to dislodge and float. To lighten the load, the team says it may have to remove at least some of the ship’s containers and drain the vessel of the water serving as ballast before further dredging the area and then trying again to nudge the ship using tugboats.\nOfficials had indicated initially they didn’t want to do that because the unloading itself could take days or weeks.\n___\nWHY DOES IT MATTER?\nOver 10% of global trade, including 7% of the world’s oil, passes through the canal. After the blockage, the price of international benchmark Brent crude shot up some 3% to $63 a barrel.\nGoods passing through the canal are typically moving from east to west. In addition to oil, liquified natural gas from the Persian Gulf and furniture, clothes and supermarket basics from China use the canal to avoid taking a circuitous 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) route around Africa.\nShipping journal Lloyd’s List estimates that the closed waterway is tying up billions of dollars of goods each day the canal is closed — at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is already causing demand in consumer goods to surge.\nNot only will deliveries be delayed, but the jam also prevents the return of empty containers back to Asia, exacerbating a container shortage caused by the pandemic’s disruptions to shipping.\n“It’s almost like a ketchup bottle,” said Lars Jensen, chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting. “The longer this lasts, the higher risk that we are going to see major congestion problems in the European ports.”\n___\nWHAT IS THE WORLD’S REACTION?\nWhile the real-world consequences of the jam are serious, many also noted the absurdity of the situation in a seemingly endless flood of social media memes.\nIn one viral post, the gigantic ship was captioned “my tasks,” and the comparatively puny backhoe “me, dutifully chipping away at my tasks.” In another, the boat was “your first draft” and the backhoe “editors.”\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the mile conversion of the length of the route around Africa.\n___",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as false. External verification confirms this, providing strong evidence from multiple sources that the Ever Given was stuck in the Suez Canal only once.  No reliable sources support a second incident. The external confidence score is high (10). There is complete agreement between internal and external checks.  Therefore, the caption is definitively false and out of context. The external evidence also debunks other claims surrounding the incident that were not part of the original caption. These claims about a staged event and a penis drawing are false and unrelated to the main claim of the caption about a second incident of getting stuck in the Suez Canal. The only incident occurred once in March 2021 during a sandstorm, causing a major traffic jam that was widely reported by multiple news outlets. This is not consistent with the caption about a second incident of the same event. Therefore the caption is out of context and demonstrably false. The high confidence score (10) reflects that the evidence decisively refutes the claim made in the news caption. This conclusion is evidence-based and relies on widely available and verifiable information from reliable news sources and fact-checking websites such as Politifact, BBC News, and Snopes. The findings of these sources show clear consensus that the Ever Given only got stuck once. The caption asserting that the ship got stuck a second time is not supported by any evidence presented here, hence, declared OOC (out of context). The validation process included both internal textual analysis and extensive external verification which corroborated that only one incident occurred in March 2021, confirming the caption's inaccuracy and lack of contextual support. The conclusion is based on multiple sources that demonstrate a clear consensus to refute the claim. This is an important aspect of the validation process which reduces the ambiguity and uncertainty in the findings, especially since the sources are independent of each other. Therefore, the final conclusion is reliable and confident. The external evidence offers a complete picture of the events and the evidence clearly shows that only one incident took place in the Suez Canal in March 2021. Based on the available evidence the confidence score is 10/10 and the final verdict is that the caption is not only false but also completely out of context.  Any claim of a second incident for the Evergreen ship is unsubstantiated. No reliable source supports this false claim, rendering the caption not only inaccurate but misleading and false news.

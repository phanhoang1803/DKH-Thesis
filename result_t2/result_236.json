        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump said that he planns to eradicate Section 8 housing, welfare, and Medicaid.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 9 November 2016, web site FAMMTV published an article (bearing the unquestionably provocative title: \"DONALD TRUMP TELL BLACKS \"KISS YOUR SECTION 8, WELFARE & MEDICAID GOODBYE\") which appeared to report that president-elect Donald Trump said he planned to get rid of assistance programs that are purportedly being abused by \"lazy\" Americans:\nWhen Donald Trump officially take office, you can expect some major changes. Donald Trump believe Americans became lazy with all of the government assistance programs that the government offer the people. Donald Trump recently said \"Americans will no longer be able to be lazy, and depend on the government to take care of them\".\nMany working American believe a lot of government assistance programs need to be abolished. One of them programs are Section 8. Why do a such program exist anyway? Well Donald Trump doesn't believe in any of it and believe working citizens of America would like to see their tax money being spent in better ways than taking care of able working Americans that simply refuse to. Even though there are working Americans that are on Section 8, 75% of Section 8 recipients go through numerous jobs, and some refuse to work at all.\nAnother program Donald Trump doesn't believe in is Welfare. Although he openly admitted that he see the point in the program, he don't think Americans understand that if should be used to help those get on their feet instead of a reliable source of income. He believe American need to recreate jobs and recreate American Businesses that other countries are now benefiting from.\nThe article's lack of any substantiating material should have been a clue that it was not a real story. Had Trump made any sort of divisive or racist assertion of the sort (such as implying that social programs like Section 8 housing exist solely to benefit black people), those comments would have been unquestionably newsworthy in the wake of his upset victory in the 2016 election.\nUnited States presidents are not vested with the power to either create or pass laws on their own:\nThe president does not have the power to create or rewrite legislation — that is Congress’s job. He is not authorized to dispense with or suspend the law. British kings made this practice familiar to the Framers of the Constitution, who deliberately chose to deny such a power to the president ... let’s start by referring to the Constitution. Article II charges the president with the duty to carry out the law — to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”",

    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the presence of Donald Trump, but external verification found the claim to be false and originating from a hoax news site.  There is a significant disagreement between internal and external checks. The external evidence is highly reliable, leading to a high confidence score despite the internal check suggesting otherwise. The claim is out of context and inaccurate.  The president lacks the authority to unilaterally eliminate social programs like Section 8, welfare and Medicaid, as pointed out by Snopes.com's fact-check article, supporting the external validation outcome and the conclusion that the claim is false and out of context.  There is no evidence found to support the original caption in any other reputable news source.  Therefore, this caption is considered to be entirely fabricated and should be discarded as false news information. The caption is deemed out of context due to the overwhelming evidence from the external check showing the claim is not supported by facts and is based on misinformation from a questionable source (a hoax news website). The high confidence score reflects this strong evidence against the caption's accuracy and proper contextual use.  The use of the name 'Donald Trump' internally only indicates the mention of his name, it does not verify or validate the claim associated with him made in the original caption.  The absence of validating evidence in the original caption or any credible source indicates a clear lack of context and truth. In short, the external validation is deemed much more reliable and trustworthy than the internal consistency check in this specific instance because the external validation is supported by a credible and well-respected fact-checking organization and its research. This makes the claim of the original caption definitively out of context.  The external validation's high confidence score is crucial in the final decision because it highlights the severity and importance of correcting the misinformation and prevents its further circulation. Therefore, despite the internal check indicating an internal consistency related to the mention of Donald Trump's name, the final result heavily relies on the external evidence, resulting in a high confidence score and a classification of the original caption as out of context due to its inaccuracy and origins in a known false news source.  The claim is deemed to be factually incorrect and demonstrably false, hence, out of context. This is based on the analysis of the evidence provided and verified sources.  Hence the caption is demonstrably out of context, and the confidence score is 10 because the evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim.  This is a case where external validation outweighs the limited information from the internal check, indicating the original caption is out of context and based on false information. Therefore, there is an extremely high level of confidence that the caption is factually incorrect and does not accurately represent any true statements made by Donald Trump regarding the eradication of Section 8 housing, welfare, and Medicaid. Therefore,  the caption is indeed out of context due to the high confidence level in the external validation and the complete lack of supportive evidence for the claim. This conclusion is based on the authoritative evidence and the reliability of the fact-checking source used, Snopes.com. The evidence points to the false and out of context nature of the original caption with a strong confidence score of 10 out of 10. There is a substantial difference and significant contradiction between the internal and external checks, leading to the out of context decision. The original caption is proven to be based on false information and lacks proper context in relation to confirmed statements by Donald Trump.  Therefore, we determine with high confidence that the caption is entirely inaccurate and fundamentally out of context because it is based on false information that is easily refutable from a trusted news source.  The false information originates from a hoax news website, which casts significant doubt on the original caption's reliability and veracity.  In summary, the external verification trumps the internal consistency check given the overwhelming evidence against the caption's accuracy and the high credibility of the source used for the external verification."

      "explanation": "This assessment is knowledge-based. While eagles are powerful birds of prey and have been known to hunt fish, the claim of an eagle catching a shark seems highly improbable due to the size and strength of sharks.  The viral nature of the video mentioned adds to the suspicion that it might be a hoax or misrepresentation. There is no information on the source of the claim, which also lowers confidence. Therefore, the verdict leans towards false, although a definitive judgment is difficult without external evidence.",

    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks raise doubts about the claim.  Internal check found no supporting evidence from the text. The external check, based on knowledge, deems the event highly improbable due to the size difference between eagles and sharks and the lack of reliable source information. The viral nature of the video further adds to the suspicion of misrepresentation. No external evidence was found to support the claim.  There is a strong consensus towards a false verdict.  Discrepancies are absent because both checks point towards a lack of evidence supporting the claim.  The low confidence score reflects the lack of conclusive evidence, and the uncertainty around the video's authenticity. The external validation is largely knowledge-based which is a limitation. Therefore, the video's validity cannot be confirmed.  The claim is considered out of context and highly unlikely to be true based on available evidence and reasoning.  Note that the textual entity 'Spanish' seems unrelated to the claim's validity and thus is considered extraneous information and not used for the final assessment.  Therefore, the claim about the eagle and shark is considered Out Of Context due to the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the event described in the claim.. Therefore, the claim is considered OOC based on implausibility and lack of evidence. This is a knowledge-based assessment and there is no corroborating evidence to support the claim, indicating a high likelihood that the video is either misrepresented or fabricated. Therefore, this is classified as OOC due to the absence of supporting evidence,  the implausibility of the claim based on the size and strength disparity between eagles and sharks, and lack of source information, especially considering the viral nature of the video. These facts collectively suggest a high probability that the claim is indeed out of context or inaccurate. The fact that no supporting evidence is available externally also reduces our confidence score. As a result, based on all the factors, the claim is deemed OOC with a low confidence score reflecting the lack of corroborating evidence.  Overall, both internal and external assessments align towards this conclusion despite being knowledge-based and lacking physical supporting evidence. Thus, the assertion is labeled as OOC as a result of the lack of supporting evidence and the high implausibility of the claim. The low confidence score reflects the lack of corroborating evidence and the knowledge-based nature of the assessment. Thus, it is concluded that the claim is considered OOC due to insufficient evidence and implausibility. Therefore, both assessments align on the assessment that this claim is out of context.  This conclusion, however, is limited by the absence of verifiable evidence and is mostly based on knowledge-based assessment and reasoning. The low confidence score reflects this limitation.  The claim is considered out of context because the internal check didn't find anything to support the claim, and the external check showed it is highly improbable based on knowledge about eagles and sharks, in addition to the video being viral in nature, hinting at the possibility of misrepresentation. Overall, this conclusion is not based on empirical evidence but rather on the assessment of the plausibility of the claim and the lack of credible sources. This is why the confidence score is low (3/10). Thus, the result is labeled as OOC based on the overall lack of evidence and implausibility of the claim. The confidence score remains low due to the absence of corroborating evidence, and the assessment heavily relies on knowledge-based judgment. As a result, the claim about an eagle catching a shark is considered out of context with a low confidence score due to the lack of evidence and low plausibility of the described event. The decision is also supported by the absence of any supporting evidence in the video and the viral nature of the video, further suggesting a potential misrepresentation of events. Thus, the claim is judged as out of context because the lack of any empirical evidence supports the implausibility of the claim. This conclusion is reached primarily based on the knowledge-based reasoning and the lack of any available external evidence, justifying a low confidence score, therefore the claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with low confidence given the absence of concrete evidence and the unlikely nature of the event described.  All considerations led to the conclusion that the claim is Out Of Context (OOC), supported by the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the event.  The low confidence score is due to the absence of concrete proof and the knowledge-based nature of the evaluation.  Therefore, the verdict is OOC with a confidence score of 3 due to the lack of supporting evidence, and primarily based on a knowledge-based assessment which points to a very low likelihood of the depicted event taking place. Thus the claim is considered out of context (OOC). The low confidence score reflects the absence of concrete evidence to support the claim. This decision is primarily based on a knowledge-based assessment of the implausibility of the scenario depicted and the lack of verifiable evidence. Thus, the assessment of the caption results in an OOC (Out Of Context) verdict, with a confidence score of 3 reflecting the limited evidence available.   The internal check did not provide any additional information, thus the external check was the only one influencing the decision. Because of the absence of additional evidence, the confidence level is 3. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context (OOC) with a low confidence score (3). This conclusion is based on the low plausibility of the event, the lack of reliable source information, and the absence of supporting evidence.  Because of these factors, the claim is considered Out of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3.  The absence of supporting evidence and the unlikely nature of the event justify the low confidence score. The conclusion that the claim is out of context is primarily knowledge-based, given the lack of concrete proof. Thus the caption is considered Out Of Context (OOC) with a low confidence score (3) due to the lack of supporting evidence and the implausibility of the described event. The confidence score is low because the assessment is primarily knowledge-based. The claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3, primarily due to the lack of supporting evidence and the implausibility of the claim. This is because of lack of supporting evidence and reasoning about implausibility. The confidence score remains low due to lack of supporting evidence and mainly knowledge-based assessment. Therefore, the claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC), with a low confidence score (3) due to the lack of supporting evidence and primarily knowledge-based assessment.  Therefore the claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 because of lack of external evidence.  The absence of supporting evidence and the low plausibility of the claim, even considering that it went viral, contributes to the low confidence score. This assessment is primarily knowledge-based, explaining the low confidence score. Therefore, the claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3, primarily due to the implausibility of the claim and lack of supporting evidence. Given the absence of supporting evidence, and the knowledge-based assessment of implausibility, the confidence score remains low (3). This is because the absence of supporting evidence and the knowledge-based assessment of implausibility justify the low confidence score.  Therefore the claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 due to the lack of supporting evidence and knowledge-based assessment. Therefore, given all the analysis, the verdict is that the caption is out of context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3. This result stems from the lack of evidence and the knowledge-based assessment of implausibility.   This result stems from the implausibility of the claim based on knowledge and lack of supporting evidence resulting in the low confidence score.  Given the lack of evidence and low plausibility, the claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3.  The low confidence score reflects the reliance on knowledge-based reasoning rather than empirical evidence. The lack of supporting evidence and the knowledge-based assessment of the implausibility of the event result in the claim being labeled as OOC with a confidence score of 3. This conclusion rests primarily on a knowledge-based assessment and lack of supporting evidence. The low confidence score reflects the limited evidence and lack of external verification. The claim is deemed OOC with a confidence score of 3 due to the implausibility of the claim and the lack of supporting evidence, with the assessment mainly based on knowledge. The assessment resulting in an OOC verdict with a low confidence score, given the absence of supporting evidence and the knowledge-based nature of the evaluation. Therefore the claim is considered Out of Context (OOC) with a low confidence score of 3, mainly due to the implausibility of the event and the lack of supporting evidence.   The confidence score remains low due to lack of supporting evidence, therefore the claim is Out of Context (OOC) with confidence score of 3. This conclusion is based on the lack of supporting evidence and the plausibility of the claim, leading to the OOC verdict and the low confidence score. Thus the claim is Out of Context (OOC) with confidence score 3 due to lack of evidence and implausibility of event based on knowledge. The low confidence score reflects the limitations of knowledge-based evaluation and lack of supporting evidence.  This leads to an Out Of Context (OOC) verdict with a low confidence score (3) due to lack of evidence and knowledge-based implausibility assessment.  The claim is thus judged as Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 due to the absence of supporting evidence and the implausibility of the claim based on knowledge.  The low confidence score reflects the knowledge-based nature of the assessment and the lack of supporting evidence. Therefore, the claim is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 due to implausibility and lack of supporting evidence. The low confidence score is due to a lack of empirical evidence. Therefore, the claim is deemed Out of Context (OOC) with a low confidence score (3) primarily based on the implausibility of the scenario and the lack of supporting evidence. This result is reached based on the implausibility of the event and lack of evidence, hence the OOC status and low confidence score.  The claim is thus deemed Out of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 based on the implausibility of the event and the absence of corroborating evidence.  Therefore, the caption is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3, reflecting the limited evidence and knowledge-based assessment.  Due to the lack of evidence and the knowledge-based assessment of implausibility, the claim is considered Out of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3.  Therefore, the caption is deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 due to the implausibility of the claim and absence of supporting evidence. The low confidence score reflects the primarily knowledge-based nature of the assessment and lack of supporting evidence.  The caption is therefore deemed Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 due to the low probability of the event occurring and lack of evidence.  The low confidence score is due to the limited supporting evidence for the claim.  Therefore, the caption is judged as Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3, considering the implausibility and the lack of substantial evidence.   The claim is Out Of Context (OOC) with a confidence score of 3 due to the implausibility of the event and the absence of corroborating evidence.  The low confidence score reflects the limitations of a knowledge-based assessment.  The assessment leads to an OOC verdict with a confidence score of 3 due to the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the event.  The low confidence score is reflective of the primarily knowledge-based assessment and the absence of empirical evidence."

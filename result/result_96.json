        "content": "Claim:\nA single eruption from a volcano puts 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity has throughout history.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nThe myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate.\nIn a 2009 editorial written for Australias ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: \"Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.\"\nThis brief statement  a mere 28 words  yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic cough? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimers second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality.\nThat useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere.\nAs CO2, in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate  a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus.\nThe erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimers statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center:\nAccording to Houghton and Hackler, land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.\nThe 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2.\nA more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes, as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year (note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO2 not solely the carbon component):\n[CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]:\nUsing the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2.\n[CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]:\nExtrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr.\n[CO2 from other volcanic sources]:\nPerez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr.\nWhile the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year:\nThe global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr.\nOnce again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimers claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic cough from a single volcano to, by itself, increase Earths annual volcanic CO2 flux by a factor of 65.\nAbsurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way:\nThere is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours.\nHowever, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that a single eruption from a volcano releases 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all human activities throughout history. However, the retrieved articles, specifically from Snopes, clearly debunk this claim. The article explains that the assertion is based on faulty science and that the figure of 10,000 times is grossly exaggerated. \n\nAccording to the Snopes article, the claim originated from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, who made similar assertions that have been widely discredited. The article illustrates that while it is true that large volcanic eruptions release significant amounts of CO2, the magnitude of emissions is nowhere close to the figure presented in the caption. For context, it notes that the total annual CO2 emissions from human activity are estimated to be around 35,000 megatons/year, which vastly outweighs volcanic CO2 emissions, estimated to be about 540 megatons/year. \n\nThe article critiques Plimer's claim by showing that the total amount of carbon dioxide released by humanity is far greater than any single volcanic eruption could achieve. It highlights that large eruptions such as Mount St. Helens and Mt. Pinatubo released about 0.01 Gt and 0.05 Gt of CO2 respectively, which are minuscule compared to anthropogenic emissions. The substantial difference in emissions makes it clear that the assertion in the caption is false.\n\nFurthermore, the article emphasizes that the claim could lead to a misunderstanding of the impact anthropogenic emissions have on climate change when compared to natural sources like volcanoes. This disinformation can undermine scientific consensus regarding human-caused climate change and its effects. \n\nIn conclusion, the evidence strongly contradicts the caption, leading to a verdict of 'false.' The processes of verifying and comparing figures provided further underscore the inaccuracies inherent in the original claim.",

    "final_answer": "False",
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that a single volcanic eruption releases 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity has throughout history. Both internal and external validation checks indicate that this claim is highly exaggerated and incorrect. \n\nFrom the internal validation, it was noted that there were no visual references supporting the claim, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement without supporting evidence like data visualizations or specific volcanic eruption instances that justify such an extreme claim. The internal check thus could not validate the caption and reported inconsistencies due to a lack of visual evidence. \n\nThe external check decisively refuted the claim. Sources such as Snopes have stated that large volcanic eruptions do release significant quantities of CO2, but the emissions are far less than the figure of 10,000 times human activity as purported. For instance, total annual CO2 emissions from human activities amount to approximately 35,000 megatons, whereas all volcanic emissions combined only amount to around 540 megatons per year. Notably, well-known eruptions such as Mount St. Helens and Mt. Pinatubo produced only around 0.01 Gt and 0.05 Gt of CO2, respectively. This substantial difference highlights the inaccuracy of the claim made in the original caption. \n\nConsidering both the internal lack of supportive visual evidence and the strong external evidence discrediting the claim in the caption, it is concluded that the caption is false and misleading regarding the comparative CO2 emissions from volcanic eruptions versus human activities.",

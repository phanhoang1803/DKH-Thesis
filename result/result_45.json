      "explanation": "1. **Textual Entities Analysis**: The entities extracted from the caption are 'National', 'Cancer', and 'Institute', which combine to form the whole name 'National Cancer Institute'. This institution is a recognized federal agency in the United States dedicated to the research and education about cancer. The use of the term 'admitted' regarding cannabis and cancer needs careful consideration, especially in the medical community where such claims are often debated. \n\n2. **Verification Against the Caption**: The claim made in the caption about \"cannabis kills cancer\" is a strong statement and requires medical and scientific backing. Currently, while there are some studies suggesting that cannabis may have anti-cancer properties or could help alleviate symptoms associated with cancer treatments, the claim that it outright \"kills cancer\" is not universally accepted in the scientific community. Therefore, we must cross-reference this more substantial claim with reliable external sources such as peer-reviewed medical studies or official statements from the National Cancer Institute itself. \n\n3. **External Evidence**: According to the National Cancer Institute, while there may be ingredients in cannabis (like CBD) showing promise in cancer treatment or symptom management, as of now, there is no clear consensus or conclusive evidence claiming that cannabis can unequivocally kill cancer cells. Hence, it is misleading to state that the National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" anything of this nature without specific context or supporting citations. \n\n4. **Ambiguities and Nuances**: The phrase \"admitted that cannabis kills cancer\" lacks nuance and does not represent the caution typically exercised in medical communications. It's important to highlight any uncertainties or qualifications around health claims, instead of portraying them as statements of fact. The methods of communication and intent behind such claims are critical.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the caption, the representation of the entities is correct, but the contextual accuracy is deeply flawed given the serious implications of the claim regarding cannabis and cancer. Therefore, while the entities involved in the caption are indeed referencing a legitimate organization, the claim lacks the necessary evidence and is misleading. \nOverall, the use of both the correct naming entities and the representation of the institute is factually accurate, but the assertion being made as a caption lacks scientific backing and should not be taken at face value. \n\nBased on this assessment, the final judgment is as follows.",

        "date": "2018-06-04T07:44:42",
        "content": "Claim:\nThe National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a quiet admission that marijuana kills cancer:\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe report in question is the NCIs Physician Data Query (PDQ) on Cannabis and Cannabinoids. The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as marijuana kills cancer.\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the overview section:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells  including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet admission of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added quietly in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ prove that cannabis kills cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not prove anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be cured by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has no currently accepted medical use, which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Governments official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal governments center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI admitted that cannabis kills cancer uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way prove that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that the National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\" However, after a thorough investigation of the retrieved article from Snopes, it is clear that the caption is inaccurate. The Snopes article primarily discusses viral stories that falsely suggest the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has made a definitive statement claiming that cannabis kills cancer cells, citing misinformation that these stories rely upon. It explains that these viral claims reference a 2015 update to the NCI's Physician Data Query (PDQ) on Cannabis and Cannabinoids, which consistently mentions laboratory and animal studies suggesting possible anti-tumor effects of cannabis but does not confirm that cannabis definitively kills cancer in human patients. The articles state that the descriptions made about the PDQ are often misconstrued by outsiders. Furthermore, the Snopes article clearly states, \"Because the article making the claim that the NCI admitted that cannabis kills cancer uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way prove that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.\" \n\nThus, the caption directly contradicts the thorough investigation provided by the related article. The claim that the National Cancer Institute has admitted cannabis kills cancer is therefore not only unverified but actively debunked. \n",

The article explains that the PDQ summaries are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH, reinforcing that no definitive admission is made by the NCI regarding cannabis effectively killing cancer.  \n3. The repeated mention in the PDQ of studies indicating potential anti-tumor effects are made clear in the article, yet these do not offer conclusive evidence that cannabis can actually cure or kill cancer in humans; this reinforces the falsity of the claims made in the caption."

    "final_answer": "False",
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\" An internal check confirms that the entities mentioned (National Cancer Institute) are correctly identified. However, the context of the claim is immensely misleading. The NCI does conduct research into cannabis and its effects, especially regarding symptom management in various conditions, including cancer treatments. Current scientific consensus does not support the assertion that cannabis can definitively kill cancer cells. Instead, research is ongoing and many studies indicate that while certain compounds in cannabis may have anti-tumor properties in laboratory conditions, they do not conclusively 'kill' cancer in humans. \n\nFurther external validation from sources like Snopes debunks this claim comprehensively, indicating that viral stories suggesting an admission by the NCI are based on misinterpretations of research findings. Up to now, there is no official NCI conclusion stating that cannabis can cure cancer, and thus implying such an admission without qualifying statements is grossly inaccurate. The phrasing \"has admitted that cannabis kills cancer\" lacks the crucial context necessary for such a serious health claim.",

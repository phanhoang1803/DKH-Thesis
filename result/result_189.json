Mobile surveillance and detection have been standard practices in modern border security initiatives, making the tasks outlined in the caption reasonable and aligned with known military operations. There is consistency in the statement regarding the focus of these troops, and there are no apparent contradictions in the context of the described duties. The complexities and varying interpretations of military deployments and border security are acknowledged, yet the essentials depicted are credible. Overall, the content of this news caption is factually sound and logically consistent with established practices and policies regarding border security efforts.",

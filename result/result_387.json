      "explanation": "The news caption \"A video shows an eagle carrying a shark\" is not supported by the retrieved related articles. The relevant article discusses an incident involving a wedge-tailed eagle attempting to carry off a young boy, with no mention or evidence of an eagle carrying a shark. The main focus of the article is on the encounter between the eagle and the boy during a wildlife show in Australia, which is entirely different from the claim made in the caption. \n\nWhen evaluating the sources, the first article center-stages an incident where an eagle tried to lift a child, providing details about the context, witnesses, and impact of the event. The lack of any mention regarding an eagle carrying a shark means that there is no corroborative information that validates the caption. The incident is of an entirely different nature, focusing on the interaction between an eagle and a human child rather than a predatory act towards a shark. \n\nAdditionally, the content of the article does not provide any shift in species (from shark to boy); therefore, there is a clear thematic and factual misalignment with the caption. Given that the caption claims an eagle carrying a shark and there are no sources related to such an event, it stands refuted by the existing relevant article content, which explicitly discusses a completely different scenario.",

    "final_answer": "True",
    "explanation": "The evaluation of the provided caption \"A video shows an eagle carrying a shark\" revealed significant inaccuracies. The internal check indicated that there were no extracted visual entities or internal consistency to support the claim of an eagle carrying a shark. Without visual evidence or corroborating details, the caption's accuracy was called into question. The external check further refuted the caption by referencing an article that discussed a completely different incident involving an eagle attempting to carry off a young boy during a wildlife display in Australia, with no mention of any shark. This discrepancy highlights a clear misalignement between the claims of the caption and available factual information. Therefore, the caption misrepresents the context and is deemed to be out of context (OOC).",

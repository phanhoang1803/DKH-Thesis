        "title": "Are ride-share electric scooters the future of urban transport?",
        "date": "2018-04-25T05:00:39",
        "content": "Electric share scooters have taken over Santa Monica, an affluent beachside city on the edge of Los Angeles, but as they swiftly spread across other cities in California and the US a backlash is already gathering force.\nDownload an app, scan a scooters barcode and away you go, zipping at up to 15mph to your destination. You leave the scooter on the pavement for the next rider.\nBird, a startup run by former Uber executives, launched the scooters in Santa Monica last September. Hundreds were deposited around the city overnight, the devices so ubiquitous people literally tripped over them.\nThey have thrilled, bemused and aggravated  feelings San Francisco, San Jose, Austin and Washington DC are now experiencing as scooters from Bird and two other startups, LimeBike and Spin, hit their streets, with dozens more cities due to receive them this year.\nA full-scale backlash is under way in San Francisco, where some scooters have been tossed into trash cans and lakes. The city attorney has threatened to impound scooters, calling them dangerous, unlawful and examples of tech arrogance. City hall is exploring ways to regulate the devices.\nWith a global market in their sights, the scooter startups are pushing back\nBird comes armed with $115m (80.3m) in investment funding and seems to take the Uber-esque, hard-charging stance on regulation that it is better to seek forgiveness than permission. A tangle with Santa Monica officials earned a criminal complaint and hefty fine.\nThe demand is huge. Were looking to reach more than 50 markets this year and eventually have Birds all over the world, says Stephen Schnell, the companys vice president of operations, noting that Britain is on the companys radar. We try to pick cities that have bicycle lane infrastructure.\nSchnell, like Birds CEO Travis VanderZanden, previously worked at Lyft and Uber.\nRide sharing companies are shaking up urban transport but many commuters still have the last mile problem: a distance too far to walk and too short to drive, says Schnell. This is a way to get people out of their vehicles.\nMarlon Boarnet, an urban planning and spatial analysis professor at the University of Southern California, says dockless scooters can facilitate short trips while being light on the environment and using minimal space.\nTraditionally we view this as walking or bicycling, but the concept can and should be extended to light and small powered vehicles like electric scooters. One could also include in this set small neighborhood electric vehicles or electric motor assisted bicycles. We should expand our idea of what an acceptable short trip vehicle is.\nBoarnet hopes the companies and city authorities can resolve issues such as where the scooters are left. When clumped in the middle of a pavement scooters can seem more nuisance clutter than transport revolution.\nThe boom and bust of dockless bicycles in several markets  exemplified by a picture of a bicycle graveyard in China  act as a cautionary tale.\nThe Guardian scooted around Santa Monica for a week to try them out. The longest journey was from the citys downtown to Birds headquarters in Venice, three miles away. It took 17 minutes and cost $3.55  a $1 base fee plus 15 cents per minute.\nThe experience was positive. Scooters were easy to find with the apps map pinpointing devices left by trees, parking meters, benches and doorways.\nOnce youve scanned and unlocked the barcode with your phone theres a childlike glee in kicking off with your foot, pushing the handlebars throttle button and gliding down the street.\nNot encased in a shell of metal and glass, you feel connected to your surroundings  both hands are needed to steer so it is difficult to text or fiddle with your phone.\nTootling down Main Street, the most striking impression was the response of pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders and motorists: in most cases there wasnt one. In September the scooters were a novelty and drew stares. Now theyre part of the streetscape and barely remarked upon  except by some tourists who gawk and take pictures.\nBird reports quick adoption; there are more than 50,000 regular riders in and around Santa Monica, and riders in San Francisco notched up more than 60,000 miles in just 17 days. Its kind of amazing, says Schnell.\nWhats amazing, say critics, is the irresponsibility of the scooter companies and many of their riders.\nFew wear helmets in Santa Monica. It is common to see children riding scooters, two people on one scooter, parked scooters cluttering sidewalks and moving scooters scattering pedestrians on sidewalks. San Francisco residents have joined Santa Monicans in venting on social media.\nRiders are supposed to be licensed drivers, helmeted and are meant to ride on streets, preferably in bicycle lanes. Users need a drivers licence to download the app and upon request Bird sends free helmets. Still, improper use abounds. According to a city spokesperson, so far Santa Monica has recorded 11 accidents, some serious, 328 citations and 694 traffic stops.\nIrked that Bird launched with little or no warning, city authorities filed a criminal complaint over lack of business licences and vendor permits. Both sides settled in February, with Bird promising to seek the licences and to pay more than $300,000 in fines.\nEven though they got off to a rocky start we didnt move to kick them out because based on our values were really committed to this new model of mobility, says Anuj Gupta, Santa Monicas deputy city manager.\nThere has been no detectable impact on car congestion but scooters are now part of the transport mix, he says. We honestly understand and share in the excitement about these devices.\nBut theres another concern. If Bird and rival startups plant scooters on every block wont people have even less incentive to walk and exercise?\nYou mean WALL-E world, says Schnell, referencing the Pixar film in which future humans become obese gluttons ensconced in padded floating arm chairs. Lets hope not. With the scooters at least you have to stand.",

      "explanation": "The caption states, \"Riding one Bird scooter along Venice Beach, while also transporting three others.\" After analyzing the relevant content retrieved from the articles about the Bird scooters, there is a substantial alignment of the caption with the reported information. \n\nThe article describes the context of electric scooters, specifically mentioning Bird, which is a key entity in the caption. It highlights how Bird scooters are operational in areas like Santa Monica and Venice Beach, aligning with the statement in the caption about riding a Bird scooter in Venice Beach. \n\nNo part of the articles contradicts the claim about riding a Bird scooter or suggests that transporting three others is implausible. In fact, the articles indicate that riding scooters is common, and there are various usages, including riding with companions. While specific reporting on a rider transporting three scooters is not featured in the articles, given the nature of scooter sharing, it is plausible, as shared scooters are intended for convenience and mobility. \n\nAdditionally, the concept of riding multiple scooters at once is both feasible and consistent with testimonies of improper use, where individuals can often be seen riding in unconventional mannersâ€”such as two people on one scooter. The articles reflect an existing concern about scooter safety and conduct amongst riders, which could include similar scenarios as described in the caption.\n\nThe sources of the articles are credible (particularly because they come from established news domains), and they consistently report on the presence of Bird scooters in the Venice Beach area, confirming the operational context of the caption. Therefore, it can be concluded that the claim made in the caption holds true within the information provided by the articles, thus I affirmatively support the caption's accuracy.",

The internal check confirms the correct labeling of entities: 'Bird' (a scooter brand) and 'Venice Beach' (the location), with no discrepancies noted. The external validation reinforces this by indicating that Bird scooters are indeed operational in Venice Beach, supporting the context of riding while transporting additional scooters. Details about scooter usage and riding practices align with the mention in the caption and lend credibility to its accuracy. Thus, there are no contradictions found, confirming it's in context.",
    "additional_notes": "The caption could draw questions regarding the plausibility of transporting three additional scooters at once, but since Bird scooters are designed for sharing and can be visible in various unconventional ways in practice, it falls into a reasonable interpretation based on the nature of scooter usage, further supporting the caption's context.",

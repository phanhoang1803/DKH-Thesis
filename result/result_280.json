      "explanation": "The caption refers to a 'Pro-Choice Activist' who has purportedly broken a world record by getting her 27th abortion. The extracted entities from the caption include the terms 'Pro', '-', and 'Choice' which together form the phrase 'Pro-Choice'. This phrase is indeed contextually relevant to the topic of abortion rights and activism. However, without visual evidence, it is difficult to assess if the image supports the notion of 'breaking a world record' or the specific mention of 'her 27th abortion'. If the image portrays a person identified as an activist celebrating her achievement, it would align with the caption. Nonetheless, without additional context or visual support, the accuracy of such claims remains unverified. Furthermore, the term 'Pro-Choice' is correctly mentioned but the overall implications of breaking a world record for having multiple abortions might be sensationalistic and require careful contextual examination to avoid misinterpretation.",

In this case, the pictured \"Elena Travis\" was actually a Getty Images stock photograph labeled \"Happy Patient.\"\nWNDR includes a disclaimer stating that all of their content is fictional:\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.

The site includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says: World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\nThe made-up story, though, received more than 500,000 interactions on Facebook, including 47,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. It was also shared on YouTube and 4chan, an open, image-sharing forum, without the disclaimer. Some 4chan users commented that it was fake, but comments by others indicated that some thought it was real.\nThe bogus story states that Elena Travis, who is described as a 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist, officially broke the world record after receiving her 27th abortion. The photos that accompany the story are actually stock photos from Getty Images.\nAside from the misidentified photos and a disclaimer at the bottom of the story, there are other indications that the story is false. There is no byline on the story and the clinic mentioned as performing the historic operation does not seem to exist.

      "explanation": "The caption \"Pro-Choice Activist proudly breaks world record by getting her 27th abortion\" is contradicted by multiple reliable sources that clarify this claim as a satire rather than a genuine news report. Both sources of supporting articles (Snopes and FactCheck.org) indicate that the original story was published by World News Daily Report (WNDR), a site known for producing fictional and satirical content. The claim about a pro-choice activist obtaining her 27th abortion has been labeled completely false. The original article, which was the basis for the caption, explicitly states that there is no real-world basis for the record, as this is something fabricated by a satirical outlet.\n\nSpecifically, the Snopes article reported that, \"This story was made up by a satirical website,\" and noted that WNDR includes a disclaimer indicating the fictional nature of its articles. The same sentiment is echoed by FactCheck.org, stating, \"The story was made up by a satirical website\" and further explains details regarding the lack of genuine evidence, such as no existence of the clinic mentioned in the article and identification errors in the accompanying images.\n\nAdditionally, the articles outline that the purported activist, named Elena Travis, is likely a fictitious character created for the story. The articles emphasize that WNDR creates these hoaxes with the intent to mislead the reader, despite presenting it under the guise of a news story. Thus, the statement regarding the pro-choice activist breaking a world record by obtaining her 27th abortion is not just unsupported; it has been directly debunked.\nIn summary, the caption is a misrepresentation based on a satirical piece that should not be considered factual news. Therefore, the final judgment is that the news caption is completely inaccurate concerning any real and reportable event, resulting in a low confidence score of 2. \n\nKey points from the articles include:\n- \"A California 'pro-choice activist' set a world record by going through her 27th abortion.\" (Source: Snopes.com)\n- \"This story was made up by a satirical website.\" (Source: FactCheck.org)",

    "explanation": "The caption \"Pro-Choice Activist proudly breaks world record by getting her 27th abortion\" is factually incorrect as it suggests a serious claim of record-breaking for the number of abortions. The internal validation confirms that the phrase \"Pro-Choice Activist\" is accurate within the context of abortion rights activism. However, there is a significant issue here: the external validation indicates that this story originates from a satirical outlet, World News Daily Report (WNDR), which is known for publishing fictional stories presented as news. Both Snopes and FactCheck.org verified that the narrative is a fabrication and not a true event. Furthermore, there is no corroborating evidence that any individual has actually broken such a world record. Essentially, the caption perpetuates a satirical claim without basis in reality, classifying it as misleading and incorrect. Overall, significant inconsistencies exist between the internal checks and external fact-checking results. Thus, the confidence level for the given caption is low, rating it as significantly out of context and unsubstantiated.",

        "content": "LONDON  If James Graham has learned one thing from writing his latest political drama, it is this: Brexit sends reasonable people mad, he said. You are stepping into an arena where normal rules dont apply.\nThat drama, Brexit: The Uncivil War, a TV movie about the 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, was broadcast in the country on Monday and debuts on HBO in the United States on Jan. 19. The shows making was unusually fraught, plagued by the leaks, squabbles and contradictory briefings that also characterize British politics.\nFirst, in July, an early draft of the script was leaked and commentators rushed to mock it and question its truthfulness. Stephen K. Bannon, President Trumps former chief strategist and a vocal supporter of Brexit, weighed in, branding the unfinished work a clown show and a comic-book fantasy.\nThen, in December, HBO shared a trailer for the movie, starring a balding Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Leave campaign. Uproar, once more.\nEveryone knows who won, Cumberbatch says in the two-minute video. But not everyone knows how.\nHow is still a matter of controversy. In July, the Electoral Commission in Britain found that the Leave campaign, which won 52 percent to 48 percent, had broken the law by exceeding the campaign spending limit of 7 million pounds, or about $9 million at current exchange rates. The police are still assessing whether to start a criminal investigation. Carole Cadwalladr, a British journalist who has conducted extensive investigations into the finances of the Leave campaign, said on Twitter that HBO was literally interfering in our criminal justice system.\nOthers questioned the timing and legitimacy of a drama about a political event which is, to use TV parlance, still several months from its season finale. The reaction shocked, surprised and scared me, Graham said in an interview in London last month.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

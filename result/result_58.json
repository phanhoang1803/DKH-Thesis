The extracted entities are \"Denver\", \"International\", and \"Airport\" which reference the location. Upon analyzing the provided visual evidence, the entities appear to be used correctly as they directly refer to the specified mural's location, the Denver International Airport. Additionally, if the mural indeed depicts citizens of the world wearing masks as the caption states, that aspect would also be visually representable. The temporal aspect is also valid, given that the mention of 1994 aligns with the possible existence of this mural in the right location. Since the caption and the entities align well based on the provided information, the assessment indicates a correct usage of entities with a high degree of confidence.

        "content": "Claim:\nAn image shows a mural painted in 1994 at Denver International Airport that shows citizens of the world wearing masks.\nIn June 2020, a photograph supposedly showing a mural that was painted at Denver International Airport in 1994 that depicted people from around the world wearing masks started to circulate on social media:\nLike many social media rumors about \"predictions,\" this image does not show a decades-old mural that foretold future events. Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one  or more!  of CJ Trinidads shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

        "content": "Quick Take\nViral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994  and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFull Story\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork  depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries  was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\nThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994, the posts read. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airports public art available on the airports website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is not from DENs art collection. The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. Its called Children of the World Dream of Peace, but it doesnt include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting  posted by Trinidad days earlier  on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece Maskcommunication.\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, United Against Corona- Express through Art, by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the [d]ate of submission as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February  though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name NEHA appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting  and well update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994  and its false to say that its a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\nA Facebook post went even further into the false conspiracy theory, posting an image of the painting with the caption, Illuminati art works on display.\nHowever, these posts are not correct.\nThe communications office at the Denver airport told The Associated Press in an email that the painting in question is not an image from the airports art collection.\nThe only mural painted in 1994 for DEN featuring international children wearing traditional clothing and that also features flags is Leo Tangumas Children of the World Dream of Peace, but there are no kids wearing masks, said Alex Rentera, a public information officer for the airport.\nWhats more, the image was not circulating on the internet before this year. In a reverse-image search, the AP found that the oldest posts available are from February 2020.\nA Filipino artist named Christian Joy Trinidad painted the work, which he called Maskcommunication.\nThe artists Instagram account features a photograph of the painting, which confirms that the version on Facebook has been edited. The version spreading online features a boy wearing a mask with an Israeli flag. But in the original, that boy is actually wearing a mask with a Palestinian flag.\nThe AP contacted Trinidad and he confirmed through an Instagram message that he created the painting for a contest in late February.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson contributed to this report from Seattle.\n__\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that there is an image of a mural painted in 1994 at Denver International Airport depicting citizens of the world wearing masks. This claim is directly contradicted by multiple relevant articles retrieved. All of the sources clearly establish that there is no such mural at the Denver International Airport from 1994 and that the mural in question is a modern artwork created after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, attributed to artist CJ Trinidad and titled \"Maskcommunication.\n\nThe articles provide a consistent narrative regarding the false claims circulating about the mural. Source 1 states, \"this image does not show a decades-old mural that foretold future events\" and further clarifies that the painting is a reflection of the COVID-19 pandemic. It outlines that the first known posts of this artwork appeared in early 2020, significantly later than the 1994 date asserted in the caption. Additionally, it mentions that the mural has been incorrectly attributed to multiple artists.\n\nSource 2 confirms this by stating, \"Viral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994\" and emphasizes that \"the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airport's public art available on the airport's website.\" Furthermore, it separates this painting from the actual mural that appared at the Denver airport in 1994, titled \"Children of the World Dream of Peace,\" which does not feature children in masks. It also discusses how this misinformation has sparked conspiracy theories about the pandemic being foreseen.\n\nSource 3 corroborates the previous articles by reiterating that the social media claims about the mural being displayed at Denver airport in 1994 are \"False\" and emphasizes that the airport's communications office confirmed that the painting is not part of their art collection. This article adds more context regarding the actual mural created in 1994, specifically highlighting its focus on international children in traditional clothing without masks. The source also includes specific details about the artist CJ Trinidad and the emergence of the painting repurposed to relate to the pandemic instead. \n\nOverall, the caption lacks support from the articles, all of which highlight the inaccuracy of the claims made about a 1994 Denver International Airport mural depicting masked individuals. Given the clear and consistent information provided by these credible sources, one can confidently conclude that the news caption is incorrect and misleading.",

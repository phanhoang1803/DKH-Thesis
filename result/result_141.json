        "content": "Claim:\nThe U.S. has a global trade deficit of $800 billion.\nOn 8 March 2018 President Donald Trump repeated an often-derided claim regarding the U.S. trade deficit during a press conference in the White House.\nThe president said that the country currently has a global trade deficit of $800 billion  a statement he has reportedly made more than 50 times since 2015. The remark at the press confrence came one day after he repeated the claim on his Twitter account. However, as news outlets have pointed out, that figure leaves out the fact that the U.S. has a trade surplus. As a report released by the Commerce Department shows, the actual deficit is $566 billion:\nThe report said:\nThe 2017 increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of $57.5 billion or 7.6 percent to $810.0 billion and a decrease in the services surplus of $3.7 billion or 1.5 percent to $244.0 billion.\nA report published by the White House in February 2018 stated that the U.S. economy has become more dependent on trade involving \"private service-producing industries\" such as engineering, travel, and finance among others:\nTravel (including that for educational purposes) has constituted the largest share of U.S. services exports. Services trade between countries has continued to grow  given declining travel costs, improvements in telecommunications, and growth in online services that allow, for example, computer coding to take place in remote locations. This allows the United States to export high-skilled services to other countries that do not share our\nexpertise and training advantages.\nFocusing on trade of tangible goods alone, the report added, ignored the country's \"comparative advantage\" in service-related trade.\nTrump reiterated his misleading claim on the same day he officially imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum, respectively. Mexico and Canada  the country's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement  are exempted from those tariffs, and other countries will be allowed to petition for separate exemptions. The president's plan to impose the tariffs led to the resignation of White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn on 6 March 2018.",

        "content": "Claim: The US is suffering from a trade imbalance, with a trade deficit of $800bn (579bn) in 2017.\nReality Check verdict: The President is incorrect about the US trade deficit - it was $566bn (410bn) in 2017. Economists generally agree that neither trade deficits nor surpluses are necessarily 'good' or 'bad' for an economy.\nIn a marked change of direction from his predecessors and decades of American trade policy, US President Donald Trump signalled a shift away from free trade towards more protectionist policies by signing two proclamations which levied significant tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium into the United States.\nPart of his justification for the move was his belief that US trade deficits have hurt the US economy.\nIn remarks at the White House announcing the trade tariff plan, President Trump said \"we lose $800bn (578bn) a year on trade, every year\".\nIt's a claim he's made repeatedly, in tweets and speeches.\nWhat's he referring to?\nPresident Trump seems to be citing the fact that the US imported $810bn worth of goods in 2017. That was what he referenced in a June 2016 campaign speech in Pittsburgh, which many in his administration are pointing to now to suggest they've fulfilled a campaign promise.\nBut in doing so, he's ignoring the amount of services the US exported in 2017, which totalled $242.7bn.\nDiscounting that contribution to US trade ignores a significant part of what makes the US economy tick.\nThis is why most economists agree that the US trade deficit in 2017 was $566bn (410bn).\nLike many developed economies, the US has shifted over the past century from an economy primarily focused on manufacturing goods to one that is primarily composed of services. The service sector accounts for 90 million US jobs and 80% of US economic activity, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe biggest US service exports were travel and tourism, financial services like banking, and environmental services.\nWhat about China?\nIn the White House speech, and in recent days, President Trump has taken particular aim at China - saying the US is losing out because of a $500bn trade deficit with China, which he also mentioned during a 5 March speech.\nHowever, the US has never run a trade deficit with China that is above $337bn.\nOver the past ten years, the US has run an annual trade deficit with China that's hovered between $200bn and $300bn.\nAnd when it comes to steel and aluminium imports to the US, China barely ranks.\nAlthough China has nearly half of the world's steel-making capacity according to the OECD, the US imports the majority of its steel from Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico.\nIn 2017, Chinese steel imports accounted for just 2% of the 34 million tonnes of steel the US imported, or 3% of the total value.\nManufacturing jobs lost\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose accept and continue.\nA big reason President Trump has pursued these tariffs is his desire to appeal to manufacturing workers in Democratic swing states like Ohio. He has specifically said he wants to see the US return to being a country that \"makes\" goods.\nIn the past, he's cited statistics that he says indicate that poor trade policies have hurt the US manufacturing sector overall.\nFor instance, in a tweet earlier in the week President Trump said that since President George H.W. Bush came into office in 1989, the US has lost 55,000 factories and six million manufacturing jobs.\nAccording to the US Census bureau, the US actually lost a total of 77,314 manufacturing establishments from 1989 until 2014 (the last year for which data is available).\nHowever, establishments can encompass anything from a traditional factory to something like a bakery or a candy store, so it is hard to definitively say if more than 70,000 factories were lost in the intervening decades.\nIn terms of manufacturing employment, these numbers are slightly exaggerated. The US lost a total of 5.5 million manufacturing jobs since 1989.\nUS manufacturing employment peaked in 1979. It suffered its sharpest declines in employment in the early 1980s. Since then, manufacturing employment in America has been on the decline.\nSome of the decline is certainly due to unfair trade practices - but a large portion of it could be due to automation, which has resulted in fewer workers on factory floors.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions",

        "content": "When asked whether he would impose tariffs on cars imported from the European Union, President Donald Trump, as he regularly does, used an inflated figure for the trade balance between the U.S. and the EU. The deficit was $101 billion for 2017, not $151 billion, as he repeatedly claims.\nTrump, for years, has been using the goods-only figures for the U.S. trade deficit, instead of the goods-and-services deficit, to justify his trade policies. Since the United States exports a lot of services  such as travel, transportation, finance and intellectual property  Trump skews the trade picture by completely discounting the service trade. The U.S., in fact, has an overall trade surplus in services.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump wrongly claimed again and again that the U.S. trade deficit was nearly $800 billion, a generous rounding-up of the goods-only deficit of $758.9 billion in 2015, the latest figure at the time. The overall goods-and-services deficit was $531.5 billion then. He repeatedly claimed the deficit with China was $500 billion  close to the overall deficit with all countries. (The latest figure for China is $335.7 billion for 2017, despite Trumps assertion on Feb. 15 that a lot of people think its $506 billion.)\nSimilarly, he has distorted the trade figures for Canada and Mexico.\nTrump continues to falsely claim the U.S. has large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, when theres a trade surplus with Canada ($2.8 billion in 2017), and the deficit with Mexico ($68.7 billion) amounts to 11 percent of the total two-way trade with the U.S.\nThe president made his latest false claim about U.S. trade with the EU during an appearance with the federal chancellor of Austria. A reporter asked about a potential tariff Trump has proposed on automobiles and auto parts from the EU. In his response, Trump said:\nTrump, Feb. 20: Theyre very tough to make a deal with  the EU.  If we dont make the deal, well do the tariffs.  But the bottom-line result is whether or not we can make a deal with the EU thats fair. We lose about $151 billion trading with the EU. Thats a lot of money. And this has been going on for many years.\nThats a lot of money, but the wrong figure. Its 50 percent higher than the actual trade deficit with the EU.\nAnd the trade deficit has been going up under Trump. It was $101.2 billion with the EU in 2017, up nearly 10 percent from $92.1 billion in 2016, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published by the Census Bureau. In the last four quarters  from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the third quarter of 2018  the deficit was $113 billion.\nTrump consistently uses the goods-only figure, which also has risen, from $146.8 billion in 2016 to $151.4 billion in 2017 and $154.2 billion in 2018.\nAccording to the Washington Post Fact Checkers database of Trumps claims, the president has repeated his false claim about the EU trade deficit 131 times.\nTotal trade between the EU and U.S. was $1.1 trillion in 2016, and the EU is the largest goods trading partner for the U.S., according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\nEarly last summer, Trump threatened to put a 20 percent tariff on cars exported from the EU to the United States. At the time, the U.S. had added new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including those from the EU, and the EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products. On July 27, the EU and the United States agreed to hold trade negotiations and to not impose further tariffs in the meantime.\nIn an Aug. 21 rally in West Virginia, the president said: We are going to put a 25 percent tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States. And thatll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion dollars and give us a surplus of $151 billion.\nOn Feb. 17, the Commerce Department submitted a study to Trump on how automobile and auto parts imports affect national security. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the president can implement trade restrictions if the Commerce Department finds that imports harm national security. Such a finding was used by Trump to apply the steel and aluminum tariffs last year.",

When the service sector is excluded, the gap was even greater, rising to a record $891.3 billion.\nThe overall trade deficit has grown by $119 billion in the two years since Trump took office.\nLoading...\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\"We have almost an $800 billion a year trade deficit with other nations,\" Trump said in November 2017. \"Unacceptable. We are going to start whittling that down and as fast as possible.\"\nThe deficit, which is the difference between the goods and services the U.S. buys from other countries and those it sells to them, rose to a seasonally adjusted $59.8 billion in December  an increase of almost 19 percent.\nThe goods trade deficit with China rose to a record $419.2 billion, despite Trump's decision last year to impose tariffs on $50 billion in imports from the country.\nHe has also threatened to raise tariffs on another $200 billion if no progress is made in ongoing negotiations with Beijing.\nTrump also slapped tariffs, which are a kind of tax on imported goods, on steel and aluminum imports, a move that led to retaliation from some U.S. trading partners.\nThe trade gap is growing in large part because the U.S. economy has been strong compared to other major countries. That typically means Americans buy more from other nations.\nMost economists do not consider a trade deficit to be a marker of economic weakness. But Trump has consistently singled out the trade gap as a target in his America First policies. Ironically, the administration's tax cuts may have actually helped to increase the trade deficit by juicing spending on overseas goods by consumers and companies.\nAlso, the dollar strengthened against other currencies in the latter part of 2018, making foreign goods more affordable for Americans. The dollar's climb was partly due to a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.",

This claim is directly contradicted by multiple relevant articles that analyze Trump's statements about the trade deficit. \n\n1.

The article states, \"The president said that the country currently has a global trade deficit of $800 billion, a statement he has reportedly made more than 50 times since 2015,\" which signals that the $800 billion figure is not accurate when considering total trade data, including services.\n\n2. Source 2 directly addresses Trump's claims and states that his figure was incorrect, reporting a deficit of $566 billion for 2017 and clarifying that \"economists generally agree that neither trade deficits nor surpluses are necessarily 'good' or 'bad' for an economy.\" The reasoning here is that Trump’s $800 billion figure likely arises from his focus on goods trade alone, while the services surplus should also be factored into the overall trade balance. \n\n3. Source 3 discusses Trump's habit of inflating trade deficit figures, indicating that he often uses goods-only figures to support his narrative, stating that the overall goods-and-services deficit was $531.5 billion in 2016. This highlights how Trump’s repeated proclamations about an $800 billion deficit are misleading due to the exclusion of service sector contributions. \n\n4. Source 4 also addresses the trade deficit directly, talking about the increase in the U.S. trade deficit reaching a ten-year high but does not support the $800 billion figure Trump cited. Instead, it suggests that the trade dynamics are complex and led to an overall trade deficit that does not match Trump’s assertion. \n\nGiven these facts, Trump's assertion of an $800 billion global trade deficit lacks substantive support and is contradicted by reliable reporting from multiple sources.

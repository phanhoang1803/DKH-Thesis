        "content": "US President Barack Obama has made a rare Oval Office address after the San Bernardino shootings that left 14 dead.\nHe said the killings were \"an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people\".\nBut \"freedom is more powerful than fear,\" said President Obama, warning that falling prey to divisiveness in American society would play into the hands of extremists.\nHe also said the US must make it harder for potential attackers to obtain guns.\nMr Obama vowed that the US would overcome the evolving threat of terrorism, but warned that Americans \"cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam\".\n\"If we're to succeed in defeating terrorism, we must enlist Muslim communities as some of our strongest allies, rather than push them away through suspicion and hate,\" Mr Obama said.\nHe reminded his audience that Muslim-Americans were part of US society.\n\"And, yes, they are our men and women in uniform who are willing to die in defence of our country. We have to remember that,\" he said.\nThe president warned that turning against America's Muslim communities would be exactly what Islamist extremists in the so-called Islamic State group want.\nMedia reaction to Obama's speech\nMr Obama told Americans that terrorism had entered a new phase, from large scale attacks by al-Qaeda to less complicated attacks by radicalised individuals.\nHe said the US would draw upon \"every aspect of American power\" to combat IS.\nHe underscored that the US and its allies have increased their bombing of Islamic State oil infrastructure and would continue to train and equip moderate rebels in Iraq and Syria.\n\"Our military will continue to hunt down terrorist plotters in any country where it is necessary,\" he said.\nThe president added that there are a number of things that can be done on home soil to combat terrorism.\nHe called for stricter gun control and said he had ordered the Departments of State and Homeland Security to review the K-1 fiance visa programme under which the female attacker in San Bernardino originally entered the US.\nThis was only the third Oval Office address of Mr Obama's presidency - they are reserved for events of national importance.\nFormer governor Jeb Bush said the president's remarks were \"weak\". Mr Bush said: \"This is the war of our time. It shouldn't be business as usual. We need a war-time Commander-in-Chief who is ready to lead this country and the free world to victory.\"\nResponding to the address, Florida senator Marco Rubio said Mr Obama's strategy was \"absurd\" and called for increased surveillance efforts. \"We need to be able to gather more intelligence, not less intelligence,\" he said.\nOhio governor John Kasich said the president's strategy was \"not enough\" and called for the US to deploy ground troops against IS. He said: \"Without taking the fight to ISIS on the ground, ISIS won't be defeated.\"\nCarly Fiorina, the former CEO of HP, said the speech was \"vintage Obama\". \"No strategy, no leadership. Politics as usual,\" she said.\nGeorge E. Pataki, former governor of New York, controversially said Obama's address was \"as believable as a hostage video\". He said: \"Pathetic response to the worst attack on US since 9/11.\"\nPresident Barack Obama for the first time made a clear connection between a series of deadly attacks on US soil during his time in office.\nThe Boston Marathon bombing and shootings at a military base in Texas, an Army recruiting station in Tennessee and now in San Bernardino all represent a \"new phase\" of \"terrorist threat\" to the US, he said.\nMr Obama's goal was to convince an increasingly sceptical US public that he has a plan to address this danger - which doesn't involve large numbers of US forces in the Middle East, intrusive monitoring of American Muslims or framing the conflict as one with all of Islam.\nWhile the president may find support for a congressional authorisation of military force to fight IS, he will anger many with his call to prevent those on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms and place greater limits on the sale of \"powerful assault weapons\".\nMr Obama may have ended his speech by urging Americans to unify around their common ideals, but there are few issues more divisive in the US than that of gun rights.\nObama's call for unity is a tall order\nThe couple used handguns and semi-automatic weapons that had been legally purchased in the US, police say.\nBomb equipment, weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition were later found in their home.\nIt is the deadliest mass shooting in the US since 26 people were killed at a school in Connecticut in 2012.\nThe authorities said there was no indication so far the killers were part of an \"organised group or formed part of a broader terrorist cell\".",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that President Donald Trump stated Canadian women were the second biggest threat to America after ISIS.  This claim is factually incorrect and unsupported by verifiable evidence.  The internal check correctly identifies this discrepancy. The image shows a woman with a Canadian flag painted on her cheek; it is completely unrelated to President Trump's alleged statement. There is no visual evidence or contextual clues within the image to support the caption's claim. The external check reinforces this by finding no credible sources corroborating the statement attributed to President Trump.  The lack of any connection between the image and the caption's content leads to a definitive conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the assessment; the internal and external checks concur strongly on the factual inaccuracy and irrelevance of the caption to the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks conclusively confirm that the caption is out of context. The image depicts a woman with a Canadian flag painted on her cheek, while the caption falsely attributes a statement to President Trump about Canadian women posing a threat to America. There's no visual or factual link between the image and the caption."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows U.S. President Joe Biden talking to reporters in front of a green screen.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn March 17, 2021, a video started circulating on social media that many users claimed featured U.S. President Joe Biden talking to reporters in front of a green screen to make it appear he was in a location where he was not:\nThis is a genuine video of Biden talking to pool reporters. The claim that Biden was using a green screen (a device used in movies and TV to alter the background) is based on an odd visual in this video when Biden's hand appears to come in front of a fuzzy grey microphone. This rumor was popular on the r/conspiracy section of Reddit, but it was also spread by retired athletes and popular conservative social media personalities such as Aubrey Huff and Tito Ortiz.\nHuff wrote: \"@JoeBiden taking questions in front of the green screen. Notice the hand going right through the microphone. Its all a big production.....and so many of you are falling for it. Wake up!\"\nWhile this visual may look a little odd, the claim that it shows Biden using a green screen quickly falls apart upon closer examination. For starters, it's important to note that the microphones in this video are being held by boom poles. While we might be accustomed to seeing reporters holding their own microphones, social distance protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic have forced reporters to start using boom mics. These mics are also larger than some might anticipate, as illustrated by the photograph at the top of this article provides.\nIn other words, Biden is standing directly in front of several large boom mics, but is still several feet away from the reporters. When it appears that Biden's hand crosses over the microphone, it's because it actually does, it just looks a little funny because the mics are both larger than anticipated and at a different distance than expected. Here's a diagram from Captain Disillusion, a visual effects specialist, to better illustrate this point:\nHere's another angle of this purported \"green screen\" moment from The Washington Post:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/biden-does-not-plan-to-travel-to-border-amid-migrant-surge/2021/03/16/d991feff-9f5b-4644-98c9-5fc3588a3c18_video.html\nSteve Herman, the reporter who was holding the fuzzy grey microphone in this video, posted a message on Twitter saying that he was \"literally in front\" of the president when this video was filmed. In other words, Herman and Biden were both together on the south lawn of the White House, not in a studio with a green screen.\nThe claim that Biden was speaking in front of a green screen is part of a larger conspiracy theory holding that Biden presidency is being \"faked\" in one manner or another.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim that Joe Biden was speaking in front of a green screen.  It rates the claim as false, providing evidence that the video in question shows Biden speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn. The visual anomaly cited as evidence of a green screen is explained as a result of the size and positioning of boom microphones used due to COVID-19 distancing protocols.  A reporter present confirms his proximity to the President. The caption is therefore inaccurate.",

It quotes social media posts circulating the false claim and provides evidence showing the alleged 'green screen' was actually boom microphones. A reporter confirms he was close to Biden during the recording. ",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Joe Biden was taking questions in front of a green screen.  Internal validation, with a confidence score of 10, determined this to be false based on a visual inspection of the image. The image shows Biden speaking outdoors, surrounded by microphones and reporters, with no green screen visible.  External validation, with a confidence score of 8, further confirms this assessment.  The external check references a Snopes article which debunks the claim of a green screen. The article explains that what appeared to be a green screen was actually a result of the size and positioning of boom microphones used due to COVID-19 distancing protocols. A reporter present also confirmed their proximity to President Biden, corroborating the absence of a green screen.  Both internal and external checks strongly support the conclusion that the original caption is inaccurate. The image shows Biden outdoors, interacting with reporters, and there's no evidence of a green screen. Therefore, the caption is demonstrably out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly agree that the original caption, which claims Joe Biden was speaking in front of a green screen, is false. The image clearly shows him outdoors with reporters and microphones, without any green screen present.  External verification includes a Snopes article which refutes the claim."

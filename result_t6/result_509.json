Hodas posted the video to Instagram (with tags such as #3D, #photoshop, #render, and #animation), and provided extra insight into how the video was created in response to a query on Facebook:\npretty much! depends on what I need. In this case I layered few planes with wm maps on top of each other and added a lot of zdepth fog to blend it in.\nNo records of volcanos emitting bright pink smoke exist, except those created by digital artists.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims an actual \"pink volcano\" erupted in New Zealand.  The internal check could not assess the caption's accuracy due to the absence of visual information. However, the external check, utilizing Snopes as a source, definitively refutes the claim. Snopes confirms that the video showing a pink volcano eruption in New Zealand is digitally manipulated and not a real event.  Furthermore, Snopes points out the lack of any documented cases of naturally occurring volcanoes producing bright pink smoke. This external evidence strongly contradicts the news caption.  Since the external verification provides strong evidence against the caption's accuracy and the internal check could not offer an assessment due to missing visual data, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from a reliable external source that directly refutes the caption's central claim.  The absence of supporting visual evidence from the original image further reinforces this conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate the caption is inaccurate. The external check, using Snopes, provides strong evidence that the video depicting a pink volcano is digitally fabricated, while the internal check could not assess due to a missing image. There is no visual evidence that supports the caption."

(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

    "explanation": "The caption claims the icebergs are from Lake Michigan. Internal validation correctly identifies this as false, citing the image's visual characteristics (a large iceberg in a cold, likely saltwater environment) which are inconsistent with Lake Michigan, a freshwater lake.  External validation strongly supports this conclusion, providing evidence that the image's origin is thousands of miles away from Lake Michigan and in a different hemisphere.  The external source provides a detailed explanation of how the image has been misrepresented online, with multiple instances of the image being falsely attributed to Lake Michigan.  Both internal and external validation methods concur that the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  There is no visual evidence that suggests the image has been tampered with; rather, the visual elements are consistent with the external verification of the image's true location and the description of the environment. The high confidence score is justified by the strong agreement between the internal and external validation, and the detailed supporting evidence provided by the external source. The visual evidence in the image reinforces the conclusion from both forms of validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly support the conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.  The image depicts icebergs in an environment clearly different from Lake Michigan, and external sources confirm this, providing evidence of the image's misattribution."

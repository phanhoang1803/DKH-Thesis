        "content": "Former President Donald Trump vowed to a Republican audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference to \"finish what we started.\"\n\"I am your warrior, I am your justice  and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,\" Trump said March 4 at the conference in National Harbor, Maryland. \"I will totally obliterate the deep state.\"\nWe fact-checked several false or misleading statements he made about the 2020 election, the border, the economy and war during his more-than-90 minute speech.\n\"I won the second election. I won it by a lot.\"\nSign up for PolitiFact texts\nWeve rated this Pants on Fire! Trump lost the election to Joe Biden in 2020. Biden won with 306 electoral votes, to Trumps 232. Biden won the popular vote by about 7 million.\nOfficials in Trumps own administration were among the experts who concluded the election was secure.\n\"We did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.\"\nThis is misleading and ignores the role of the Electoral College. Trump received more popular votes in 2020 (about 74 million) than 2016 (about 63 million). But the popular vote doesnt determine the presidential victor. Trump lost the Electoral College vote in 2020, so he lost that race for president.\nIn Arizona during the 2022 midterm elections, \"Republican areas, a tremendous percentage of the machines were broken and you couldnt vote.  They said come back in seven hours.\"\nTrump is wrong about Republicans being unable to vote in November. On Election Day in Maricopa County, some vote-counting machines couldnt read some ballots because of a printing error. The equipment problems happened at about 70 of the countys 223 vote centers. This was a significant inconvenience, and resulted in some voters waiting in long lines.\nBut people were not denied the right to vote. Voters who encountered a faulty tabulator were given other options, including staying and waiting for a working tabulator, voting at another voting location or putting their completed ballots in a secure slot so that officials could tabulate them later.\nTechnical problems at Maricopa County voting centers did not disproportionately affect Republican voters, according to a Washington Post analysis.\nA court rejected a request by the Republican National Committee to extend the countys voting hours. The court concluded there was no evidence that voters were precluded from voting. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit.\nIn 2022, \"France had 37 million people voting, they voted in one day and at 10:30 in the evening they called the winner.\"\nThis omits context about why tabulating votes is so much faster in France than in the U.S.\nWhen candidates run for president in the U.S., there are multiple local, state and federal races on the same ballot. The presidential contest in France in April 2022 had only one contest on the ballot.\nThere are other key differences in how elections operate in the two countries, including that in France nearly all voters cast their ballot on one day, in person. In the U.S., state laws generally give voters more options on how to vote, including by mail.\nBorder security\n\"I built hundreds of miles of wall and completed that task as promised.\"\nPolitiFact tracked Trumps promise to \"build a great wall\" and have Mexico pay for it and rated it a Promise Broken.\nTrump mainly replaced barriers installed by previous administrations. When he entered office in 2017, the U.S. had 654 miles of primary border barriers (some sections of the border have up to three layers of barriers that run parallel to the border; the first impediment a migrant may face is the primary barrier). By January 2021, that number increased to 706 miles, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nTrump replaced about 184 miles of dilapidated primary barriers with updated fences. When Trump says his administration \"build hundreds of miles,\" what he's referring to is the replacement of older barriers with new fences, not hundreds of miles of barriers protecting the border for the first time.\n\"Before Biden came into office, we had illegal immigration at a record low.\"\nThis is misleading and doesnt take into account that the coronavirus pandemic slowed down migration.\nIn fiscal year 2017, Border Patrol agents recorded 310,531 apprehensions nationwide, the lowest since 1971. (This included about four months of Obamas presidency.) But apprehensions increased after that, reaching 859,501 in fiscal year 2019.\nWhen the coronavirus began in early 2020, migration dropped, but then steadily rose after April 2020. And the way officials tracked migration data changed as the government implemented Title 42, a public health policy intended to limit the number of people coming into the U.S. This makes it hard to compare pre-pandemic immigration data to data after March 2020.\nEconomy\n\"We had the best employment numbers in history, we had the best economy in history.\"\nWe rated a similar claim False. The U.S. economy was strong before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020. But it was not the best in the nations history, economists told PolitiFact.\nBefore COVID-19, the unemployment rate under Trump hit historic lows. Experts said Trump could take some credit for this, but he also benefited from the continuation of trends that had been in place under former President Barack Obama.\nUnder Trump, growth in the nations gross domestic product  probably the single most important statistic used to gauge the overall strength of the economy  was similar to the rate under Obama and well below that of prior presidents.\nNational security\n\"I was the only president in decades\" who \"didn't have a war.\"\nAs we have reported previously, Trump did not seek congressional authorization to use military force, or formally declare war against any other country during his four-year term. He also didnt engage the U.S. in any new protracted conflicts. However, Trump did order and oversee new military operations under existing authorizations, including counterterrorism raids that spread to several countries in the Middle East and Africa.\nFormal declarations of war by Congress are rare, and have happened in just five conflicts: the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II. Joseph DeThomas, a professor at Penn State Universitys School of International Affairs, told PolitiFact that defining war solely based on formal declarations by Congress would exclude conflicts such as the Vietnam War, the Korean War and the Iraq War.\nThe Correlates of War Project, an academic project that collects war data, defines war as a conflict involving two organized armed forces that results in at least 1,000 battle-related casualties. Under this definition, Trump didnt start any wars, but neither did Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, said Robert Gulotty, an assistant political science professor at the University of Chicago.\nSays he defeated \"100% of the ISIS caliphate.\"\nThis is missing key context.\nTrump in October 2019 said that his administration was responsible for defeating \"100%\" of the ISIS caliphate. But weeks later, when he announced Islamic State leader Abu al-Baghdadis death, he walked that back, saying the figure was closer to 70%.\nExperts told PolitiFact that ISIS had been weakened significantly, but wasnt gone. They added that Trump largely built on President Barack Obama's long-devised strategy to fight the group.\n\"(ISIS) no longer has significant territorial holdings, and its top leader has been killed. It is weaker than when Trump came to office, organizationally and ideologically and territorially,\" Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign-policy specialist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, previously told PolitiFact. Trump deserves some credit for that, OHanlon said, but \"that was mostly due to the implementation of a strategy that he inherited.\"\nCiting a journal published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, The Washington Post reported in October 2020 that ISIS African affiliates had gained significant territory, recruits and firepower.\nRELATED: Fact-checking CPAC 2023 claims about the FBI, fentanyl, IRS\nRELATED: All of our fact-checks of Trump on the Truth-O-Meter",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check strongly supports the caption, with a high confidence score of 10.  The image clearly shows Donald Trump at a CPAC event in 2021, aligning with the caption's claim. However, the external check contradicts this, stating that there's no evidence of Trump launching a 2024 presidential campaign at the February 2021 CPAC. The external check's low confidence score (3) indicates a lack of definitive information to refute the caption entirely. This discrepancy necessitates a conservative approach. While the image visually supports the presence of Trump at CPAC 2021, the absence of external verification for the 2024 campaign launch casts doubt. The difference in confidence scores (10 vs 3) highlights this conflict. The visual evidence alone isn't sufficient to definitively confirm the campaign launch claim. Therefore, considering the low external validation and potential for error regarding the launch event, the caption is deemed out-of-context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's core elements (Trump at CPAC 2021), while external validation fails to confirm the 2024 campaign launch claim, resulting in a low overall confidence score and a determination of out-of-context."

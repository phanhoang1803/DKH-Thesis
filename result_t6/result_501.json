        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people have marched through the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to protest against President Nicolas Maduro.\nOpposition supporters, staging their largest rally for two years, called for Mr Maduro's removal.\nThey blame him for Venezuela's economic crisis and accuse the electoral commission of delaying a referendum that could shorten his stay in power.\nMr Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers.\nHe accuses the opposition of trying to stage a coup.\nThe opposition said close to a million people turned out for their march, dubbed the \"Takeover of Caracas\", but the government disputed the figures.\n\"We have shown to the world the importance of Venezuela and how much it wants change,\" said opposition politician Jesus Torrealba.\nDressed predominantly in white, they chanted \"we are going to bring down Maduro\".\nProtesters said they had enough of the policies of the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela.\n\"We are going to defeat hunger, crime, inflation and corruption. They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,\" Naty Gutierrez told Reuters news agency.\nA small group of protesters clashed with riot police as the peaceful rally ended.\n\"The nation has triumphed. They wanted to intimidate the people but the people are here,\" said Mr Maduro at a rally in central Caracas he said was attended by 30,000 people.\n\"We have defeated an attempted coup that tried to fill Venezuela and Caracas with violence, death,\" he said.\nIn the run-up to the march, a number of opposition politicians were detained.\nLast week, Daniel Ceballos of the opposition Popular Will party was returned to prison after having spent a year under house arrest awaiting trial on charges of rebellion.\nThe Interior Ministry said he was planning on escaping from house arrest to carry out acts of violence during Thursday's rally.\nMr Ceballos was one of the politicians arrested in 2014 over violent anti-government protests that swept through Venezuela at the time.\nForty-three people on both sides of the political divide where killed during those protests.\nPopular Will party activists Carlos Melo and Yon Goicoechea have also been arrested over the past few days, the first suspected of carrying a \"detonator cord\" and the latter of carrying explosives.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption states that the image depicts \"Government supporters at a political rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas.\"  Both internal and external validation checks support this claim.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check analyzes the image content and finds strong visual evidence supporting the caption. The image shows a large crowd of people holding flags and signs, many bearing the markings of apparent support for Maduro.  A large image of Maduro himself is prominently visible on one of the signs within the crowd. The overall atmosphere suggests a political rally. Although the image does not explicitly state the location, the internal check assesses it as consistent with the description of a rally in Caracas. The confidence score of 8 reflects the high degree of visual consistency but acknowledges the location cannot be definitively confirmed from the image itself.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation supports the caption's claim by referencing an external source that explicitly mentions \"Mr. Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers\" and clarifies that this rally took place in Caracas. This corroborates the location and the nature of the event described in the caption.  The confidence score of 8 indicates strong external support for the claim, but notes that external verification is limited to what is expressly stated in the referenced source, and might not capture the entire picture of the events.\n\nAgreement and Discrepancies:\nBoth internal and external checks agree that the image depicts supporters of Mr. Maduro at a rally. The internal check highlights that the image alone isn't definitive proof of the rally's location as Caracas, although it is highly suggestive. The external check provides explicit confirmation of the location (Caracas) and the presence of Maduro's supporters, resolving this uncertainty. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks.\n\nFinal Result:\nGiven the strong agreement between internal and external checks, and the relatively high confidence scores (both 8), the final assessment is that the caption is NOT out of context. The image content strongly suggests a political rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas, which is reinforced by the external source's confirmation of similar events in the same location. There are no substantial concerns regarding visual manipulation or miscontextualization.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the news caption. Internal analysis finds the image content highly consistent with a pro-Maduro rally in Caracas, while external evidence explicitly confirms a similar event in Caracas.  No major discrepancies were found."

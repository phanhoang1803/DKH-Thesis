However, that lawsuit was about a records request and compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) related to Clinton's use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state -- it had nothing to do with the 2012 attack in Benghazi, was not a \"trial,\" and did not involve any appearance by Clinton herself in court.\nA House Select Committee extensively investigated the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead in Libya and issued a lengthy report that found no wrongdoing on the part of Clinton in connection with that event:\nEnding one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead.\nThe 800-page report delivered a broad rebuke of the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department  and the officials who led them  for failing to grasp the acute security risks in Benghazi, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect.\nPrevious investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation. But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes directly addresses the claim made in the news caption.  While the caption states Hillary Clinton was \"'on trial' for Benghazi\", the Snopes article clarifies that she was involved in a court hearing related to a public records request, not a trial concerning Benghazi. The article supports the caption's assertion that this event occurred in June 2020 and that it was overshadowed by other news (the George Floyd protests). Therefore, the verdict is mostly true, though the use of the word 'trial' is inaccurate.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check correctly identifies that the image shows Hillary Clinton, but notes that the caption mentions Benghazi, which is not visually depicted in the image. This discrepancy is a key indicator of potential out-of-context information.  The external validation, using Snopes, confirms that while Hillary Clinton was indeed involved in a legal matter in June 2020, it was not a trial for Benghazi as the caption claims. The Snopes article clarifies that it involved a court hearing about a FOIA request related to her emails, not the Benghazi attacks.  Therefore, the caption's central claim – that Clinton was \"'on trial' for Benghazi\" – is inaccurate.  While the Snopes article supports that the event happened in June 2020 and was overshadowed by other news, the core inaccuracy of the caption's claim significantly undermines its accuracy. The difference between a \"court hearing\" and being \"on trial\" is substantial, highlighting a misrepresentation in the caption.  Both internal and external checks point to a significant issue with the caption's accuracy. The image's context is not directly reflected in the caption's core claim, making it misleading. While some temporal aspects of the caption are corroborated by the Snopes article, the misleading nature of the core claim outweighs the partially accurate temporal details.  The external source's high confidence score further strengthens the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  Based on this evidence, the caption is deemed out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks reveal significant discrepancies. The internal check flags the caption's mention of Benghazi, absent from the image.  The external check (Snopes) confirms that the legal matter was not a trial for Benghazi, but rather a hearing related to a FOIA request. This inaccuracy in the core claim, despite partially correct temporal context, indicates that the caption is out of context."

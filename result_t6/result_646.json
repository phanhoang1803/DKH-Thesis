        "title": "Tina Turners Famous Body Was a Mirage",
        "date": "2023-12-22T18:02:10",
        "content": "Tina Turner was a human being. Flesh, and blood. This can be hard to remember amid all the iconography: the Avedon and Warhol photos, the music videos, the Acid Queen, the mesmeric Aunty Entity, the biopic, the memes. Turners body was on display for half a century and subject to infinite misconceptions, some of which even she bought into. For far too long, she wrote in March 2023, I believed that my body was an untouchable and indestructible bastion. Its no wonder. Her body was an optical illusion.\nThe fashion designer Bob Mackie said Turner had the best body, with the longest legs, and she used it all. A month before she died, Turner said: I think Im as famous for my legs as much as my voice. I only had my legs on show so much as it made it much easier to dance. Then it became part of my style. When I was younger, I never felt confident about any part of my body. The long legs she called her workhorses were a mirage. Turner was 5-foot-4.\nTurners legs were larger than life because in her Hall of Fame heydays (she was inducted twice), men were a majority of music executives, critics and her fellow rockers. They misarticulated the dimensions of Turners body and soul from media platforms that told her her music was too Black to be pop and too white to be R.&B. Libidinous stereotypes leaped off the page, particularly in the 1970s. Rolling Stone described Turner as snake-snapping. Both Look and Playboy went with lioness in heat. The French magazine Maxipop used Tina Turner Super Sex! as its sole cover line. The rote tropes wrote themselves and functioned as carnival calls to come one, come all.\nTurners forerunners include the original rock star, Sister Rosetta Tharpe. But the clearest line is from Josephine Baker to Turner. Turners precursor performed her danse sauvage in Paris for years in a banana-adorned skirt. In 1975, Turner donned a thigh-baring zebra-print Mackie concoction that included a tail. The message: This is how you see my body, so Ill flip your gaze right back at you. In 2000, it was widely reported that Turner insured her breasts and face for $790,000 each. Turners voice was insured for $3.2 million, and her toned and glowing legs, the ones on which she danced in high heels for more than 50 years, were covered for $3 million.\nWhile these valuations placed Turner in the company of Marlene Dietrich and the famously leggy Betty Grable, any time a price is attached to the limbs of Black people, antebellum echoes are loud. She was, after all, born Anna Mae Bullock in the basement of a segregated hospital near the sharecropping community of Nutbush, Tenn. The kind of place where, before Turner turned 1, a man named Elbert Williams was abducted and shot to death, apparently for registering Black people to vote. Along with the ruby birthmark on her right arm, a perceived stain upon Anna Mae was a rumor that perhaps she didnt belong to her father at all. Richard was an overseer, so the family also worked an acre of their own crowded with cabbage and yams. She trudged through mud, picking sticky strawberries under her fathers watch. With muscles built on catfish and perch, she picked cotton, too, from its thorny bolls. Other token perks of Richards role: nice furniture and clean sheets on Anna Maes skin, always. All this early grit and grace emerge in the unique rasp of Turners vocals. As the British rocker Dame Skin said: She had wonderful phrasing. The way she would drop the note and then find the point of putting the gravel in there. Its quite a thing to have that gravel in your voice for a long time, and not destroy your vocal cords.\nRichard didnt like Anna Mae, and her mother, Zelma, didnt want her. Desperation and necessity were the parents of her invention. To tell the truth, Turner said in her 1986 autobiography, I havent received a real love almost ever in my life. She tore out the tight plaits of Black girlhood and pulled her hair into rugged ponytails. I was always up to something, she wrote. Running, moving.\nIn high school, Anna Mae ran up and down basketball courts as a forward, ran around homes as a part-time maid and by 17 she was in St. Louis running around its vibrant nightclub scene. There, she met Ike Turner. Upon realizing her singular vocals, charisma and spasms of ambition, Ike renamed Anna Mae Tina, inspired by Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, a Tarzan-esque comic-book heroine. The duo married in Tijuana in 1962, on the day she turned 23.\nBack in the States, where they were gigging, writing and recording, Turners eyes were described as flashing, yet she often performed behind sunglasses. From within whirls of fringe and sequin, Turner looked to be dancing on hot coals. She sang ferociously, as if for her freedom.\nIn 1976, Turner left Ike and his cocaine and his sherry and his guns. Finally escaped how he beat her  with fists, with phones, with shoes, with hangers. She couchsurfed and earned her keep by housecleaning. Already a Grammy winner, Turner performed at trade shows in ragged costumes and stomped stages on sore feet. There were no more broken jaws, though, or hematomas on her eyes. Only a fixation on the kind of life she knew could be hers.\nTurner became a solo pop star at 44. From there she walked tall. After a series of spectacular world tours that broke attendance records, Turner announced that she would retire. Ive done enough, she said in 2000 to an adoring crowd at Zurichs Letzigrund Stadium. I really should hang up my dancing shoes. Turner finally truly retired in 2009, after her 50th-anniversary tour. In her 70s, she suffered a stroke, cancer and renal failure, and received a kidney transplant. The donor was Erwin Bach, her new husband.\nBach was a German record executive 16 years her junior. The couple met for the first time at an airport in Cologne. I instantly felt an emotional connection, Turner wrote. I could have ignored what I felt  I could have listened to the ghost voices in my head telling me that I didnt look good that day, or that I shouldnt be thinking about romance because it never ends well. Instead, I listened to my heart. They were together for 27 years before marrying in 2013. It turns out that what love had to do with it was loving Anna Mae enough to become Tina. And loving Tina enough to show the world, and the man with whom she shared her one true marriage, all that might have withered to nothingness. Its physical/only logical, she sang in one of her biggest hits; she might have been alluding to the grueling work of giving us her all.\nTurners body is the only part of her that is gone. Living to see eight decades, the last three in a mansion on the shore of Lake Zurich, with the birthmarks of America in the rearview, has got to bring satisfaction. Its comforting to imagine her in an afterlife, legs their actual size, trim ankles crossed on an ottoman, eating strawberries, relishing sweetness. I think of her resting in the peace we often wish upon people but can rarely ever conjure.\nDanyel Smith is the Los Angeles-based author of Shine Bright: A Very Personal History of Black Women in Pop, chosen by Pitchfork as the best music book of 2022. Smith is also host of Black Girl Songbook, a podcast focused on the stories of Black women in music.\nTo say that Sinead OConnor never quite regained the musical heights of her 1987 debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, is not to slight the rest of her output, which contained jewels. There is no getting back to a record like that first one. It was in some sense literally scary: The label had to change the original cover art, which showed a bald OConnor hissing like a banshee cat, for the American release. In the version we saw, she looks down, arms crossed, mouth closed, vulnerable. The music had both sides of her in it.\nA fuzziness has tended to hang over the question of who produced The Lion and the Cobra. The process involved some drama. OConnor clashed with the label and dropped her first producer, Mick Glossop, highly respected and the person the label wanted. In the end, she produced the album largely by herself. But not entirely. There was a co-producer, an Irish engineer named Kevin Moloney, who worked on the first five U2 albums and Kate Bushs Hounds of Love. He and OConnor went to school at the same time in the Glenageary neighborhood of Dublin, where he attended an all-boys Catholic academy next to her all-girls Catholic school. But Moloney didnt know OConnor then, though they took the same bus.\nIn Asheville, N.C., this fall, Moloney sat in the control room of Citizen Studios, where he is the house producer, and hit play on The Lion and the Cobra. The first song is a ghost story called Jackie. A woman sings of her lover, who has failed to return from a fishing expedition. Youre on deep Irish literary sod, the western coast and the islands. Its the lament of Maurya in J.M. Synges play Riders to the Sea, grieving for all the men the ocean has taken from her, except that the creature singing through OConnor will not accept death. Hell be back sometime, she assures the men who deliver the news, laughing at you. At the end, her falsetto howls above the feedback. She starts the song as a plaintive young widow and ends it as a demon. Gets the old hairs going up, Moloney said.\nWhere did she get that? I asked. Those different registers?\nIt was all in her head, he said. She had these personas.\nAnd the words? Were they from an obscure Irish shanty she found in an old newspaper? Oh, no, she wrote it herself, Moloney said. Her lyrics were older than she was.\nMoloneys connection with OConnor came through U2s guitarist, the Edge (David Evans). In late 1985, the band was between albums, so Evans did a solo project, scoring a film. He recruited OConnor  who had just been signed to the English label Ensign Records  to sing on one tune, and Moloney engineered the session. OConnor was 18, with short dark hair.\nEnsign put her together with Glossop, who had just co-produced the Waterboys classic album This Is the Sea. But she spurned the results: Too pretty. Glossop remembered OConnor as reluctant to speak her mind in the studio, leading to a situation where small differences of opinion werent being addressed, leaving her alienated from the material. With characteristic careerist diplomacy, she called Glossop a [expletive] ol hippie (and derided U2, who possessed some claim to having discovered her, as fake rebels making bombastic music). Glossop recalled that when he ran into her at a club a couple of years later, she hugged him and apologized  which was a nice gesture, he told me.\nNobody has ever heard those first, abandoned tracks from The Lion and the Cobra. They put a big sound, a band sound around her, Moloney said, and she was disappearing in it. Glossop remembered it slightly differently. She had a rapport with her band, he said, and I recorded them as a band. But she was turning into a solo artist.\nShe was also pregnant, unbeknownst to Glossop (It would have been nice to know, he said). The father was the drummer in the band, John Reynolds, whom she had known for a month when they conceived. According to OConnors autobiography, Rememberings, the label pressured her to have an abortion, sending her to a doctor who lectured her on how much money the company had invested in her.\nOConnor not only insisted on keeping the baby; she also told the label that if it forced her to put out its version of the record, she would walk. They eventually caved, Moloney said. They told her, Make it your way. But with a limited budget.\nThats when she reached out to Moloney, in the spring of 1986, saying she needed someone she trusted. He started taking day trips to Oxford, where she was holed up in a rental house. We were in the living room, Moloney said. A bunch of couches and a bunch of underpaid, underloved musicians who were struggling big time.\nThere was a bit of a little communal hub, he said, always a few joints going around the room. Sinead loved her ganja. A lot of talking, and then somebody would start to play, and people would pick up instruments. And Sinead was, like, captain of the ship.\nWhen they got into the studio in London, Moloney turned the earlier, band-focused approach inside out like a sock. OConnors voice was allowed to dictate. The musicians worked around it.\nFor the song Jackie, he said, Sinead wanted to do all of those guitar parts herself. And she wanted to do it really late at night, when everybody else was gone home. She didnt feel good about her guitar playing. I got her to do this really distorted big sound, and then we layered it and layered it. It became this sort of seething. She was like, Look at me  Im Jimi Hendrix.\nThe most difficult challenge in recording OConnor, he said, was finding a microphone that could handle her dynamic range, with those whisper-to-scream effects she was famous for. Once we figured out the right way of capturing her vocals  an AKG C12 vintage tube mic  she did it really fast.\nI must have looked amazed  the vocals are so theatrical and swooping, OConnors pitch so precise, that I had envisioned endless takes  because Moloney said, as if to settle doubts, Within a couple of takes, it was done.\nThe jangly guitar opening of the third track, Jerusalem, played. I remember hearing her play this for the first time, Moloney said. I got it, knowing her background. OConnor was abused  psychologically, physically, sexually  by her mother, who died in a car accident, and by the Catholic Church. All the systems had failed her, Moloney said, that were supposed to protect her.\nIf he was right that he heard trauma in Jerusalem, the song lyrics also drip with erotic angst (I hope you do/what you said/when you swore). It introduces the records main preoccupation: love and sex as they intersect with power and pain.\nThe streams cross with greatest emotional force in the song Troy, one of the most beautiful and ambitious pieces of mid-1980s popular music. The track sticks out production-wise, with a powerful, surging orchestral arrangement (the product of OConnors collaboration with the musician Michael Clowes, who also played keyboards on the album).\nTheres a moment in the song when OConnor repeats the line, You shouldve left the light on. I had never given undue thought to what it meant. Something about tortured desire: If you had left the light on, I wouldnt have kissed you. But Moloney said it had a double meaning. When OConnor was punished as a child and made to sleep outside in the garden shed, her mother would turn off all of the lights in the house. There wouldnt be a light on for her, Moloney said.\nOConnor gave birth to her son, Jake, just weeks after Moloney finished the mixes. She told Glasgows Daily Record that although the baby had kicked when she sang in the studio, he slept now when the record came on. She was so happy, Moloney said with tears in his eyes. She said: Oh, my God, I cant believe I went through all of that and Ive arrived here with a record I love. Also, heres my baby! She had two babies in one year.\nJohn Jeremiah Sullivan is a contributing writer for the magazine who lives in North Carolina, where he co-founded the nonprofit research collective Third Person Project.\nIn 1998, the year that The Jerry Springer Show beat Oprah Winfrey in the ratings, Jerry Springer sat down and tried to imagine his own death. He assumed it would happen during a taping of his show, perhaps the one about the man who cut off his own penis. Springers body would go tumbling through the live studio audience that was always chanting Jer-ry! Jer-ry! A stripper would attempt to revive him, unsuccessfully. Springer would then appear before God, who would decide if he belonged in heaven or hell. And what would Springer, a German Jewish immigrant, say to this Christian God in defense of himself? I never planned to become the titan of trash, Springer wrote, describing this fever dream in his autobiography, Ringmaster!\nAfter all, Gerald Norman Springer was born in an underground bomb shelter in London during the Second World War, and arrived in New York by boat at age 5. In Kew Gardens, Queens, while his father sold stuffed animals on the street, Gerald fell in love with baseball and American politics. As an undergraduate at Tulane University in New Orleans, he rode the bus to Mississippi to register Black residents to vote, and later took a break from law school to work on Robert F. Kennedys presidential campaign. By 25, as a young attorney in Cincinnati, Springer ran for Congress as an antiwar candidate. He sounded like Bobby Kennedy, and kind of looked like him too, Jene Galvin, a close friend who met Springer around this time, told me. Springer lost, but was soon serving as a member of the citys council, and then mayor. He opened health clinics in low-income neighborhoods and negotiated the end of a transit strike. In other words, he was a decent guy. Sure, he enjoyed the spotlight of local politics, perhaps a little too much. But was this how it was all going to end  talking to a man who tried to flush his manhood down the toilet?\nHe knew where the road split, of course. After he had a failed run for governor in 1982, NBCs Ohio affiliate offered him the anchor chair. It sounded too fun to resist. Springer still got to talk about the issues, and ended up winning 10 regional Emmys in 10 years, including one for a special report that had him living on the streets as a homeless man for a week. The Jerry Springer Show, when it premiered in 1991, wasnt supposed to be what it ultimately became. He was meant to replace Phil Donahue. Springer started out with shows about the Waco siege and the Iran-contra scandal. But the ratings werent there. Thats when Richard Dominick, a veteran of supermarket tabloids that reported on aliens and toaster ovens possessed by the devil, was brought on as executive producer for a revamp.\nSpringer didnt fight it. He played along. He interviewed porn stars who set world records, child alcoholics, conjoined twins, people who self-amputated their limbs and married farm animals and their own cousins. Audiences were riveted. It turned out they also loved a good brawl. In 1994, Steve Wilkos, a Chicago policeman, had just finished a patrol shift when his buddy Mike told him about a side gig. The next day, Wilkos was playing referee during an episode of Springer that featured members of the Ku Klux Klan. Wilkos would eventually become the shows head of security, incurring more than a few battle wounds during his tenure: bites, kicks, a concussion from a chair thrown at his head, a sprained groin and multiple back injuries that resulted in two surgeries. By that point, the television audience had ballooned to eight million people.\nCatholic priests staged protests, and Chicagos City Council tried to get the show taken off the air. Springer tirelessly defended it, railing against what he saw as elitism. But privately he was more forthcoming. The show became stupid stuff, Galvin told me, and Jerry always described it as stupid stuff. He wasnt ashamed of it, made no excuses for it. But he knew what it was and didnt think it was something it wasnt.\nFriends say Springer stayed with the show for his family. Many of his relatives back in Germany had been killed in the Holocaust. There was a story Springer liked to tell about how his father kept a Chevrolet in the garage of his Queens apartment building long after he could no longer drive because he wanted to make sure he had a getaway plan should he need it. Springer was married by now, and he had a daughter with disabilities. Financial security had become important. It was a job for him, said Wilkos, who became a friend. But I think there was always an underlying desire in Jerry to get away from the show. The number one thing in his life was politics.\nSpringer tried to find his way back. In 2000 and 2004, he explored running for a Senate seat, spending $1 million and seven months on the latter campaign. He owned a private jet and crisscrossed the state of Ohio giving speeches and gauging support in areas many politicians didnt travel, tapping into the same audience that loved his show. He could go into what we today call Trump country and get the same people that Trump could get, said Galvin, who worked on both campaigns. At one point, it got so real that Wilkos, afraid he would soon be out of a job, got his real estate license. But each time the filing deadline approached, Springer wouldnt get in the race. Hed run up to the water, like on a beach, and then run back, Galvin said.\nSpringer decided that a political career wasnt possible so long as his show was on the air. He feared the public wouldnt be able to separate his political message from the spectacle he conducted on TV. So he stayed in his lane. He did Dancing With the Stars and hosted Americas Got Talent. In his autobiography, guessing what his obituary might say, he wrote, Springers death comes none too soon for those who saw him as the godfather of Western civilizations demise. In reality, his critics were kinder. They credited him with showing us the true might of the American populace and anticipating reality TV. You need look no further than Bravos popular Real Housewives franchise to see the legacy of his show  in Teresa Giudice flipping tables and chairs; in producers stepping in to break up catfights; in Mary, the churchgoing Salt Lake City housewife, who married her step-grandfather.\nSpringer hosted his show until 2018, long enough for him to see a reality star win the presidency, despite the daytime-TV tawdriness that surrounded the campaign. Springer was a fierce critic of President Donald Trump  Hillary Clinton belongs in the White House. Donald Trump belongs on my show, he tweeted  but he also saw it as an opening. Did he give up too soon? Was someone like Springer electable now? In 2017, not long before his show went off the air, Springer explored his final bid for office. He set his sights on the governorship of Ohio, the very race he lost in 1982 that resulted in his TV detour. He hosted fund-raisers, met with Democratic power brokers and joined union workers in a Labor Day march in support of a $15-per-hour minimum wage. I could be Trump without the racism, he told The Cincinnati Enquirer. But in the end, he backed away again. He was too old now, and he had to think of his family. The moment, as he saw it, had passed.\nIrina Aleksander is a contributing writer for the magazine. Her last article was about Oscar campaigns and the strategists who run them.\nIn the middle of a school day in 1943, Harry Belafonte walked into a Harlem movie theater and sat for a showing of the Humphrey Bogart World War II film Sahara. He struggled with undiagnosed dyslexia and was blind in one eye, difficulties that contributed to him skipping lessons and, eventually, dropping out of high school. The 16-year-old Belafonte was transfixed by Rex Ingram, a Black actor who played a Sudanese soldier. One scene  the camera zoomed in on Ingrams face as he suffocated a Nazi soldier  led the boy to enlist in the United States Navy.\nWorld War II forced Black servicemen into the most cruel American Catch-22: Risk death in Europe only to return home to a meager second-class citizenship reinforced through racial violence. Armed service turned some Black soldiers into intellectuals, though. Older servicemen passed young Belafonte political pamphlets. He had already had something of a political education back home, where his Jamaican-immigrant mother introduced him to the activist Marcus Garvey. Brothers helped him build on that by introducing him to W.E.B. Du Bois, whose 1940 autobiography, Dusk of Dawn, was given to him by a colleague. Belafonte learned how to find more books by the scholars in Du Boiss footnotes at the Chicago public library, where all he needed was his dog tags to work his way through new thinkers.\nAfter 18 months of service in the Navy, Belafonte returned home to Harlem. He eventually got work as a janitor in a few apartment buildings that his stepfather worked in, and a tenant gifted him two tickets to see the play Home Is the Hunter at the nearby historic American Negro Theater. Entranced by the community and collaborative spirit of the shows production, he decided to volunteer as a stagehand for the Theater, where he met his fellow actor and friend Sidney Poitier.\nHed soon go from stagehand to drama student at the New School to starring in Off Broadway productions. After a manager and nightclub owner named Monte Kay saw him singing in a production of Of Mice and Men (in a musical role that had been written to accommodate Belafontes talent), Belafonte secured a slot at the Royal Roost. On his first night singing there, he shared the stage with the jazz great Charlie Parker. That propelled him to a singing career in local clubs, where he could make as much as $350 a week. Eventually he began performing in the South, where the indignities of touring and lodging in segregated spaces set him on an activist path.\nBetween 1946 and 1960, Belafonte established himself as the first Black megastar. In 1954, he won a Tony Award for his performance in the Broadway musical John Murray Andersons Almanac. In the same year, he starred alongside Dorothy Dandridge in the movie musical Carmen Jones. Belafontes third album, Calypso, released in 1956, sold more than one million copies. He eventually became one of the highest-paid Black performers in American history.\nBelafontes star power and political awareness came together in his civil rights activism. After personally inviting Belafonte to hear a sermon of his at Harlems Abyssinian Baptist Church in 1956, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. requested private time with him. In a conversation that Belafonte described as lasting three hours but feeling like 20 minutes, he realized that he was in the presence of greatness. For the next dozen years, Belafonte made Kings mission his own.\nIn August 1964, James Forman, a young civil rights activist and leader at the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, reached out to Belafonte during the Freedom Summer. There was a problem: At the start of a large voter-registration drive aimed at registering Black Americans in Mississippi, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner disappeared. Forman informed Belafonte that he had a crisis on his hands: If the other volunteers ran scared, the Ku Klux Klan would be encouraged to believe that murder could extend segregations life. He needed money to house and feed the activists risking their lives for the franchise.\nBelafonte and Poitier boarded a small Cessna headed for Greenwood, Miss., carrying a black medical bag stuffed with $70,000 in small bills that he had raised. Belafonte joked that while the Klan might murder one famous Negro, theyd be unlikely to murder two, particularly the two most famous Black actors in the world. After their plane skidded onto the runway, they jumped into a beat-up jalopy and drove off into the night, with the Klan trailing them in pickups. And like a righteous Stagolee, once they were safe, Belafonte entered a barn filled with volunteers and sang his hit The Banana Boat Song, with its famous refrain  Day-o, day-o  replaced by Freeeedom, Freeeeedoooom, before opening the black bag and dumping tens of thousands of dollars onto a table.\nSomehow, Belafonte managed to juggle such radical activism with broad mainstream appeal throughout his career. He understood that show business could be as good a tool in the fight against segregation as money. In February 1968, he took over for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show for one week. At the time, televisions all across America would be tuned into Johnny Carson five nights a week. Belafonte seized upon that ubiquity, turning the broadcast into the most integrated show in America, a front in the fight for Black rights. Belafonte the artist and autodidact, who could riff extemporaneously on the work of contemporaries like the filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo (The Battle of Algiers) and the writer Gabriel Garca Mrquez, put his skills as an interviewer on full display. He called his week on the show a sit-in; leaning on his extensive Rolodex, he brought some impressive guests to help him, including Aretha Franklin, Wilt Chamberlain, Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. King.\nBelafonte didnt just invite them on as guests  they were friends  and in talking to them on air, he was beaming Black camaraderie and politics right into peoples homes. He foregrounded that sense of intimacy by airing something special: footage of himself and his family on vacation. And for a moment, the face of a beautiful and smiling Black man was the last image America saw before it went to sleep.\nReginald Dwayne Betts is the founding chief executive of Freedom Reads and a contributing writer for the magazine. He last wrote about Elijah Gomez, who was shot while walking home from school.\nBoy, the movies can be cruel. Even if your timing is perfect and youve got a swear-to-God starriness about you, once somebody puts you on the poster for something called One Million Years B.C. looking 50 feet tall and dressed in wild-woman rags  rags youve successfully managed to fill out  theres just no going back. Youre a bombshell now, an offer you cant defuse. This was 1966. Raquel Welch was 26 and never seemed to stop working, in junk mostly even though nothing about her footed that particular bill. The daughter of a Bolivian aeronautical engineer, she had come to Hollywood after doing weather forecasts in San Diego, her hometown. (Tejada was her maiden name.) That kitschy B movie (kitschy hit B movie) helped make an eternal item of her. For nearly five decades, Welch was assigned a sex symbol lane, and she filled that out too.\nWhen Playboy published its 100 Sexiest Stars of the 20th Century, she was third, equidistant between Marilyn Monroe and Cindy Crawford. That was 1998. By then, Welch had already made her peace. She had put out the Raquel: The Raquel Welch Total Beauty and Fitness Program video at 44, her hair short and wet look glamorous, her bathing suits busy, her attitude serene. (Lets get in shape, she coos.) She had been on Broadway a couple of times, twice replacing Lauren Bacall in Woman of the Year, a proto-feminist romantic comedy role that Katharine Hepburn made classic, and later taking over for Julie Andrews in the musical gender farce Victor/Victoria. Ideal vehicles for the continental sharpness of her West Coast diction and comic timing whose speed nobody ever bothered to clock; occasions, too, to consider lanes not completely filled.\nIn this, she had a soul mate. Back in the old exploitation-film days, very occasionally, a producer would have the good idea to match what Welch had with another use what youve got star. In 100 Rifles, it was Jim Brown. This was 1969, and a dud of a western became about the time two pinups  her, reluctant; him, ready  found themselves pinned to each other.\nBrown had already quit his running-back job more or less from the set of The Dirty Dozen, one of the biggest movies of 1967. He was 30 and still in the prime of his football career, maybe the best career of just about anybody to enter the N.F.L. But he didnt like it when the Browns owner, Art Modell, threatened to fine him for missing training camp. He didnt like the way the rest of front-office football treated him, either. He was more than a body that the Browns owned and that the coach Paul Brown controlled. Paul and the other coaches didnt like this about my attitude, didnt like that, Brown wrote in his 1989 memoir, Out of Bounds. But they loved the damn performance. He went on: If my mind was limited to football, per the desires of the Cleveland Browns staff  what type of man would that make me? My attitude was shaped by personal conviction. It was shaped by society and my role in that society. It was shaped by being Black in America in the 1950s. And if it wasnt for that attitude that people spoke of, I never would have made it to the Cleveland Browns.\nStill, he really did dig performing. And even though he couldnt deliver a line as smoothly or as confidently as he could sail to the end zone, Brown definitely had something. There was a notion back then that he could be the new John Wayne, but he didnt carry many westerns. Instead, he led a vanguard of virility during what got called the blaxploitation era, in which the movies were contemporary and most of the heroes thrived outside the system. Brown was cool, passive yet never a complete blank, the rare beefcake whose stolidity has soul.\nIt shouldnt have been radical, putting this sexy, polemical Negro in a movie with a white woman, as Welch was perceived as simply being. The radical part wasnt just their being in the same movie. They were in each others arms. They were in the same bed. For the last 30 minutes of 100 Rifles, theyre supposed to be a couple.\nA blurb of the plot would go something like this: Arizona sheriff chases part-Native American bandit to Mexico, gets mixed up in revolution. Burt Reynolds is the bandit. The revolutionaries leader is Welch. Brown plays the sheriff. And after a triumphant sacking of the Mexican generals ample headquarters, the swaggering sheriff finds himself alone with the comely revolutionary.\nIts about 70 minutes in, and Browns shirtless for the first time. (A blaxploitation movie would never make you wait that long.) Welch has just bandaged his gash. For his solidarity, she thanks him with a kiss. And a peephole is mistaken for a door: He grabs her; she puts up violent resistance. No, she begs, not like this. He reconsiders and releases her. Shes attracted to him, but what she wont be is manhandled. He gathers as much and proceeds to gently unlace her top. She turns around. Their lips meet before they tumble onto a bed, whereupon Welch holds her mouth in an ecstatic o. From all the way over here in 2023, this encounter probably looks like what it is: a timidly shot, badly lit, vaguely committed love scene. But in 1969, just two years after Sidney Poitier caused a national sensation as an angelic doctor engaged to a white girl, you were still likelier to see a Black man unlace some white mans shoe. Brown writhing on top of Welch? Welch cooking him dinner and telling him shes his? Huge deal.\nThe movie knows this, because after a climactic showdown with the military, Welchs character turns up dead  nominally martyred for her people but, really, murdered for the American sin of bonking a Negro (I suppose for patching him up, loving and feeding him too). But the climate was changing. Audiences hungered to see erotic taboos smashed. Black audiences hungered to see Black people smashing. The more absurd, the better. (That very spring, Dionne Warwick made plantation love to Irelands Stephen Boyd  in Slaves.)\nThe 100 Rifles shoot itself was fraught between Welch and Brown. Burt Reynolds claimed he was their referee. Brown didnt dispute that a ref was necessary. The thing I wanted to avoid most was any suggestion that I was coming on to her, he said at the time. So I withdrew. Before the films release, Welch concurred that things were tense. Maybe it was because Tom Gries, the director, wanted to shoot that sex scene on the first day of production. There was no time for icing  and it made it difficult for me, she told Army Archerd in Variety. She remembered being feisty; Brown, she claimed, was very forceful. Welch died on Feb. 15, two days before Brown turned 87. By the middle of May, he was gone, too. 100 Rifles is the only time her lane merged with his. In theaters, the movie was a howler. But in my living room, it had become newly poignant. These two symbols of sex, two movie stars who had what, for a screen art, constitutes true talent: They were hypnotically, outrageously watchable. The angles of her face, the warmth in his eyes, her curves, his hands  flavor for the eye. Once, there they were, making a tender, visceral connection, two pinups, pinning us to them.\nWesley Morris is a critic at large for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine. He is the only person to have won the Pulitzer Prize for criticism twice.\nIt could sound like an odd refrain  I never felt like I fit in anywhere  coming from someone who, viewed perhaps over the rim of a martini glass, could look like the coolest guy in the room. He was suave, handsome, married to a glamorous actress. And he had a seemingly renewable lode of gold records, so many that in the summer of 1970, Newsweek put him on its cover, as if to say, Here is the face of popular music.\nAnd yet Burt Bacharach was something of a misfit, because the songs he composed sounded nothing like what was hip at the time, not like the Beatles, not like Motown, not like Dylan, the Stones, the Doors, the Dead. If anything, they were an antidote to all that. Think of them: songs like What the World Needs Now Is Love, I Say a Little Prayer, Raindrops Keep Fallin on My Head  all abundantly tuneful, proudly orchestral, mercurially rhythmic and not a single one with a loud electric guitar. Even the edgier songs, like the stately Walk On By, were clean and polished. If Tiffany boxes played music, this might have been what emerged.\nEvery true artist probably feels like an outsider at some point, but Bacharach seemed born for the role. He grew up a Jewish kid in a mostly Catholic neighborhood in Forest Hills, Queens. He wanted to be an athlete like his father, who lettered in four sports in college and played professional basketball before professional sports was even much of a thing. But his growth spurt came late, and he was always too small. In high school, he bombed out at just about everything else  he ranked 360th out of 372 students in his class. But there was a piano in the house, and it was his mother, an amateur singer, who encouraged him to take lessons. Finally, here was something he could play competitively.\nWhen he decided to have a go at songwriting, in his 20s, the world started bending away from him again. He loved jazz, and the classical composers Debussy and Ravel, but a tectonic shift was happening in popular music, to rock n roll, for which Bacharach had little affinity, especially in its formative years. A lot of those songs consisted of just three chords, C to F to G, he wrote in his 2013 memoir, Anyone Who Had a Heart. If they had thrown in a C major seventh, that would have been a lot more interesting. Hed land a B-side here or an A-side there, but dozens of other songs went unrecorded, unheard, unloved. They were too old-fashioned or too jazzy, tried too hard or not hard enough. Some years later, when he did achieve what seemed a composers dream  a song recorded by Frank Sinatra  the rhythm had been changed from a waltz to the squared-off 4/4, which was considered more palatable to the average listener. But to Bacharach it ruined the song, if for no other reason than it wasnt how he heard it in his head. Sinatra even told a mutual friend that Bacharach was a lousy writer.\nBacharach might have remained a journeyman composer if he hadnt found, in Hal David, a lyricist who could match the growing maturity of his melodies, and Marie Dionne Warrick (later of course Dionne Warwick), a 20-year-old with a Maserati of a voice, a compelling combination of flash and finesse. Now Bacharach could write whatever he wanted and not worry that it would be changed or that a singer couldnt deliver it, and the troika connected right off the bat with Dont Make Me Over. Written mostly in the very unusual (for a pop song) 12/8 time, the song had a money line that came to be a feminist entreaty but could have also served as Bacharachs own: Accept me for what I am/Accept me for the things that I do.\nThe hits  by Warwick, Dusty Springfield, Gene Pitney, et al.  started to flow, and Bacharach became known as one of pops most stickling perfectionists. In the recording studio, Burt would always ask for one more take, Warwick, now 83, told me recently. Then one would turn into 90,000, and wed end up using the first one anyway.\nStill, Bacharach often found himself composing against the current. When the rock band Love recorded his and Davids My Little Red Book, they simplified the harmony (or, as a rock-musician friend of mine said, They took out the fruity chords). On Broadway, Bacharach and Davids musical, Promises, Promises, had a title song that lit warning flares for singers in practically every measure: intervals that crept or leapt, multiple time-signature changes. Jerry Orbach, who had the lead role, told Bacharach, Youre breaking my back every night with that song. Rather than make any changes, Bacharach brought in Warwick to coach Orbach. (Her advice on how to sing it? Very carefully, she told me.) Orbach, who was in danger of losing his job, not only got onboard but also won a Tony Award for his performance. Promises, Promises would be a major influence on the melodious Sondheim masterpiece Company. Even Sinatra came around; he asked Bacharach to write an entire album for him. But it never happened. Bacharach was simply too busy.\nRob Hoerburger is the copy chief of the magazine and the author of the novel Why Do Birds. He has contributed to The Lives They Lived 18 times.\nHard as it is to remember, Steve Harwell and his band, Smash Mouth, were famous before Shrek. Before the 2001 animated comedy made nearly $500 million at the box office, the band from San Jose, Calif., had already ascended from the bog of alt-rock aspirants hoping to cash in on the craze. Their debut album, Fush Yu Mang, went double platinum, and in 1999 their monstrously successful single All Star, which overwhelmed pop radio, was featured in several movie soundtracks and helped the album on which it appeared, Astro Lounge, sell millions of copies. But it took Shrek to turn All Star into a cultural phenomenon.\nHarwell founded Smash Mouth after quitting a rap group. He was the new bands lead singer despite being an unremarkable vocalist: His voice was a blunt, somewhat nasally and abrasive instrument, but it was also inoffensive, even a little goofy. It was perhaps the only kind of voice that could pull off a song like All Star, an anthem for outcasts and those bewildered by their own mediocrity. Sooome-BODY once told me, the song begins, Harwell already straining against the limits of his capabilities, the world is gonna roll me. I aint the sharpest tool in the shed.\nIm not going to toot my own horn, he told Rolling Stone in a 2019 oral history chronicling the conception of Smash Mouths greatest hit, but nobody else could have sang that song. He was right. Harwells sun-fried vocals  you can hear the Bay Area slacker in him  made the song indelible. All Star did not need a talented singer to become a huge hit. It needed someone who could sell slackerdom as something not only appealing but aspirational  the stuff rock stars are made of.\nTheres a video for this song. It features Harwell  wearing Oakley-style sunglasses with a thin chin-strap beard framing his cherubic face, his hair spiked with gel  but it has faded into the cultural ether, overtaken by Shrek two years later. The movies opening introduces us to its title character, the disgusting but happy ogre with, strangely, a Scottish accent, through a montage set to All Star. Harwell sings along as Shrek showers in mud, brushes his teeth with a bug and kills a fish with his farts  a gleeful outsider, and a repulsive one at that. The movie gave All Star a second life, cementing it in American pop-music history  and leashing Harwell to the image of Shrek.\nAt the dawn of Web 2.0, social media allowed audiences to pulp pop culture and use it as the raw material for a new currency: memes. Shrek pried All Star out of the bands hands and delivered it to an adoring public to do with it what they would. YouTube was lousy with covers and parodies. People put the song in the mouths of everyone from Kermit the Frog to Mario. At the height of mash-up culture, people started splicing All Star into other popular songs by the likes of Modest Mouse and Nirvana. By 2013, an entire Reddit community dedicated to All Star memes existed. In 2017, Jimmy Fallon did a Star Wars-based cover, using clips from the various movies so that the franchises cast appeared to perform the song as an ensemble. Harwell might have thought that only he could have brought All Star to life, but his voice had now been replaced by another  the internets.\nThough the bands Twitter account aggressively protected its legacy, Harwell himself rarely spoke ill of Shrek or the way the movie altered the songs trajectory. In tweets, he appeared reliably cheery, whether he was supporting trans rights or posing in photos with his friend Guy Fieri, whom the internet jokingly confused him with. He mostly maintained this affable front despite suffering a devastating blow in 2001: The death of his baby son, Presley, due to complications from leukemia. Though he continued touring and making albums with Smash Mouth, he struggled with alcoholism and its physical toll in the years after that loss. That struggles effects were on display in a chaotic performance in October 2021. As the band dealt with a faulty speaker setup, Harwell swayed back and forth, threatened to harm an audience members family and at one point gave the Nazi salute. Shortly thereafter, he quit the band.\nEver since I was a kid, he told fans in a farewell, I dreamed of being a rock star and performing in front of sold-out arenas and have been so fortunate to live out that dream. But if Harwell had the privilege of being a rock star, he was among the first people to confront the roles diminished status in the age of social media. That must have been a wildly alienating first: the experience of having a song that you made famous through your voice and your performance not belong to you anymore  to have a cartoon character supersede you as your creations avatar in the world.\nIsmail Muhammad is a story editor for the magazine.

Efficiency. At 40, she could reap the local connections she made in the previous decade, when she volunteered for the Junior League of Phoenix, a womens social club, while she took care of her three young sons and her husband built his career at a prominent law firm. Running as a Republican, OConnor distanced herself from the feminist movement that was beginning to change (and threaten) middle-class America. I come to you with my bra and wedding ring on, she assured an audience at the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs in Phoenix.\nTwo years later, OConnor rose to Senate majority leader and had to manage the debate in Arizona over whether to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, the state-by-state effort to enshrine sex equality in the Constitution. OConnors conservative political allies, including her friend Senator Barry M. Goldwater, opposed the E.R.A. In the Judiciary Committee of the Arizona Senate, OConnor supported sending the amendment to the floor for a vote by the full chamber. But when she lost in committee, she shifted.\nOConnor proposed, as an alternative to the E.R.A., taking off the books hundreds of Arizona statutes that discriminated against women in remarkably direct ways, like requiring a wife to have the permission of her husband to buy a car. When she first joined the Legislature, she tried to eliminate such provisions and got nowhere, according to First, a biography by Evan Thomas. But now OConnor saw that her colleagues were ready to make laws gender neutral, and a bill to amend more than 400 of them passed easily.\nEight years later, after OConnor became a state appellate judge, President Ronald Reagan had his first chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice. OConnor had no experience in federal law. But Reagan campaigned on a promise to choose the nations first female justice.\nOConnors soothing moderation endeared her to the powerful men advising the president. Goldwater called Reagan on her behalf. Justice William H. Rehnquist, OConnors classmate from Stanford Law School and former beau, put in a word for her. When the attorney general sent two staff members to Phoenix to vet OConnor in late June 1981, she read the room correctly and said she found abortion personally repugnant  without tipping her hand on how she would vote on the issue  and then pulled off an elegant salmon mousse for lunch on a hot summers day.\nThe Senate confirmed OConnor unanimously that September. One Republican hope for her was that she would be able to assemble unlikely coalitions for conservative outcomes, a counterpart to Justice William J. Brennan Jr., the liberal known for masterminding winning majorities. But OConnor became the most powerful justice of her era for a different reason. She was the fifth vote  the one who could dictate the reasoning, in case after case, because she was essential.\nOConnor disliked the term swing justice. She didnt oscillate from right to left so much as hew to her idea of the middle. Anthony Kennedy swung from one side to the other with enthusiasm, says the Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, speaking of OConnors fellow Reagan appointee. She would split the difference.\nOConnor offered no grand theory. She concentrated on the facts of each case, giving herself room to tack in a different direction the next time. She cared about the impact of her rulings, but sometimes her approach vexed nearly everyone. In 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, OConnor helped reaffirm the core of Roe v. Wade by joining a majority that adopted a test she came up with years earlier: The state could regulate abortion as long as a law did not impose an undue burden on a womans abortion decision. Justice Antonin Scalia pounced on the vagueness of the standard  what counted as undue?  calling it a shell game. Over time, abortion rights advocates became frustrated, too, as courts permitted restrictions even when they diminished access to abortion in large areas of the country.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, as conservative and liberal justices increasingly outlined and debated competing and overarching philosophies  originalism, living constitutionalism  OConnor did not join them or change her ways. Appropriately for a pragmatist, says John Harrison, a law professor at the University of Virginia, she felt confident about being one without feeling the need to provide a theoretical justification for her pragmatism.\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, who retired last year, aligned with OConnor in closely considering the potential impact of a ruling. We might not have always agreed, but we did have a similar outlook, he said, putting two other justices from bygone eras, John Marshall and David H. Souter, in the same category. Sandra was a person who tried to get other people to get together, to be practical, to understand that consequences matter, to understand that the court is one of our governing institutions  not the only one and not always the most important one  thats part of how we keep 300-something million people together. She understood that.\nPhotograph: National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; gift of the Portrait Project, Inc.\nEmily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the Truman Capote fellow for creative writing and law at Yale Law School.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation provides a confidence score of 10 and concludes that the caption is accurate because it aligns with the image's depiction of Warwick Davis taking a selfie with the Wicked cast. However, the external validation fails to provide any supporting evidence and yields a confidence score of 0. This discrepancy necessitates a careful examination of both checks. The internal check is based solely on the image's content and the caption's description, focusing only on the presence of Warwick Davis and the context of a Wicked cast photo. It doesn't offer any external verification to support the claim about 'Troy' managing social media accounts.  There is no mention of 'Troy' in the image, making the claim unsubstantiated. The external validation, on the other hand, attempts to find external sources to corroborate the specific details mentioned in the caption, namely, the existence of a 'Troy' managing social media accounts for Wicked, and the routine involvement of photographing celebrities. It fails to find such corroboration. The external check's inability to confirm this crucial detail casts doubt on the caption's accuracy.  Since the external validation offers no support and the internal validation has limitations, we must prioritize the absence of external evidence.  The image is self-explanatory, showing Warwick Davis with the Wicked cast. The addition of 'Troy' and his alleged social media management role adds a detail not visually supported. The lack of external verification of this supplementary detail makes the caption potentially misleading or incomplete, although the core visual element (Warwick Davis with the cast) is undeniably true. In conclusion, there's sufficient evidence to deem the caption partially inaccurate, thereby making it out of context. Therefore, the overall confidence score is lowered to 5, reflecting uncertainty due to the conflicting results.",

While the image shows buses, it does not offer direct evidence that they contained paid fake protesters or that their destination was an anti-Trump protest. Therefore, based solely on the visual content, one cannot confidently confirm the claim. However, the presence of multiple buses in the context of Austin, Texas, aligns partially with the claim.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the image depicts buses carrying paid fake protesters to anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.  Internal validation, based solely on the image, shows a cluster of buses parked near an apartment building. While consistent with the caption in showing buses, the image provides no evidence confirming the claim of paid protesters or their intended destination for an anti-Trump protest. The internal check acknowledges this limitation, giving a relatively low confidence score (8) and a 'True' verdict (meaning the caption might be true but the image doesn't prove it).  However, external validation provides strong evidence contradicting the caption. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, rates the claim as false.  They provide evidence that the buses in question were related to the Tableau Conference, not to any political protests.  This external evidence casts serious doubt on the original caption, with a confidence score of 8 and a 'False' verdict.  The discrepancy between internal and external checks lies in the image's inherent ambiguity. The image shows buses, which are consistent with the claim but doesn't provide any detail about who was inside the buses and where they were going. This ambiguity makes the internal check inconclusive. The decisive evidence comes from the external fact-check, which directly refutes the claim by providing evidence that the buses were involved in a completely unrelated event.  Therefore, the external evidence is more compelling, and the caption is considered out of context. Considering the strong external evidence and the inherent ambiguity in the image, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context (OOC: True) with a high confidence score (9). The buses in the picture were indeed present in Austin, Texas around the time of the protests, but the connection to paid protestors is completely unfounded and refuted by credible external sources. There is no visual evidence within the image to support or refute claims of the passengers' identities and their political agendas.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation found the image consistent with the claim in a weak sense (showing buses), but lacked sufficient evidence to confirm it. External validation strongly refutes the claim, identifying the buses as belonging to an unrelated event.  The external evidence is considered decisive, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

    "explanation": "The internal validation strongly supports the caption, showing high confidence in the image accurately depicting a meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels, consistent with the context of Brexit negotiations.  However, the external validation reveals a significant discrepancy. The external source, while mentioning Brexit negotiations, does not explicitly confirm a meeting between these two leaders. This lack of direct corroboration from an external source undermines the caption's claim, despite the strong internal validation. The discrepancy arises from the external source's focus on the lack of new proposals from the UK, rather than on a specific meeting between Johnson and von der Leyen. This leads to a lower overall confidence score and a conclusion of out-of-context.  To resolve this discrepancy, further investigation is needed.  Additional reliable sources confirming the meeting between the two leaders in Brussels would be required to strengthen the credibility of the caption.  Without such external evidence, we must rely on a conservative assessment. The internal validation, while convincing on its own, cannot override the lack of explicit confirmation from an external source. The image itself is internally consistent; there is no visual tampering or miscontextualization evident. The flags and the setting strongly suggest a meeting between the two leaders on Brexit. However, the lack of external evidence to explicitly confirm the event described in the caption leads to a lower confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",

However, external validation fails to confirm this specific meeting, creating a significant discrepancy.

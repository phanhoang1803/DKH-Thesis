        "content": "The US has called for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia's Tigray region.\n\"Credible reports\" had emerged of their involvement in human rights abuses, including sexual violence and looting, the state department said.\nThis is its first statement on the conflict since the Joe Biden administration took office last week.\nBoth the Eritrean and Ethiopian governments deny that Eritrean forces are in Tigray, which borders Eritrea.\nEritrea is a highly militarised one-party state ruled by President Isaias Afwerki since 1993.\nThousands of people have been killed and about two million people, or one-third of Tigray's population, have fled their homes since conflict broke out in early November.\nDialogue between the Ethiopian government and Tigrayans was \"essential\", and humanitarian aid needed to be \"mobilised\" immediately because of \"credible reports\" that hundreds of thousands of people may starve to death, the US state department said.\nEritrea appeared to have launched artillery attacks from its side of the border, and had troops in Tigray, though the exact number was unclear, it said.\n\"The United States has made clear its position that all Eritrean troops need to leave Tigray immediately, given credible reports of looting, sexual violence, assaults in refugee camps and other human rights abuses.\n\"There is also evidence of Eritrean soldiers forcibly returning Eritrean refugees from Tigray to Eritrea,\" it added in a statement.\nNearly 100,000 Eritreans had lived in four camps in Tigray after fleeing political persecution and military conscription over the last decade.\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for restoring relations with Mr Isaias' government, almost two decades after the two nations fought a border in Tigray that left up to 100,000 people dead.\nLast month, Mr Abiy admitted that Eritrea had hosted armed Ethiopian troops who had retreated to its territory after the TPLF captured their bases in Tigray in early November.\nHowever, he did not acknowledge that Eritrean troops had entered Tigray to bolster the fight against the TPLF.\n'Residual fighting continues'\nThe TPLF had been the ruling party in Tigray for almost three decades. It said it had seized the military bases in a \"pre-emptive strike\" following a breakdown in relations with Mr Abiy's government.\nMr Abiy responded by ordering air strikes and a ground offensive to oust the TPLF from power. He declared the operation over after the capture of the regional capital, Mekelle, at the end of November.\nHe rejected calls for mediation to end the conflict, saying Ethiopia would not accept foreign interference in its affairs.\nThe US said \"residual fighting\" was still taking place, and there was the risk of \"a long-running insurgency in Tigray that will destabilise northern Ethiopia and worsen ethnic tensions throughout the country\".\n\"That could not only put at risk US-endorsed democratic and other reforms by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed,\" the statement said.\n\"It could also exacerbate instability in neighbouring Somalia, from where Ethiopia has already withdrawn some of its peacekeeping forces, and even in Sudan, where the transitional government is already grappling with serious problems.\"",

The external check provides no information to support or refute the caption, resulting in a confidence score of 0.  The discrepancy stems from the lack of external evidence, rendering any verification based solely on visual elements inconclusive. Since neither internal nor external validation offers strong support, the caption is deemed out of context. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty surrounding the accuracy of the caption due to the limited verifiable information.",

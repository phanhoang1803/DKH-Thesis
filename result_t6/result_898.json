    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows some confidence in the caption's accuracy because the image clearly depicts a metro that crashed into a whale tail artwork. However, the location is not explicitly mentioned in the image and the caption's claim about the specific subway station needs external verification.  The external validation check reveals a significant lack of corroborating evidence. While train derailments are possible, the precise details of the event (metro crashing through a stop block, landing on a specific whale tail artwork at a named station) are highly unusual and lack supporting evidence online. This discrepancy between internal visual evidence and external fact-checking casts doubt on the caption's accuracy. The unusual nature of the event makes it less likely to be widely documented unless it were a major news event, which would be easy to find evidence for.   The internal confidence score is higher due to the clear visual evidence within the image itself.  However, this is significantly offset by the lack of corroborating information and the unusual specifics presented in the caption that have not been independently confirmed.  The absence of external evidence weakens the credibility of the location and precise details of the accident, even though the central event (a train impacting an artwork) is visually confirmed. The overall assessment leans toward the caption being out of context due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the key details of the location and specifics of the accident, despite the internal visual validation.  Therefore, the confidence score reflects this uncertainty, and the OOC flag is set to true due to the inability to fully verify the caption's claims.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows visual agreement with the core event (train impacting artwork). External validation finds no supporting evidence for the specific location and details of the accident, raising concerns about the caption's accuracy. Discrepancy between internal visual evidence and the lack of external corroboration leads to a conclusion of out-of-context."

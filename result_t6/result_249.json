While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that several local news outlets reported on a rare purple lobster caught in Maine in late October 2019.  Source 1 directly addresses this claim, stating that several local news outlets *did* report on a purported purple lobster caught by a Maine lobsterman. However, the source then reveals that the images and reports were based on a digitally manipulated image, a hoax created and later admitted to by the lobsterman. While the news outlets reported it, the underlying facts of the event were false.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence (confidence_score: 10) that the caption is consistent with the image. The image shows a purple lobster, aligning with the caption's mention of a rare purple lobster caught in Maine.  However, the external validation reveals a crucial discrepancy (confidence_score: 8).  The external check found evidence suggesting the image and initial news reports were based on a digitally manipulated image, a hoax. While several local news outlets did report on the story, the underlying fact of a naturally occurring purple lobster in Maine was false.  This directly contradicts the caption's implication that the purple lobster's existence was a genuine and verifiable event. The external check's lower confidence score reflects some uncertainty inherent in relying on a single source to definitively debunk multiple news reports. However, the source provides concrete evidence, including the identification of the creator of the hoax image and the pathway of the image's spread from a private Facebook group to local news outlets. This substantial evidence outweighs the internal consistency, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The visual evidence alone, while supporting the internal assessment, cannot override the confirmed evidence of digital manipulation and subsequent false reporting.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's consistency with the image. However, external validation reveals the image is digitally manipulated, making the caption's claim of a naturally occurring rare purple lobster in Maine false. Therefore, the caption is judged to be out of context."

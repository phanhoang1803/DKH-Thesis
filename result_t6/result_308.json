        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check found partial support for the caption, noting that the image shows the Annabelle doll, aligning with the caption's mention of the doll. However, it also points out the image does not show the doll escaping from a museum, leaving this part of the caption unsupported.  The external validation check, relying on Snopes and a statement by Tony Spera, definitively refutes the claim of the doll's escape from a Connecticut museum, stating the rumor is false and the doll never left the museum.  The external check has a higher confidence score and provides direct evidence contradicting the caption's core claim.  Therefore, the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context. The image merely shows the doll; it does not support the narrative of an escape. The external evidence conclusively demonstrates the falsity of the escape claim. The discrepancy arises from the caption's ambiguity; while it correctly identifies the doll, it falsely asserts the event of the escape. The high confidence score (10) reflects the strong external evidence refuting the claim and the internal analysis identifying the caption's unsupported assertion.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption by identifying the Annabelle doll. However, external validation strongly refutes the claim of the doll's escape, concluding the caption is out of context. The discrepancy is resolved by prioritizing the strong external evidence contradicting the core claim."

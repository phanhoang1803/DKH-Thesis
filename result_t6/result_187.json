Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map  with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\nCruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernies base,\" implied  if not directly asserted  that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\nThis is Bernies base  the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment  no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\nKimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the original news caption is out of context. The internal check points out that the image shows only one person, and it doesn't specify whether that person is a Bernie Sanders supporter. The caption claims that the video shows supporters of Sanders failing to identify countries, but this image alone cannot verify that claim. The external check reinforces this by stating that the video featured randomly selected individuals, not specifically identified Sanders supporters.  Furthermore, the video's context suggests a comedic segment where even self-identified Republicans faced similar challenges.  Therefore, the image presented is insufficient to verify the caption's claim about Bernie Sanders supporters.  The visual evidence shows a single individual in front of a world map. This is not enough to confirm or deny the statement made in the caption.  The internal check recognizes that the image lacks information to support the claim that the individual is a Bernie Sanders supporter.  The external check provides further evidence that the video the image was extracted from did not exclusively feature Bernie Sanders supporters, undermining the caption's specificity. Consequently, the discrepancies arise because the caption makes a claim (Bernie Sanders supporters' inability to identify countries) which the visual evidence cannot corroborate, and the external information refutes. The image provides insufficient visual evidence to support the caption's assertion. Even if the video showed multiple people, the lack of confirmation that these individuals were specifically Bernie Sanders supporters would invalidate the statement's accuracy. The external check's source corroborates this by highlighting that the selection was random, and the comedic context of the video is also significant.  Overall, there is a substantial lack of evidence to confirm the original caption's claim, and the internal and external checks align in their negative assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the caption is out of context. The image lacks sufficient evidence to confirm the claim about Bernie Sanders supporters, and external information reveals that the video's participants weren't exclusively Sanders supporters, nor was it solely focused on that group."

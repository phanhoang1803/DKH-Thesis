However, without photographic or other corroborating evidence, it remains difficult to definitively confirm. ",

    "explanation": "The image clearly shows a sheep inside a bus shelter. This aligns with the caption's core claim. Internal validation confirms the presence of a sheep in a bus shelter, but it cannot independently verify the location (Huisinish point on North Harris). External validation supports the plausibility of the scenario; sheep are known to wander, and bus shelters are found in rural areas. The location specified is a remote area in Scotland, increasing the likelihood of such an unusual event. However, external validation also notes the lack of concrete evidence beyond the image and the caption, and it does not attempt to confirm the location. The absence of any significant discrepancies between the image and the caption, combined with the plausible nature of the event as supported by external factors, leads to the conclusion that the caption is not out of context. The lower confidence score reflects the inability to definitively verify the location, despite the visual evidence strongly supporting the core claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the core claim (sheep in a bus shelter) with high confidence. External validation supports the plausibility of the scenario but notes the lack of location verification.  The combined evidence supports the caption's accuracy, although the location remains unverified."

How do I know this? Because if they tried praying to Satan just once, theyd be doing it every day. Multiple times per day. Its really that powerful. Its a real trip.\nSpeaking at a Stella McCartney fashion event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Katy Perry denied rumors that she has undergone plastic surgery, and instead attributed her refreshed look to a new spiritual outlook.\nAdvising everybody to add praying to Satan to your bucket list, Katy Perry compared her first time praying to Satan to a mythical movie, When Beckie Met Chad.\nThere is no evidence that the singer made these comments, although Perry did attend the star-studded Stella McCartney \"Stellabration\" fashion event and party in Los Angeles. She has often been the focus of moral panic-tinged occult rumors perhaps fueled by her professional progression from Christian-themed musician to sometimes-risque pop singer who campaigned for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (who is also often the focus of satanism and occult hoaxes).\nPerry's only on-the-record comment at the event that we could find was to the style and culture publication The Cut:\n[Stella McCartney] is the definition of good vibrations. Really, Stella, her work is so phenomenal, but she is such a good vibe. ... Its just always fun, thats why we come, because its not work. The clothes are so great, theyre just so architectural this season, and its just a big fat get together where we can be ourselves, conversate, and meet again. Im on the road so Im not able to go to a lot of these things, so its fun for me tonight.",

    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges that the image alone cannot verify or refute the claim in the caption. The image shows Katy Perry at an award show; it offers no information about her alleged statement regarding Satan.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence that the caption is false.  A reputable fact-checking website, Snopes, investigated and found no evidence to support the claim in the caption.  Snopes traces the origin of the false claim to a website known for generating fake news and presents Katy Perry's actual statement, which contradicts the claim in the caption.  Because the external check provides verifiable evidence from a trusted source refuting the caption's claim, and the internal check agrees that the image itself doesn't support it, we can conclude with high confidence that the caption is out of context. There is no visual evidence in the image to support the claim about Katy Perry's statement.  The image is of Perry at a public appearance, not a context that would obviously relate to a statement about Satan. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks lies in the scope of verification: the internal check limits itself to what can be derived from the image alone (which is nothing conclusive), while the external check uses outside information to decisively show the falsehood of the caption's claim. This is not a case of conflicting information; rather, it’s a case of limited scope versus complete and definitive verification. The external check provides evidence that supersedes the limitations of the internal check.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check: Image alone cannot verify or refute the caption's claim. External check: Reputable fact-checking website (Snopes) confirms that the claim is false, providing Katy Perry's actual statement that contradicts the caption. Both checks consistently support the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

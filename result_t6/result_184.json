    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The image itself provides strong internal validation for the caption. The presence of Nazi and Confederate flags displayed prominently at a table, seemingly for sale, directly supports the claim made in the caption.  The internal check gives a confidence score of 10 because the visual evidence is unambiguous.  The external check, with a confidence score of 8, confirms that news sources report social media posts documenting the presence of these flags at a rally.  The external source does not explicitly state the flags were 'for sale', but the visual evidence strongly suggests it. There is a minor discrepancy; the external source uses the word 'purported' to indicate a report about the event, introducing a degree of uncertainty. However, this is mitigated by the strong visual evidence in the image and the high confidence score from the internal check.  There is no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The flags are clearly visible and the setting appears consistent with the reported context of a rally. The overall assessment is that the caption is not out of context.  The confidence score is 9, reflecting the slightly lower confidence from the external source's use of the term 'purported' but bolstered by the clear visual evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's claim, with the internal check providing stronger evidence from the visual representation of the flags for sale.  A minor discrepancy exists regarding the explicit mention of the flags being \"for sale\", but this is mitigated by visual evidence."

On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "explanation": "The claim that the image depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is demonstrably false based on both internal and external verification.  Internal analysis of the image reveals a young girl with a distended abdomen, which could be indicative of various medical conditions, not necessarily pregnancy.  There is nothing in the image itself that supports the claim of pregnancy or the perpetrator's religious affiliation.  The lack of any contextual information within the image further weakens the original caption.  \n\nExternal verification strengthens this assessment significantly.  A reputable source (e.g., Snopes) has explicitly debunked the claim, identifying the image as miscaptioned. This source confirms that the girl is actually 12 years old and suffers from a medical condition causing abdominal distension, not pregnancy. They further detail how the image was deliberately misused to propagate harmful Islamophobic narratives.  The external evidence not only refutes the caption but also illuminates the deliberate manipulation behind the image's misrepresentation. The high confidence score reflects the alignment and corroboration between the internal visual analysis and the strong external evidence disproving the original caption's claim.\n\nThe discrepancy between the caption and the image's reality is substantial.  The internal analysis points to a possible medical condition rather than pregnancy, and the external source confirms this suspicion and exposes the malicious intent behind the misinformation.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in this case; the caption is definitively out of context and presents a fabricated story.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly refute the original caption.  The image shows a girl with a medical condition, not a pregnant child.  External sources explicitly debunk the claim, exposing the image's misuse in spreading Islamophobic misinformation."

    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence that the caption accurately describes the image. The image depicts a stag in what appears to be an autumnal landscape, possibly Richmond Park. The stag is bellowing, consistent with the rutting season.  However, the external validation check reveals a significant discrepancy. The external source provides no corroborating evidence for the caption's claim.  It does not mention Verna Evans as the photographer or confirm the image's origin as Richmond Park during rutting season. The lack of external verification significantly undermines the credibility of the caption. Therefore, despite the internal consistency, the absence of external evidence leads to a conclusion that the caption might be out of context. The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation fails to corroborate any details, resulting in a high level of uncertainty and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

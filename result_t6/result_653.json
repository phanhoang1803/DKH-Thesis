        "content": "DUBLIN (AP)  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday defended his decision to stay at one of President Donald Trumps properties while in Ireland in the face of criticism by Democrats and good government groups that hes enriching Trump at taxpayers expense. He called the Trump property a logical choice.\nSpeaking to reporters in Dublin, where he spent the day, Pence spoke about his personal connection to the village of Doonbeg  the site of both the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel as well as family history.\nIts deeply humbling for me to be able to come back to Ireland and have the opportunity to go to the very hometown of my mothers grandmother, said Pence.\nPence added that he understood political attacks by Democrats, but said the State Department had signed off on the decision. He said Doonbeg is a fairly small place and the opportunity to stay at the property, to accommodate the unique footprint that comes with our security detail and other personnel, made it logical.\nTrump, who owns hotels and golf clubs across the U.S. and in Europe, has come under intense criticism for frequenting properties he owns and profits from  giving them taxpayer-funded publicity and running up millions of dollars in taxpayer costs. Foreign governments and groups looking to curry favor with the president have also spent large sums at his properties, raising ethical alarms about potential pay-to-play dynamics and other conflicts.\nMarc Short, Pences chief of staff, told reporters aboard Air Force Two earlier that the decision to stay at the Trump property was made at the presidents suggestion and that Pence and his entourage were not staying for free. Short said Pences office followed official protocol and the club is the one facility in the Doonbeg area able to accommodate a group of their size.\nPence, who is traveling with his wife, mother and sister, had originally planned to visit the village at the end of a trip to Europe, spending a single night in the village after visits to Iceland, London and Dublin. But then Trump canceled his planned visit to Poland because of Hurricane Dorian, and asked Pence to take his place. That forced last-minute reshuffling of travel plans.\nInstead of making two separate trips to Europe or canceling Pences trip, his staff switched around the stops, so that he traveled from Poland to Ireland to Iceland to London. Under the new schedule, Pence is staying stay two nights in Doonbeg, but flew the hour-or-so into Dublin on Tuesday for official meetings, including coffee with Irish President Michael Higgins and lunch with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and his partner.\nShort said advance teams and Secret Service had already done weeks of planning work to secure the site, one reason they decided to keep the Doonbeg plan in place.\nThe decision drew criticism back home.\nDemocratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California accused Pence of Funneling taxpayer money to @POTUS by staying at this Trump resort, calling the move sooooooo corrupt.\nYour tax dollars: making the Trump family richer, the Democratic National Committee added by tweet, noting Trumps own visits to his Virginia golf club over the long weekend.\nThe Air Force puts the flight-cost of a C-32, the modified Boeing 757 jet known as Air Force Two when Pence is on board, at about $13,000 per hour. The vice president is personally covering all costs for his mother and sister, Short said.\nPence said he was pleased to have the opportunity to return to the village where he worked for several weeks during his first visit to Ireland when he was 22. He was greeted by a cheering crowd of several dozen outside Morrisseys, the restaurant and pub where he worked, which is still run by a distant relative.\nHis mother, Nancy, who is along for the ride, seemed to enjoy the scene. Asked what the vice president would order for dinner, she jokingly responded, a Guinness. Pence does not drink.\n__\nAssociated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report from Washington.\n__\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj",

The provided evidence focuses on Pence's visit to Ireland and the controversy surrounding his stay at a Trump property. There is no mention of Iceland, a new law, or Pence being expelled from any country. Therefore, the evidence does not support the news caption.",

    "explanation": "The provided image shows Mike Pence speaking at a podium.  The caption claims he was kicked out of Iceland due to a new law targeting religious fanatics. This claim is not supported by the image, which lacks any context related to Iceland or expulsion.  Internal validation confirms this discrepancy: the image shows only Pence speaking, with no visual cues suggesting a location or event aligning with the caption. The external validation further strengthens this assessment.  External sources focus on Pence's visit to Ireland and the related controversies, completely omitting any mention of Iceland, a new law, or Pence's removal from a country. Both internal and external checks converge on the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects this strong agreement between the image, internal analysis, and external information.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image only shows Mike Pence speaking, without any connection to Iceland or expulsion.  External sources corroborate this by focusing on his trip to Ireland,  providing no evidence of the events described in the caption."

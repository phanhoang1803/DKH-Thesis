        "content": "Claim:\nOn Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration's desire to be on good terms with the European Union.\nApproximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.\nOne conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform's captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said.\nTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation  whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason  we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden's speech.\nConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:\n\"Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.\"\nWhile saying \"I'm eager to hear,\" Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant \"mmmm\" in the word \"I'm\" blended with the next word, \"eager,\" to make a \"mnnm-eager\" sound. That was the source of the social media posts' allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker's reason for saying it.\nA more plausible reason for the president's phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.\nOn several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound), according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.\nIn other words, the claim is false  Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.",

      "explanation": "The claim that President Biden used the N-word during the Munich Security Conference is FALSE, according to a Snopes fact-check.  Snopes investigated social media claims alleging Biden used the slur during a speech.  They analyzed official White House transcripts and C-SPAN video footage.  The alleged instance stemmed from Biden's stuttering, which was misconstrued as him using the racial slur.  Snopes concluded that Biden did not use the N-word.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes fact-check debunks the claim, citing analysis of official White House transcripts and C-SPAN footage.  The alleged use of the slur was attributed to Biden's known speech impediment, not the use of the word itself.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The claim that President Biden used the N-word during the Munich Security Conference is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  The internal analysis acknowledges that the image shows President Biden speaking, potentially at the Munich Security Conference, but crucially, it notes the claim regarding the N-word cannot be visually verified. This aligns perfectly with the external fact-check from Snopes, which definitively refutes the claim. Snopes' investigation involved rigorous analysis of official White House transcripts and C-SPAN video footage, resources far more reliable than the image alone.  The Snopes report explains that the origin of the false claim stems from a misinterpretation of President Biden's speech impediment, his stuttering being mistaken for the use of the racial slur. This further solidifies the conclusion that the original caption is completely out of context. There is no visual evidence in the image to suggest the use of the N-word, and the external validation strongly contradicts the claim. The high confidence score reflects the strong alignment and reliability of both the internal and external checks, eliminating any uncertainty about the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations conclusively refute the claim that President Biden used the N-word at the Munich Security Conference. The image provides no visual evidence to support this claim, and the Snopes fact-check provides irrefutable evidence that the claim is false."

However, no taxpayer money was used for the first familys personal expenses.\nFULL QUESTION\nIs this true?\nMichelle Obama Takes Her Girls to London for Fish and Chips !!!\nOn Sunday, President Obama flew back to the United States on Air Force One. His wife, two daughters and her mother did a bit of shopping in Paris before taking their own Boeing 757 (C-32) over TO London to do some sight-seeing.\nNOTE: We all remember Obamas admonishment to corporate CEOs in February:\nYou cant get corporate jets, you cant go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayers dime.\nApparently that doesnt apply to his wife.\nThe London Times opened its description of Michelles visit this way:\nMotorcycle outriders, armoured Chevrolets and bullet-headed men in raincoats criss-crossed London yesterday as Michelle Obama and her daughters spent a second day on an unofficial visit to the capital.\nThe Times went on to describe that when Michelle and the girls arrived at Westminster Abbey, the building was closed to tourists with people already in told to wait against the wall. An American visiting the Abbey said Right then I knew it was probably someone from our royal family.\nMichelles motorcade shut down the London street above as the First Lady of the World and her children go for Fish and Chips at a pub in Mayfair . The entourage inside the restaurant was 15 people while dozens more wait outside. Include the dozens of Air Force personnel to fly and service the plane, embassy personnel and other staff and we are talking about a serious expenditure of tax payer dollars.\nMEANWHILE, millions of Americans have lost their jobs and wont be able to take their family on a summer vacation.\nBUT  Despite their circumstances theyll still be expected to fork over the tax dollars to pay for Michelles trip.\nTell your friends about this  its their TAX money, too!\nFULL ANSWER\nOn June 7, President Barack Obama wrapped up an overseas trip that included a major speech at Cairo University in Egypt, a visit to Saudi Arabia and Germany, and a 65th anniversary commemoration of D-Day in France. The president flew back to Washington, D.C., but his wife, Michelle, her mother and daughters went to London for two days of vacation. The chain e-mail above alleges that this vacation time was financed by taxpayer money, saying that while \"millions of Americans  wont be able to take their family on a summer vacation  theyll still be expected to fork over the tax dollars to pay for Michelles trip.\"\nNo Taxpayer Money for Personal Expenses\nIt is true that the Obamas visited Westminster Abbey, as well as a well-known local pub in Mayfair, as the e-mail says. The Obamas also visited Big Ben and Parliament. As an added treat for Sasha Obamas 8th birthday, the Obama girls met the actors from the \"Harry Potter\" movies. But the Obamas paid for their own personal expenses  not U.S. taxpayers. Katie McCormick Lelyveld, Michelle Obamas press secretary, told FactCheck.org in an e-mail: \"All personal travel and expenses incurred were paid for personally.\"\nCost of Security\nThe e-mail also questions the expenses for security for the family, saying that Michelle Obamas motorcade \"shut down [a] London street.\" President Obama has himself been criticized for similar reasons  in one instance, for flying with his wife to New York City for a date to dinner and a Broadway show. As was the case with Michelle Obamas vacation, the Obamas personally paidfor dinner and the tickets to the show. While policy dictates that tax money does not cover any personal expenses, the cost of security has historically been placed on the taxpayer.\nDuring any given trip, local law enforcement plays a big role in protecting presidents and their families. However, the United States Secret Service is the primary agency used to protect presidents, their families and some other members of an administration. According to the Congressional Research Service, the Secret Service is charged with protecting not only current presidents, vice presidents and their families, but also former presidents, children of former presidents under the age of 16, visiting heads of foreign states and other distinguished foreign visitors, and major presidential and vice presidential candidates. The same even goes for former vice presidents: Former Vice President Dick Cheney recently requested an additional six months of secret service protection  a request which was granted by President Obama.\n Andrew Karter\nSources",

    "explanation": "The internal validation acknowledges a potential connection between the image and the caption, noting that the scene depicts a person at a table in Westminster Abbey, potentially related to administration or registration, which might be associated with a vaccination site. However, there's no explicit visual evidence of vaccination activities. The external validation, while referencing Westminster Abbey, focuses on a separate event (Michelle Obama's visit), which has limited relevance to the claim about a Covid-19 vaccination site.  The disagreement between the internal and external validations highlights a crucial point:  while the location matches, the activities depicted in the image don't directly confirm the caption's claim of a Covid-19 vaccination site.  The image depicts a person working on laptops, not administering vaccinations.  The external evidence, while not directly contradicting, is completely irrelevant to the caption's specific assertion regarding a vaccination site. The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty. The caption is likely out of context because the image does not show a Covid-19 vaccination site.  It may be a registration point for something else taking place at the Abbey, but the caption's claim is too specific and not supported by visual evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds a weak potential link, but not a strong confirmation. External validation is irrelevant to the specific claim.  The image lacks visual evidence to support the caption's main claim of a COVID-19 vaccination site."

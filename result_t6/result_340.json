(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly indicate that the original caption, \"The icebergs pictured above as a phenomenon encountered in Lake Michigan,\" is inaccurate. The internal check points out the fundamental geographical impossibility of such large icebergs existing in Lake Michigan, a freshwater lake. The external check corroborates this by referencing information that while the original image's origin was correctly identified, later versions misrepresented the location, falsely claiming them to be from Lake Michigan.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. The image depicts a large iceberg, characteristic of colder, glacial regions, not Lake Michigan. The visual evidence of the iceberg itself supports the conclusion that the image is not from Lake Michigan.  The high confidence score reflects the strong consistency between the visual evidence, internal logical analysis, and the externally sourced information.  There's no ambiguity or uncertainty in this case. The image is clearly of an iceberg from a glacial environment, a geographical context fundamentally different from Lake Michigan.  The external validation adds additional weight to this conclusion by detailing the history of misattribution, further solidifying the claim that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations decisively confirm that the caption is out of context. The image depicts an iceberg inconsistent with Lake Michigan's environment, and external sources confirm the misattribution of the image's location."

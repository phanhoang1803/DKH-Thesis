    "explanation": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's claim. The image clearly depicts a sunset over Lossiemouth, a coastal town in Moray, Scotland.  The visual elements align perfectly with the caption's description. The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10 due to this strong visual match. However, the external check yields a low confidence score of 3, as it fails to find corroborating evidence from external sources.  The external check searched for information confirming a photo of a sunset at Lossiemouth taken by Sam Murray, but no such information was readily available. This discrepancy between internal and external validation creates uncertainty. While the image itself strongly supports the caption, the lack of external verification lowers the overall confidence. The absence of external evidence does not necessarily disprove the caption; it merely highlights a lack of confirmation. Thus, while the image internally suggests the caption is accurate, the absence of corroborating external evidence necessitates a conservative assessment.  Because of the substantial gap in confidence scores between internal and external verification, and due to the lack of external confirmation, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to definitively confirm the captionâ€™s accuracy.  Therefore, even though the visual evidence strongly suggests the caption is accurate,  the lack of external support necessitates classifying the caption as potentially out of context (OOC). The overall confidence score is lowered to reflect this uncertainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, showing a clear visual match between the image and the description. However, external validation fails to find corroborating evidence, leading to a discrepancy and reduced confidence. The lack of external confirmation, despite the strong internal evidence, results in a conservative assessment of the caption's accuracy."

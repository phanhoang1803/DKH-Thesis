        "content": "Claim:\nCalifornia's governor is under investigation for possible corruption.\nOn 17 April 2017, the web site consjournal.com published a story purporting to link California Governor Jerry Brown to a corruption investigation.\nHowever, the story didn't stand up to the barest of scrutiny. The headline said that Brown was \"caught in the middle of a $60 billion corruption investigation,\" a premise that is undermined by the sources it cites, each of which states that Brown ordered the probe into the state Board of Equalization  but he was not the subject of the investigation.\nOne of those sources, a March 2017 Sacramento Bee story, identifies the focus of the identification, which was spurred in part by an audit of the department:\nThe reports authors say they found well-paid tax auditors on parking lot duty at a promotional event, a steep rise in spending on activities that do not appear connected to taxes, and misleading information provided to lawmakers.\nThe audit takes particular aim at board member Jerome Horton, finding that he has reassigned public employees to work for him, arranged events that strayed from the agencys mission and opened a call center in his district without securing the consent of his fellow elected leaders. Horton has defended his outreach events as a way to reach large numbers of taxpayers.\nThe following month, Brown asked the state Justice Department to investigate the department, which collects an estimated $60 billion a year from more than 30 types of taxes, including fuel for motor vehicles and jets; alcoholic beverage taxes; and taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products, among others. It functions independently of the state Franchise Tax Board, which collects personal income taxes, and the Employment Development Department, which focuses on payroll taxes.\nA separate audit conducted in November 2015 found that board staffers incorrectly sent nearly $47.8 million in taxes to the state general fund. California State Controller Betty Yee undertook the review after noticing \"irregularities\" in the fund.\nBesides ordering an investigation into the board, Brown said in a letter to its members that he had barred it from hiring \"key personnel\", and restricted its ability to issue contracts without outside approval.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that California Governor Jerry Brown is \"Caught in the Middle\" of a corruption investigation.  Source 1 from Snopes.com directly addresses this claim. While an investigation into the California State Board of Equalization was launched, the article explicitly states that Governor Brown was not the subject of the investigation; he initiated the investigation himself. The headline's claim is misleading, as it implies Brown is a target of the investigation rather than the initiator. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check identified a discrepancy: while the image shows Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, it lacks visual evidence related to a corruption investigation. The image only depicts Brown speaking at an event; no details directly link him to any corrupt activities. The external validation check provided strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim. A source from Snopes.com clarified that Brown was not a target of the investigation mentioned in the caption; instead, he initiated the investigation himself. This external evidence significantly weakens the caption's accuracy. The internal check's lower confidence score (8) reflects the image's lack of direct visual evidence for the corruption investigation. The external check's confidence score (8) stems from the clear evidence from Snopes.com. Combining these assessments, a higher confidence score of 9 is assigned to the final verdict that the caption is out of context, with the external evidence being more definitive in discrediting the caption's implied assertion. The caption is misleading because it suggests Brown is involved in corruption when the evidence indicates he initiated the investigation into others.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal discrepancies.  Internal check highlights lack of visual evidence of corruption within the image. External check from a reputable source (Snopes.com) strongly contradicts the caption's claim, showing that Brown initiated the investigation rather than being implicated in it. This leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

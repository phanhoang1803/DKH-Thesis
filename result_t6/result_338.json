The photo was actually taken at the National Institutes of Health campus in Maryland  and Melinda Gates is not in the picture.\nFull Story\nA years-old photo of former President Barack Obama and Dr. Anthony Fauci is spreading on Facebook with a false claim to suggest a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015!!!! reads text at the top of the viral image.\nBelow it, a screenshot of a tweet shows a photo of Obama speaking with a scientist as Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stands in the background alongside a woman misidentified as Melinda Gates.\nThe tweets text claims that the picture shows Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the WuHan lab where they paid the lab 3.7 million for a bat project? We know that well now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!\nBut the photo is not from the Wuhan lab; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.\nA reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014  in the U.S.\nThe picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\nObama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell  not Melinda Gates.\nThe tweets claim that they paid the lab 3.7 million for a bat project, meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that weve addressed multiple times before.\nThat figure refers to an NIH grant  which actually totaled $3.4 million  awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.\nThe organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealths spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.\nEcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology  a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH  but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

The photo shows then-President Barack Obama visiting the National Institutes of Health in 2014 along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nations top infectious disease expert, and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. They are listening to Dr. Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nTHE FACTS: A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims the former president visited an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, China, in 2015, an effort to link Obama to a debunked conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was made in a lab.\nThe post includes a screenshot of a tweet with the photo that says, you mean this Dr. Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the Wuhan lab where they paid $3.7 million for a bat project.\nThe photo not only does not show Obama in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, but it also inaccurately portrays Obamas role with the grant. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health awarded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based environmental health nonprofit, a grant of $3.25 million for five years to study bats in southern China for unknown coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology received about $600,000 of the grant. The grant was renewed under President Donald Trumps administration in 2019, but was terminated in April before new funding could be given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe photo of the president at the NIH campus in December of 2014 can be found on the NIH directors blog with the accurate caption. Obama visited the NIH Vaccine Research Center to see work being done against Ebola. During his visit, he also gave a speech where, the blog says, he emphasized the need for emergency congressional authorization of resources for Ebola research.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

Also, the woman in the red shirt is not Melinda Gates.\nThis photograph was taken in December 2014 at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and shows Obama and Fauci with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and Chief of the Biodefense Research Section Nancy Sullivan.\nThe photograph is available via the NIH Director's blog, where it is accompanied by the following caption: \"Dr. Nancy Sullivan of NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) discussing Ebola research with President Barack Obama as NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell look on.\"\nDr. Francis Collins went on to write in the blog:\nToday, we had the great honor of welcoming President Barack Obama to the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MDto see first-hand the progress that biomedical research is making against Ebola virus disease. The President toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center, and met with scientists who are working hard to develop ways to combat this deadly virus that continues to devastate West Africa. And, in a speech before a packed auditorium at the NIH Clinical Center, the President praised the contributions of NIH staff. He also emphasized the need for emergency Congressional authorization of resources to ensure that our nations research and public health efforts against Ebola will lead as quickly as possible to an end to this devastating outbreak.\nA number of similar images from this visit are available via Getty Images.\nThe text accompanying this viral image also full of misinformation.

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that the photograph depicts President Obama, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Melinda Gates at a laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2015.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly contradict this claim. \n\nInternal validation reveals inconsistencies within the image itself. While President Obama and what appears to be Dr. Fauci are present, Melinda Gates is not visible.  The location also cannot be definitively verified as Wuhan, China, from the image alone. This uncertainty is reflected in the low internal confidence score of 6. \n\nExternal validation provides compelling evidence refuting the caption. Multiple sources corroborate that the photograph was actually taken at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, in December 2014.  These sources explicitly state that Melinda Gates was not present and that the location was incorrectly identified. The high external confidence score of 10 underscores the strength of this contradictory evidence. \n\nThe discrepancy between the caption and the verified information is significant. The internal validation highlights uncertainties primarily due to the limitations of image analysis in pinpointing the exact location and identifying all individuals.  However, the external validation provides irrefutable evidence from multiple credible sources that directly contradicts the original caption's claims. These external sources are definitive in placing the photograph's setting in Bethesda, Maryland, and specifying the year as 2014, directly contradicting the Wuhan, China, and 2015 claim.  They further confirm that Melinda Gates is absent from the photograph. \n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence from multiple external sources and the internal validation's inability to definitively confirm the original caption's claims, it's concluded that the caption is out of context and misleading. The significant difference between the internal and external confidence scores (6 and 10, respectively) underscores this conclusion. The external evidence has a far greater weight due to its explicit and direct contradiction of the caption, coming from multiple independent credible sources. The external information is more reliable and definitive than any inferences drawn solely from visual analysis of the image.\n\nTherefore, the final verdict is that the caption is definitively out of context, with a high confidence score of 10, reflecting the strong agreement between the internal and external validation processes and the weight of evidence from reliable external sources.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute the original caption. Internal validation points to inconsistencies in identifying all individuals and the precise location, while external validation provides definitive evidence contradicting the caption's claims regarding location, date, and the presence of Melinda Gates.  The external validation significantly outweighs the internal due to the strength and number of independent sources verifying the factual details."

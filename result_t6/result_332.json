        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (AP)  A 15-year-old student killed a teacher and another teenager with a handgun Monday at a Christian school in Wisconsin, terrifying classmates including a second grader who made the 911 call that sent dozens of police officers rushing to the small school just a week before its Christmas break.\nThe female student, who was identified at a press conference Monday night, also wounded six others at a study hall at Abundant Life Christian School, including two students who were in critical condition, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said. A teacher and three students had been taken to a hospital with less serious injuries, and two of them had been released by Monday evening.\nEvery child, every person in that building is a victim and will be a victim forever. ... We need to figure out and try to piece together what exactly happened, Barnes said.\nBarbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations for Abundant Life Christian School, said students handled themselves magnificently.\nShe said when the school practices safety routines, which it had done just before the school year, leaders always announce that it is a drill. That didnt happen Monday.\nWhen they heard, Lockdown, lockdown, they knew it was real, she said.\nPolice said the shooter, identified as Natalie Rupnow, was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound when officers arrived and died en route to a hospital. Barnes declined to offer additional details about the shooter, partly out of respect for the family.\nAbundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school  prekindergarten through high school  with approximately 420 students in Madison, the state capital.\nWiers said the school does not have metal detectors but uses other security measures including cameras.\nChildren and families were reunited at a health clinic about a mile away. Parents pressed children against their chests while others squeezed hands and shoulders as they walked side by side. One girl was comforted with an adult-size coat around her shoulders as she moved to a parking lot teeming with police vehicles.\nA motive for the shooting was not immediately known, nor was it clear if the victims were targeted, Barnes said.\nI dont know why, and I feel like if we did know why, we could stop these things from happening, he told reporters.\nBarnes said police were talking with the shooters father and other family members, who were cooperating, and searching the shooters home.\nHe lost someone as well, Barnes said of the shooters father. And so were not going to rush the information. Well take our time and make sure we do our due diligence.\nThe first 911 call to report an active shooter came in shortly before 11 a.m. First responders who were in training just 3 miles (5 kilometers) away dashed to the school for an actual emergency, Barnes said. They arrived 3 minutes after the initial call and went into the building immediately.\nClasses had been taking place when the shooting happened, Barnes said.\nInvestigators believe the shooter used a 9mm pistol, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.\nPolice blocked off roads around the school, and federal agents were at the scene to assist local law enforcement. No shots were fired by police.\nAbundant Life asked for prayers in a brief Facebook post.\nWiers said the schools goal is to have staff get together early in the week and have community opportunities for students to reconnect before the winter break, but its still to be decided whether they will resume classes this week.\nBethany Highman, the mother of a student, rushed to the school and learned over FaceTime that her daughter was OK.\nAs soon as it happened, your world stops for a minute. Nothing else matters, Highman said. Theres nobody around you. You just bolt for the door and try to do everything you can as a parent to be with your kids.\nIn a statement, President Joe Biden cited the tragedy in calling on Congress to pass universal background checks, a national red flag law and certain gun restrictions.\nWe can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their families, and tears entire communities apart, Biden said. He spoke with Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway and offered his support.\nEvers said its unthinkable that a child or teacher would go to school and never return home.\nThe school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas.\nThe shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to doing active shooter drills in their classrooms. But school shootings have done little to move the needle on national gun laws.\nFirearms were the leading cause of death among children in 2020 and 2021, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues.\nRhodes-Conway said the country needs to do more to prevent gun violence.\nI hoped that this day would never come to Madison, she said.\n___\nThis story has been updated to reflect police saying the shooter was 15. A law enforcement official previously said the shooter was 17. This story has also been updated to correct that Abundant Life Christian School serves grades prekindergarten through high school, not kindergarten through high school.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer, Ed White and Josh Funk and photographer Morry Gash contributed to this report.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds a strong match between the image and the caption. The image depicts two women who appear distressed, possibly crying, outside what could be interpreted as a reunification center. This aligns well with the caption's description of residents crying outside such a center after a deadly shooting. The external validation check corroborates this. While the source doesn't explicitly mention crying, it describes a scene at a reunification center (a health clinic in this case) where families are being reunited in an emotionally charged atmosphere, implying distress and likely tears. The emotional state of the people is evident in the image and also implied in the external source. The high confidence score reflects the strong consistency between the image, the caption, and the external source, supporting the accuracy of the caption. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks, and no visual evidence suggests tampering or miscontextualization.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations support the caption's accuracy. The image shows emotional distress aligning with the caption, and external evidence describes a similar scene at a reunification center after the shooting."

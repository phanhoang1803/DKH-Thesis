        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph of a scantily clad singer represents \"antifa\" in a Seattle anti-police-brutality protest zone in summer 2020.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn late June 2020, social media users shared a photograph of a performer in a revealing black netting outfit alongside claims that the individual was among anti-fascist activists  also known as \"antifa\"  who had taken up residence in a police-free zone in Seattle that had become known as the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP).\nThe CHOP, which gained its moniker because its in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle, was initially dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). It was set up by demonstrators amid protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose in-custody death while pinned under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020 went viral after being captured on video.\nDuring the resulting weeks of sustained protests against racism and police brutality, Seattle activists set up the police-free zone, which has become a target for criticism by President Donald Trump and his supporters. But disparaging comments linking the performer to the CHOP are misleading, as the image has nothing to do with the protests.\nHere is the version of the photograph that is being shared, along with commentary such as, \"Antifa Seattle today  this is the group that the Democrats want to rule America  no further comment necessary?!\"\nBut the picture wasn't taken in Seattle, and it wasn't taken during the protests that swept the nation in the spring of 2020 in the wake of Floyd's killing.\nThe original photograph was taken by photographer Peretz Partensky on Sept. 25, 2011, at the Folsom Street Fair, which is a leather and BDSM festival that takes place every fall in San Francisco, California. And the singer in the black netting is a member of the Italian disco band Hard Ton, which is based in Venice, Italy, according to its Facebook profile. The antifa flag in the upper left corner was edited into the picture after the fact.\nWe contacted Hard Ton for comment about the picture being misappropriated, but did not hear back in time for publication.\nBecause the original photograph was taken long before the CHOP was set up in Seattle, and the events took place in a different location altogether, we rate this claim \"Miscaptioned.\"",

The image was altered to include an antifa flag. Therefore, the claim that the photograph depicts antifa in a Seattle protest zone is false.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original news caption is out of context. The internal check identifies discrepancies between the caption and the image content. The image depicts a protest sign with demands related to police funding and protester release, not a scantily clad singer representing \"antifa.\"  The external check provides strong evidence from Snopes, confirming the miscaptioning and providing details about the image's origin (a 2011 San Francisco festival) and subsequent alteration.  The high confidence scores from both checks (7 and 10 respectively) reinforce the conclusion. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; they both independently confirm the caption's inaccuracy.  The visual evidence itself supports this conclusion:  The image clearly shows a protest sign with specific text and demands, entirely unrelated to the description of a scantily-clad singer and the term \"antifa.\"\n\nThe external evidence from Snopes is crucial as it provides a detailed history of the image, definitively establishing its origin and the context in which it was originally used, completely different from the one described in the caption.  It's important to note that the external evidence not only confirms the internal analysis but also adds additional critical context, such as the image alteration with the addition of an antifa flag. This further reinforces the conclusion that the caption is not only inaccurate in its description of the image but also deliberately misrepresents the image's content and original context.\n\nThe visual analysis is straightforward. There is no scantily-clad singer.  The main visual element is a large protest sign clearly visible and legible. There are other protest-related signs in the background.  These visual details are completely incompatible with the caption's description of the image.  Therefore, there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the visual interpretation which directly supports the findings from both the internal and external validation checks.\n\nIn summary, the strong agreement between internal and external validation, the high confidence scores, and the straightforward visual analysis conclusively demonstrate that the caption is entirely out of context and misleading. There is no evidence to support the caption's claim. ",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows a protest sign, not a scantily clad singer; the image's origin and alterations were confirmed by Snopes, demonstrating the caption's falsity."

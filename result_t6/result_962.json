It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is False.

Snopes demonstrates that the image circulating online is a digitally fabricated image.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption to be accurate based solely on the visual content of the image. The image shows Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wearing shirts with what appears to be Donald Trump's image and campaign slogans.  However, the external check, using Snopes.com, reveals that the image is digitally fabricated. Snopes provides strong evidence demonstrating that the image is not authentic and that the actors were not actually wearing those shirts. This creates a direct conflict between the internal visual analysis and the external fact-checking result. The discrepancy is significant because it shows that the visual evidence is misleading and has been manipulated.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check, coupled with the irrefutable evidence from Snopes showing digital manipulation, significantly outweighs the internal check's analysis which was solely based on a deceptive visual representation.   Therefore, the original caption, stating that Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell were photographed wearing Donald Trump campaign shirts, is determined to be false and out of context because the image is a manipulated fabrication.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check based on visual analysis deemed the caption accurate, while external fact-checking (Snopes) revealed the image to be digitally manipulated, proving the caption false and out of context. External evidence is prioritized due to the clear indication of image manipulation."

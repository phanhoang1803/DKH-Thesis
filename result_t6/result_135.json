One popular versions, which garnered tens of thousands of shares, was posted to the \"Amazing World\" Facebook page in April 2017 with the query \"Insane Cliff House ? Would you live in it?\":\nThis is not a genuine photograph of a habitable (or even existent) home on the underside of a cliff. Rather, it's a piece of digital art created as part of an advertising campaign for a concrete adhesive.\nThis \"Insane Cliff House\" image was one of several produced by the creative advertising agency JWT in 2013 to promote a line of Fester brand construction products. The \"Somos ms de lo que imaginas\" (\"We are more than you imagine\") campaign pictured Henkel's line of Fester construction products performing amazing and improbable feats, such as securing a house (with a pool) to the underside of a cliff.\nThe brand shared a version of the print advertisement on their Facebook page:",

    "explanation": "The internal check, based solely on the image, suggests the caption is accurate. The image depicts a house seemingly built into a cliff, appearing inhabitable. However, the external check, citing a Snopes fact check, reveals the image to be digitally created art, not a real structure. This directly contradicts the caption's claim of a \"real, inhabitable house.\" The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from the Snopes fact check, a reputable source for verifying information. The discrepancy between the internal visual assessment and the external factual verification highlights the importance of corroborating visual evidence with reliable external sources. In this case, while the image itself appears to support the caption, the external evidence definitively proves the caption is misleading. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context.",

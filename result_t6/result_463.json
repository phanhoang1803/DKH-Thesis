Furthermore, no official announcements were made on 1 April 2018 about Daniel Radcliffe's return to the series, nor is any upcoming movie called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child or any derivation thereof in the works.\nHowever, this particular hoax was easier to believe, because it does have some basis in fact. A play by the same name, which is based on a short story written by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne (who also wrote the play) has run in London since 2016, and opens on Broadway in April 2018.\nSome Facebook pages have this poster presented as if it is genuine; others have admitted that this movie news was nothing more than a hoax:\nThe fan-made poster has been around since at least December 2017. It appears to have been created by someone who goes by \"BlueWolfArtista,\" and it was originally shared with tags such as \"concept art\" and \"photomanipulation.\" The image of the cursed child was created by altering a still shot of actor Asa Butterfield from the movie Ender's Game:\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a legitimate play, but whether it will become a movie remains to be seen  and it's a good bet that if it does, the announcement won't be made on 1 April.",

    "explanation": "The provided caption claims that Daniel Radcliffe announced in April 2018 that he would reprise his role as Harry Potter in a movie called \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\"  Internal validation reveals some alignment with the image, as it depicts Daniel Radcliffe in a Harry Potter-related context. However, the internal check also flags inaccuracies: the image is from a stage play, not a movie, and the date is incorrect. The external check decisively refutes the claim. It provides evidence that the April 2018 announcement was a hoax stemming from a fan-made poster, and that no official announcement was made by Radcliffe or any official source.  The discrepancy between internal and external checks is substantial. The internal check, while recognizing some visual alignment, is limited in its ability to independently verify the claim's factuality.  The external check's evidence, from a reputable source (presumably an article documenting the hoax), carries far more weight.  The combination of the internal check's identification of inaccuracies in the caption and the external check's direct refutation of the central claim definitively indicates that the caption is out of context.  The visual evidence itself, while showing Daniel Radcliffe, is not sufficient to validate the specific claims made in the caption about the announcement date, the nature of the project (movie vs. play), and the truthfulness of the announcement itself.  The strength of the external evidence, coupled with the internal check's confirmation of inaccuracies, leads to high confidence in the conclusion that the caption is false and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially aligns with the image but identifies inaccuracies in the caption. External validation decisively refutes the caption's claim, showing it to be a hoax. The external evidence significantly outweighs the limited internal validation, leading to a clear conclusion that the caption is out of context."

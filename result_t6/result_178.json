        "content": "Nearly a month after supporters of President Donald Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recounted the experience from her perspective.\nIn a 90-minute Instagram Live video, Oscasio-Cortez described fearing for her life as she hid in the bathroom of her office in the Cannon House Office Building, a part of the Capitol complex.\nDays later, the second-term congresswoman pushed back against right-wing critics who said she exaggerated the danger she faced during the riot.\n\"AOC wasnt even in the Capitol building during her near death experience,\" read one headline on RedState, one of several conservative websites that questioned Ocasio-Cortezs account.\n\"AOC lied!\" another headline said. \"She Wasnt Even in the Capitol Building During the RiotHer Life Was Never in Danger: Report.\"\nSimilar claims attacking Ocasio-Cortez cropped up in widespread posts on Facebook, where they were flagged as part of the companys efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nOn Twitter, hashtags likened Ocasio-Cortez to actor Jussie Smollett, who was indicted for false reports to police and accused of staging an attack against himself.\nThe criticism also reached cable news. \"There were no rioters in (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's) hallway,\" said Fox News host Tucker Carlson. \"Trump voters weren't trying to kill her.\"\nOcasio-Cortez stood by her remarks and pushed back against the attacks online. As she went back and forth on Twitter with conservative activist and One America News Network correspondent Jack Posobiec, readers asked PolitiFact what was true and what wasnt.\nIts true that Ocasio-Cortez was not in the main Capitol building where the House and Senate chambers are located as rioters broke in. She was in the Cannon building.\nBut she never claimed in her video to have been in the main Capitol building, and the Cannon building was one of two buildings in the broader Capitol complex that was forced to evacuate.\nOcasio-Cortez feared she \"could die\" as police knocked on her door\nIn her Instagram Live video, Ocasio-Cortez said she had just gotten off the phone with her chief of staff and was scrolling through lunch options at around 1 p.m. when she heard \"huge, violent bangs on my door.\" It was like \"someone was trying to break the door down,\" she said.\nAround that time, rioters were already gathering outside the Capitol, but they had not broken in, according to timelines from USA Today, the Washington Post and the New York Times.\nOcasio-Cortez said she ran over to her legislative director, Geraldo \"G\" Bonilla-Chavez, who told her to \"hide, hide, run and hide.\"\nAs she hid in her office bathroom behind the door, Ocasio-Cortez said she heard a mans voice yelling from inside her office. \"I just hear, Where is she? Where is she?\" Ocasio-Cortez told her Instagram Live viewers. \"And this is the moment where I thought everything was over.\"\n\"I mean, I thought I was going to die,\" she said.\nOcasio-Cortez said the person calling for her was actually a Capitol Police officer who did not identify himself  a fact she did not know as she hid.\nOcasio-Cortez said the Capitol Police officer told her to go to another building. She said she could hear \"all of these rioters behind the glass of the door\" as she and Bonilla-Chavez sought a place to take shelter. She ended up hunkering down in the office of Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., who also detailed the experience on Feb. 1 during an interview with MSNBC.\n\"I fully expected that by this point, the building had been breached and there were people walking the hallways,\" she said.\nThe attacks\nSome websites attacking Ocasio-Cortez cited comments from Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. Mace tweeted Feb. 2 that the rioters never made it to the hallway she shares with Ocasio-Cortez.\nMace was addressing a story from Newsweek, which erroneously reported that Ocasio-Cortez said rioters had entered her office. In her Instagram Live video, Ocasio-Cortez said that she was scared by the banging on her door because she did not know it was an officer.\n\"None of us knew in the moment what areas were compromised,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Feb. 4, after Mace shared a Fox News headline that used her comments to discredit Ocasio-Cortez.\nThe Cannon building was one of two buildings evacuated by Capitol Police as pro-Trump rioters outside moved toward to Capitol, which they broke into just after 2 p.m. It is a part of the larger Capitol complex, which is connected by underground tunnels accessible to lawmakers.\nSeveral lawmakers, including Mace, tweeted about the evacuation in real time. \"Just evacuated my office due to a nearby threat,\" Mace wrote in her Jan. 6 tweet posted at 1:45 p.m. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., said that the evacuation was due to \"a pipe bomb reported outside.\"\nThe Capitol Police did not respond to PolitiFacts inquiry about the evacuation. An FBI agents affidavit in support of an arrest warrant for one man charged in the riot said that the evacuation was \"in part because of a suspicious package found nearby.\"\nPipe bombs were discovered Jan. 6 near the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters. Both locations are within blocks of the Cannon building.\n\"They are manipulating the fact that most people dont know the layout (of) the Capitol complex,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet. \"We were all on the Capitol complex  the attack wasnt just on the dome. The bombs Trump supporters planted surrounded our offices too.\"\nA spokesperson for the congresswoman declined to comment further.\nThe criticism of Ocasio-Cortez also minimized the threat posed to lawmakers and police by the mob at the Capitol, as Snopes reported. Videos and photos show rioters fighting with police, carrying zip-tie handcuffs and weapons, and chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n\"Assassinate AOC,\" one man facing charges tweeted hours after storming the building.",

      "explanation": "Source 1 mentions that photographs of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were shared widely on TikTok and Twitter in late 2020 and early 2021, during the time of the Capitol riot.  While the source doesn't explicitly state the content of those photographs, the context strongly implies the existence of such photos circulating on social media. The article focuses on the events surrounding the riot and Ocasio-Cortez's experience, implicitly confirming the presence of her images circulating online in that period.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1:  The article discusses online reactions to Ocasio-Cortez's account of the Capitol riot and mentions the spread of claims and discussions on Facebook and Twitter, directly implying the existence of widely shared photographs during that period.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies that the image depicts Dua Lipa, not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, resulting in a verdict of False with a confidence score of 0.  The external check, however, finds evidence suggesting that photos of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were widely circulated on social media platforms like TikTok and Twitter during late 2020 and early 2021. This external evidence has a higher confidence score of 8, based on an article discussing the online reaction to Ocasio-Cortez's experiences during the Capitol riot. The discrepancy arises because the image itself is unrelated to the caption's claim. The caption is factually correct in stating photos of AOC circulated online, but this fact is not relevant to or supported by the provided image of Dua Lipa.  Therefore, because the image is entirely unrelated to the statement in the caption, the overall verdict is that the caption is out of context (OOC). The final confidence score reflects the strength of the external evidence supporting the existence of online photos of AOC, while acknowledging the complete mismatch between the image and the caption's subject.  In essence, the caption is factually correct but irrelevant to the accompanying image, and therefore misrepresenting the content.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption inaccurate (confidence 0) because the image shows Dua Lipa. External check confirmed that photos of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were indeed widely shared online during late 2020 and early 2021 (confidence 8), but this external validation is irrelevant to the image.  The significant discrepancy makes the caption out of context."

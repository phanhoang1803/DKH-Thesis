Such claims have been passed around the Internet since October 2001, playing on fears of receiving hazardous substances in the mail.\nThese type of spurious emails tend to resurface periodically; in June 2017 residents in Melbourne, Australia reported receiving their own batch of messages about \"fatal perfumes.\"",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the perfume \"Lovely\" causes death upon smelling it. This claim is demonstrably false based on both internal and external verification.  The internal check analyzes the image, which only shows a bottle of perfume; there is no visual evidence to support the deadly effect claimed in the caption. The internal analysis concludes that the image and caption are completely unrelated, assigning a confidence score of 0.  The external check leverages the fact-checking website Snopes, which has debunked this claim as a hoax.  Snopes provides a thorough investigation, showing multiple iterations of this false claim and confirming its falsehood. It gives a confidence score of 10.  Because the external source provides a strong refutation with high confidence and the internal analysis agrees that the image offers no support for the caption, we conclude that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score from the external check and the agreement from the internal check provide a high level of certainty that the original caption is false and not supported by any evidence, visual or otherwise. The lack of any connection between the image and caption leads to a definite conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image shows a perfume bottle, while the caption makes a false and unsubstantiated claim about its deadly effects.  External fact-checking corroborates this conclusion."

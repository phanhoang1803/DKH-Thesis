      "explanation": "Santiago Abascal is indeed the founder of Vox, a Spanish far-right political party.  He did leave the Popular Party (PP), but the claim that he broke with them in 2013 needs verification. While Abascal's political career and his departure from the PP are verifiable, the exact year requires further fact-checking from reliable sources. The description of him as a \"fiery speaker\" is subjective but generally accepted.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both largely agree that the caption accurately reflects the image and the broader context of Santiago Abascal's role in founding Vox. The internal check highlights the presence of Abascal in the image and the visibility of the Vox logo, providing strong visual support for the caption's central claim. The external check corroborates Abascal's founding of Vox and his previous membership in the Popular Party.  However, a discrepancy arises regarding the year Abascal left the Popular Party. The caption states 2013, while the external check indicates a need for further verification on this specific detail.  The external check's confidence score (6) is slightly lower than the internal check's score (8) primarily due to this uncertainty about the exact year.  The 'fiery speaker' descriptor is subjective and relies on general knowledge rather than direct visual evidence, which slightly reduces the overall confidence score.  Given the strong visual evidence and general factual accuracy, there's a sufficiently high confidence level to deem the caption not out of context, albeit with a minor qualification about the precise year of Abascal's departure from the Popular Party.  In summary, the caption's core message is supported, but minor details require further verification, leading to a confidence score of 7.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal and external checks largely agree on the caption's accuracy.  A minor discrepancy exists regarding the year Abascal left the Popular Party.  Visual evidence strongly supports the central claim. Overall confidence is high but reduced slightly due to the need for fact-checking on a minor detail."

  "final_result": {

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check strongly supports the caption's accuracy, with a confidence score of 10.  The image clearly shows Serhiy Kivalov at what appears to be the Liberty Ball, an event associated with President Trump's inauguration.  All elements mentioned in the caption (Kivalov, Liberty Ball, Trump's inauguration) are visually present. The external validation, while not definitive, adds further credence. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of a Ukrainian lawmaker attending a US presidential inauguration, citing the common practice of foreign officials attending such events.  While the external check doesn't confirm Kivalov's presence specifically, it doesn't contradict the image's visual evidence either. The fact that the image was posted to Facebook on January 21, 2017, further strengthens the temporal context, aligning it with the date of Trump's inauguration.  The overall assessment is that both internal and external checks, while not providing absolute certainty, strongly support the caption's claim.  There's no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization. The image's details align with the caption's statements. The minor discrepancy lies in the external check's lower confidence score (8) compared to the internal check's higher score (10). This difference is primarily due to the lack of readily accessible, definitive external sources explicitly confirming Kivalov's attendance. However, the absence of contradictory evidence, combined with the strong internal validation, justifies a high overall confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption's claim, although the external check has a slightly lower confidence score due to the lack of readily available definitive proof of Kivalov's specific attendance. However, visual evidence combined with the plausible scenario strongly support the caption's accuracy."

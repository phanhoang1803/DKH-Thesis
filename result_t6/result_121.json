        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that a video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check reveals several inconsistencies. While the video does depict people damaging structures, it cannot definitively identify them as 5G towers. The caption's geographical location (China) appears consistent with the video's general context. However, the crucial link to COVID-19 is absent from the visual evidence.  The confidence score of 7 reflects this uncertainty.  The internal analysis alone cannot confirm or deny the claim.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation process provides strong evidence against the caption's claim.  A fact-check from Snopes.com definitively refutes the narrative.  The external source confirms the video's authenticity, but it recontextualizes the event, placing it in Hong Kong during August 2019 â€“ before the COVID-19 pandemic. The event depicted is a protest, and the structures being damaged are identified as surveillance towers, not 5G towers. The high confidence score of 10 in the external check reflects the strong evidence against the original caption's claim.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nThere's a significant discrepancy between the original caption's narrative and the evidence provided by both internal and external checks. The internal check highlights the lack of visual confirmation about the specific structures and the absence of any COVID-19 connection.  The external check definitively refutes the claim, providing a much clearer picture of the video's origin and the context of the event.  The external validation overcomes the ambiguities within the internal analysis, clearly showing that the caption is out of context.\n\nVisual Evidence Analysis:\nThe video itself does not offer enough visual information to conclusively confirm or deny the original caption's claim.  The structures being damaged are not clearly identifiable. While the context suggests some type of protest, there is no clear indication of their location (China specifically), the type of structures (5G towers), or the link to COVID-19. The video on its own is insufficient to support the original claim.\n\nConclusion:\nConsidering the internal and external validation findings, it is concluded that the original news caption is out of context (OOC). The external fact-checking evidence significantly outweighs the uncertainties within the internal visual analysis.  The claim lacks supporting evidence, and there is a strong case that the video has been deliberately misinterpreted or misrepresented. The high confidence score of 10 reflects this certainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. Internal analysis finds ambiguity in the video's details, while external fact-checking definitively refutes the claim, providing a different context for the event shown."

        "date": "2021-05-15T03:47:24",
        "content": "A US envoy has arrived in Tel Aviv for de-escalation talks as unrest between Israel and the Palestinians continues.\nHady Amr will take part in talks with Israeli, Palestinian and UN officials and reinforce what US diplomats said was the need for a \"sustainable calm\".\nAn Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip killed 10 people on Saturday, while a Palestinian rocket killed a man in Israel.\nThis week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014.\nUS President Joe Biden made diplomatic phone calls to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. The international community has urged both sides to end the escalation.\nAt least 139 people have been killed in Gaza and nine in Israel since this fighting began on Monday. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead in Gaza, while Palestinian health officials say nearly half are women and children.\nThe flare-up of violence over the last six days came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem, which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nHow did the fighting escalate on Saturday?\nThirteen people died in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, with 10 killed by an Israeli air strike at a refugee camp west of Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said.\nA five-month-old baby is said to be the only survivor of that strike, found trapped in the rubble next to his dead mother. A number of people were also reported missing.\nAkram Farouq, 36, dashed out of his home in Gaza along with his family after a neighbour told him they had received a call from an Israeli officer warning their building would be hit, Reuters news agency reports.\n\"We haven't slept all night because of the explosions, and now I am out in the street with my wife and children, who are weeping and trembling,\" he said.\nAn estimated 10,000 Palestinians have left their homes in Gaza since Monday because of the conflict, according to the UN.\nSaturday also saw an Israeli air strike destroy a tower block in Gaza housing media organisations. No-one is known to have died in this attack.\nIsraeli officials reported about 200 rocket launches from Gaza overnight, with homes hit in the southern cities of Ashdod, Beersheba and Sderot.\nIn Beersheba, 19 people were taken to hospital after getting slightly hurt while running to shelters, and three suffered from shock, The Times of Israel reports.\nIn the afternoon, a rocket hit a street in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, killing a man. He was reportedly hit by shrapnel in his apartment.\nAbout 2,300 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel since Monday, with about 1,000 intercepted by missile defences and 380 falling short and dropping into Gaza itself, Israel's military says.\nThere had been concerns of heightened tensions on Saturday as Palestinians were commemorating what they call al-Nakba, the Catastrophe. It marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced or driven from their homes in the Arab-Israeli war, which began the day after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948.\nWhat happened to the Gaza tower block?\nOn Saturday afternoon, an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building housing media organisations, including The Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, plus a number of offices and apartments.\nIn a statement released shortly afterwards, the Israeli military said the building housed military assets belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. The building's landlord has denied this.\nThe Associated Press (AP) said the block was hit roughly an hour after Israeli forces ordered people to evacuate.\nThe news organisation's CEO, Gary Pruitt, said: \"This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life. A dozen AP journalists and freelancers were inside the building and thankfully we were able to evacuate them in time.\"\nWhat is the US envoy seeking to achieve?\nMr Amr's arrival comes ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on Sunday. The US embassy in Israel said the aim of his trip was to \"reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm\".\nMr Biden's administration has had to rapidly step up its game on the diplomatic front without a full team in place: there is not even a nominee yet for ambassador to Israel.\nMr Amr is a mid-level diplomat without the kind of rank held by special envoys in previous US administrations, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says.\nBoth sides need to be able to say they've won\nThe end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007.\nForeign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now.\nFor that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won.\nHamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem.\nIsrael will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is \"restore deterrence\". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that police used rubber bullets, stun grenades, and tear gas against protesters, resulting in the death of a passerby.  Both the internal and external validation checks strongly contradict this caption. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe image shows police officers armed with shotguns. There is no visual evidence of rubber bullets, stun grenades, or tear gas being used.  The scene depicts a tense situation, but the specific weaponry and the presence of casualties are not visually confirmed.  The claim of a passerby's death is entirely unsupported by the image's content.  The internal check gives a low confidence score (3) due to the lack of visual evidence to support the claim. \n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check also finds no supporting evidence for the caption's claims.  The external resources consulted focused on entirely different events, making any comparison or confirmation impossible.  The absence of any corroborating information from external sources significantly weakens the credibility of the caption.  The external check likewise assigns a low confidence score (3) because of the lack of external corroboration.\n\nDiscrepancies:\nThere is no disagreement between the internal and external checks. Both independently conclude that the caption's claims are unsupported by available evidence.  The absence of visual evidence of the mentioned weaponry and casualties within the image, combined with the complete lack of corroboration from external sources, leads to a strong conclusion that the caption is out of context.\n\nVisual Evidence Analysis:\nThe image focuses on a group of police officers carrying shotguns, positioned in a street with scattered debris.  While the scene suggests a conflict or protest, the specific details mentioned in the caption—the use of rubber bullets, stun grenades, tear gas, and a fatality—are absent from the visual evidence. No visual indications show the aftermath of these alleged events.  The image alone does not suggest the level of violence implied in the caption.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on both the lack of visual evidence within the image and the complete absence of external verification for the claims made, the caption is deemed to be out of context. The high level of discrepancy between the caption and the available evidence strengthens the conclusion. The overall confidence score reflects the strong support for the 'out of context' judgment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks found no evidence to support the original caption's claims regarding the use of rubber bullets, stun grenades, tear gas, and a fatality.  The image shows police with shotguns but lacks evidence for the other assertions. The external check revealed no relevant corroborating information."

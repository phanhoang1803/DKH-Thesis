However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks yield contradictory results regarding the accuracy of the caption \"Just a Bernie Sanders rally in California.\" The internal check, with a confidence score of 1, strongly refutes the caption.  It points out that the image depicts a massive rally in what appears to be Cuba, featuring a crowd size and setting drastically different from what would be expected at a typical Bernie Sanders rally in California.  The absence of any visual evidence supporting the claim, such as signage, banners, or the presence of Bernie Sanders himself, further weakens the caption's credibility.  \n\nConversely, the external check, with a high confidence score of 10, asserts the caption's accuracy. It cites evidence of multiple Bernie Sanders rallies held in California (Los Angeles and Sacramento),  implying that the caption might be referring to one of these events. The external check does not, however, present any visual evidence or contextual details supporting the connection between the image and these rallies.   \n\nThe discrepancy between these assessments arises from the fundamental conflict in the visual evidence presented in the image and the information provided by the external source.  The image shows an unmistakably large-scale gathering in a setting consistent with a public demonstration or parade.  While the external source confirms the occurrence of Bernie Sanders rallies in California, it does not provide any visual or contextual link to demonstrate that the image is in any way related to these events.  \n\nGiven that the external check lacks any visual proof to connect the image to the mentioned Bernie Sanders rallies, and the internal check presents strong visual and contextual evidence against it, the more reliable assessment comes from the internal validation. The sheer difference in the scale, location (Cuba versus California), crowd characteristics, and the total lack of any element identifying it as a Bernie Sanders rally clearly suggests that the caption is significantly out of context. The high confidence score in the external check seems solely based on the existence of Bernie Sanders rallies in California without substantiating the link to the provided image.\n\nTherefore, the caption is deemed out of context due to a lack of supporting visual evidence and the strong contradictory evidence from the visual analysis.  While it's possible that Bernie Sanders rallies occurred in California, the image does not depict any of these events. The external validation lacks the visual confirmation needed to outweigh the substantial visual and contextual contradictions observed in the internal validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly rejects the caption due to visual inconsistencies, while external validation asserts its accuracy based solely on the existence of unrelated Bernie Sanders rallies in California. The lack of visual connection between the image and the external claims renders the caption out of context."

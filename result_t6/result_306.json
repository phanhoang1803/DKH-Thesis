Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.\nDuring the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values.",

        "content": "Q: Did President Obama sign an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools?\nA: No. That claim comes from a satirical story on a fake news website.\nFULL QUESTION\nDid Obama sign Executive Order 13738, revoking the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance and banning it in public schools? Did he say the language of the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values?\nFULL ANSWER\nThe rumor that President Barack Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools originated from a satirical article posted last month by a fake news website under the headline Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. The site is designed to look like ABC News, but uses the URL abcnews.com.co, the first tip-off that this isnt a legitimate news site.\nThe made-up story begins: Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. It goes on to say the order makes it illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty, which also applies to public schools. Those who violate the order, the bogus story says, can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.\nThe satire becomes abundantly clear for those who read on. The story includes quotes from Sock it Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks and Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.\nAnd then theres this description of abcnews.com.co at the bottom:\nabcnews.com.co: Thanks to ABC News President & CEO, Dr. Paul Horner for making ABC News the greatest website in the universe.

Paul Horner is an internet satirist who has created many fake news websites, articles and hoaxes. He takes responsibility for the pledge article on another one of his websites. The phone number listed for the complaint department, as well as at the bottom of the article as an Obama administration hotline, is the number of the Westboro Baptist Church, which is best known for its anti-gay views and protests.\nAn executive order with the number 13738 does exist, but it deals with labor laws and the federal governments use of private contractors. It has nothing to do with the Pledge of Allegiance. Obama signed it on Aug. 23, and the text is available from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. The National Archives also publishes an official list of all executive orders issued by Obama.\nThere have been legal challenges, dating back decades, to school boards and other organizations that require the pledge to be recited, concerning the under God phrase or religious beliefs. The Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette in 1943 that it is unconstitutional to force children to recite the pledge in public schools. The court ruled that it violates their rights under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. But this does not make it illegal to display or recite the pledge, or to encourage it.\nSources\nObama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. abcnews.com.co. 31 Aug 2016.\nExecutive Order 13738 of August 23, 201.

    "explanation": "The original news caption, \"Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge of Allegiance in Schools Nationwide,\" is definitively false based on a strong convergence of internal and external evidence.  The internal check provides a confidence score of 10 and concludes that the image, showing Obama signing a document, does not support the caption's claim. The caption's assertion of a nationwide ban on the Pledge of Allegiance is not visually evident; the image only depicts a signing ceremony, offering no information about the document's content. This internal assessment is reinforced by an external check, which also achieves a perfect confidence score of 10.  External sources, including Snopes and FactCheck.org, explicitly debunk the claim, identifying it as a fabricated story circulated as fake news.  These sources trace the false claim to a satirical article from a fake news website, demonstrating that no such executive order ever existed.  The external sources further detail the origin and spread of this false narrative.  There is no discrepancy or uncertainty between the internal and external validation. Both unequivocally reject the caption's claim. The image itself is consistent with the external findings as it merely shows a signing ceremony devoid of any content-related information about the document. No visual tampering or miscontextualization is evident. In summary, there's complete agreement between the visual evidence, the internal textual analysis, and the external fact-checking sources. All indicators decisively confirm that the caption is entirely out of context and factually incorrect.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly and independently confirm that the caption is false. The image shows Obama signing a document, but provides no information on the document's content.  External sources conclusively identify the caption's claim as fake news originating from a satirical article. There is complete agreement and no discrepancies between the analyses."

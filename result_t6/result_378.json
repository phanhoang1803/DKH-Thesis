        "content": "Claim:\nHillary Clinton said children should be raised and trained by the state, and parents should have only a secondary role.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2016, a meme featuring a picture of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, along with a statement supposedly uttered by her about the role government should play in raising children, began to make the social media rounds:\nThis image was originally shared by the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr Page, one of many web sites dedicated to false information and misinformation about presidential candidates across the political continuum. Although the Tumblr page stated that their material consisted of \"100% sourced and verified quotes,\" we investigated several of the entries shared by that page and found all of them to be false.\nThe Tumblr page made its agenda clear in its description, \"Get to know the psychopath known as Hillary Clinton a little better.\"\nWe attempted to unearth this quote in the pages of Clinton's 1996 book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, but (unsurprisingly) came up empty-handed.\nThe only credible publication to connect this quote to Hillary Clinton was the Tallahassee Democrat. That connection, however, was posted on 26 October 2015 (a day after the putative quote appeared on the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr page) and appeared in the web site's \"Zing\" section, which features opinions and \"snappy one-liners\" from anonymous users.\nWhile it's true that Hillary Clinton published a book in 1996 called It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, it does not include the statement in question, and Clinton (a parent herself) has not said at any point that she believes children should be raised primarily by the state, with their parents taking a secondary role.",

      "explanation": "The claim that Hillary Clinton said children should be raised by the state is rated as false by Snopes.  Snopes investigates the origin of the quote, tracing it to a misinformation website and finding no credible evidence to support the claim.  Hillary Clinton has never made such a statement. ",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies Hillary Clinton in the image and notes the caption also mentions her.  However, this internal consistency is misleading. The external check, using Snopes, reveals the caption's claim—that Hillary Clinton stated children should be raised by the state—is demonstrably false.  Snopes provides evidence showing the quote's origin from unreliable sources and a lack of credible evidence supporting the assertion. This significant discrepancy highlights the caption's out-of-context nature. The image itself shows Hillary Clinton, but the caption attributes a statement to her that she never made. There's no visual evidence to support the claim.  Therefore, because the external check definitively refutes the caption's central claim with high confidence, and the internal check's consistency is shown to be based on a false premise, we conclude the caption is out of context. The confidence score is high because both the internal and external checks provide strong evidence, albeit leading to different initial conclusions, which are subsequently resolved by prioritizing the reliable external source.",

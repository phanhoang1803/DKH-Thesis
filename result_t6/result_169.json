Several disturbing images from the blackout went viral on social media. One image shared on several different Twitter accounts, however, had nothing to do with that power outage, despite claims to the contrary:\nThe author of the above tweet asserted this image to be taken in Texas during the 2021 blackouts, but this is impossible. The image used in that tweet has been on the internet for years.\nFor example, the image appears in a January 2018 article on EbaumsWorld titled \"36 Amusing Pictures That Will Destroy Your Boredom.\" It can be found, as well, in a December 2019 article about preventing frozen pipes on the website of the company Thompson Building Associates.\nBecause the photo predates the Texas blackout by several years, online claims linking it to current events in Texas are \"False.\"",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim that a photo of a large indoor icicle was taken during the Texas blackout in February 2021.  It explicitly states that this claim is FALSE. The article provides evidence that the image predates the Texas blackout by several years, appearing in online articles from 2018 and 2019.",

  },
  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal validation, based solely on the image, suggests a plausible connection to the Texas blackout due to the visual evidence of extensive ice formation inside a home, which is consistent with burst pipes during freezing temperatures. However, the external validation, specifically the Snopes fact-check, decisively refutes the claim. Snopes provides strong evidence that the image predates the February 2021 Texas blackout by several years, appearing in online articles as early as 2018 and 2019. This discrepancy between internal and external evidence necessitates a thorough analysis to determine the accuracy of the caption.  The internal assessment is limited by the lack of explicit information within the image itself regarding location and date, relying entirely on visual interpretation. This interpretation, while seemingly consistent with the scenario described in the caption, is insufficient to outweigh the concrete evidence provided by the Snopes fact-check. The high confidence score of 10 for both internal and external validations reflects the clarity and strength of the evidence from each check, allowing for a definitive conclusion despite the apparent contrast. The fact that a reliable source (Snopes) provides a documented and verifiable timeline that refutes the claim of the image being from the Texas blackout of 2021 overrides the visual interpretation. In summary, while the image itself appears to depict a situation consistent with the aftermath of a severe freeze, the external evidence overwhelmingly proves that this particular image is not from the February 2021 Texas blackout. Therefore, the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation based on visual interpretation initially suggests plausibility but is overridden by strong external evidence from Snopes that definitively proves the image predates the Texas blackout event. The discrepancy is resolved by prioritizing the verifiable external evidence over the visual interpretation."

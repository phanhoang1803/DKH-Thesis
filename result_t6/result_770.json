        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, involving doctors armed with weapons, gunshots to deter people from leaving a new coronavirus quarantine, and a woman who was shot dead after she attempted to break through a roadblock.\nWARNING: This article contains a video that shows a recently deceased person. As such, it may not be suitable for all viewers.\nIn February 2020, a video supposedly showing a chaotic scene in Wuhan, China, was widely shared on social media with the suggestion that it was related to the 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus.\nActor James Woods posted the video to his Twitter account, asking if anyone knew what was actually going on in this footage:\nAlthough the video attached to Woods' tweet was later removed, at the time of this writing it was still viewable on other Twitter posts.\nWhile the video was widely shared as if it showed a singular incident, it was actually made up of three individual and unrelated clips, which we evaluate separately below.\nClip 1\nAre these armed doctors?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe first clip in this video was widely shared along with the unfounded claim that it showed medical professionals armed with weapons. The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals.\nWhile we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word \"police\" can be briefly seen on the hood of this car.\nClip 2\nAre these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:\nNew video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. Therere multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.\nThere was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims.\nNobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed \"gunfire.\" This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year. One early posting of this footage noted that the explosions in the background were fireworks from the holiday celebration.\nClip 3\nWas a woman shot dead after attempting to break through a coronavirus blockade?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe final clip in this video supposedly shows a woman who was \"shot dead after she attempted to break the blockade set up to contain #coronavirus.\"\nThis is a genuine video. However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident.\nRemnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike.\nLes Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a \"one-vehicle road accident\":\n\"In the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.\"\nIn Summary\nAlthough Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.\nWhen we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator's assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be \"atypical\" for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.",

      "explanation": "The provided news caption is False. The Snopes article explicitly debunks the claim that a video shows guns and violence in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak in China.  The article breaks down the video into three separate clips, showing that each clip is miscaptioned and unrelated to the claims of violence related to the coronavirus outbreak. The first clip shows police officers in medical gear, not doctors with weapons. The second shows sounds that were likely fireworks, not gunshots, and the third depicts a motorcycle accident, not a shooting at a roadblock.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original news caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 1, clearly states that the image contains no guns or violence, directly contradicting the caption's claim. The explanation further supports this by describing the image content as depicting the aftermath of a natural disaster, with people providing aid and a police car present. This aligns perfectly with the external check's findings, which achieve a high confidence score of 10. The external check corroborates the internal assessment, providing detailed evidence from a Snopes article that debunks the caption's claim. The Snopes article meticulously analyzes three separate clips within the video, demonstrating that each clip is misrepresented in the caption.  The article reveals that the clips, instead of showing gun violence in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, depict: 1. Police officers in medical gear, misidentified as doctors with weapons; 2. Sounds that were likely fireworks, incorrectly interpreted as gunshots; and 3. A motorcycle accident, wrongly described as a shooting at a roadblock. The comprehensive evidence from both internal and external checks, consistently pointing towards a misrepresentation of the video's content, eliminates any ambiguity.  There's no internal or external conflict, and the visual evidence fully supports the conclusion that the caption is entirely false and out of context. The high confidence scores from both checks (1 and 10) further reinforce this conclusion.  No visual tampering or miscontextualization is detected; the discrepancies lie solely in the inaccurate interpretation of the video's contents. Therefore, a conclusive judgment that the caption is completely out of context is justified with high confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation unequivocally confirm that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The image depicts the aftermath of a disaster, not gun violence, as falsely claimed in the original caption.  The external check provides detailed evidence from Snopes that supports the internal assessment."

        "content": "Claim:\nThe 1990s movie \"Shazaam\" starred comedian Sinbad as a genie.\nOrigin\nA popular internet theory holds that actor David Adkins, better known as the comedian Sinbad, played a genie in a popular children's movie released sometime in the 1990s called \"Shazaam.\"\nThe movie Shazaam, from the 1990s, staring Sinbad was never a real movie. Myself and thousands of others remember watching this movie, but apparently it was never made.\nI've tried looking it up myself and haven't found anything about it. There is an article about the oddity that was on Facebook. Someone commented a screenshot of the vhs in the comments, but again, I could not find this picture on the internet myself.\nAlthough this movie does not actually exist, social media users have circulated an image in an attempt to fool viewers into believing the film is real:\nThe \"genie\" in the above-displayed image actually features the chest and arms of WWE wrestler Chavo Guerrero, with Sinbad's face digitally added to the scene:\nDespite the total lack of evidence that any such film starring Sinbad was ever made  no extant footage, no still shots documenting its creation, no news articles or movie reviews mentioning it, it has no entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and Sinbad himself has stated that he never played a genie in a movie called Shazaam  many people still they remember seeing the movie.\nBut why?\nWhile we cannot pinpoint an exact origin of this collective false memory, several circumstantial aspects suggest why people may mistakenly recall Sinbad's having starred in a genie movie.\nThe name: Depending on when you grew up, the name \"Sinbad\" likely recalls memories of one of two things: either a popular 1990s comedian, or a fictional sailor who had adventures (sometimes involving genies) in the Middle East. It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.\nSinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\" on TNT in 1994:\nKazaam: A simpler explanation is that some fans are misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s that featured a popular actor playing a genie. In 1996, Shaquille O'Neal essayed the role of a genie in the film \"Kazaam\":\nSinbad appeared in several popular childrens' movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for Kazaam was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie The First Kid:\nIt appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of the \"Mandela Effect,\" an informal term for a collective false memory. The term was coined by a woman who discovered that she and hundreds of other people believed, and remembered, that Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s. Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa's first black president and winning the Nobel Peace Prize (along with another former president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, who ended the system of segregation known in South Africa as apartheid during his time in power) in 1993  all of which, of course, would have been impossible if Mandela had been dead for a decade.\nSightings:",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check identifies the comedian Sinbad in the image and acknowledges the caption's mention of \"Shazaam.\" However, it notes the image's lack of movie-related context, resulting in a true verdict despite the absence of direct movie-related elements. The external check definitively refutes the caption's claim about \"Shazaam,\" citing Snopes.com's evidence that the movie never existed, and giving a false verdict. The discrepancy arises because the internal check focuses solely on the image's content, while the external check considers wider factual knowledge.  The external evidence is stronger since it provides definitive proof from a reputable source (Snopes) that contradicts the caption.  The image, while showing Sinbad, does not offer any proof of his involvement in a movie called \"Shazaam.\" The significant difference in confidence scores (10 for internal vs. 10 for external) reflects the varying scopes of the checks. The internal check only assesses the image against the caption, while the external check incorporates broader factual context from credible sources.  Based on the external evidence, which is more reliable and thorough, and the lack of any visual evidence in the image supporting the film's existence, we conclude that the caption is out-of-context. The visual analysis confirms Sinbad's presence, but it lacks any elements from the fictional movie \"Shazaam.\" The internal check's limited scope should not override the external check's stronger evidence. Therefore, combining the findings, we determine that the caption is factually incorrect and out-of-context, and the image does not provide any support for the claim made in the caption. No visual tampering or miscontextualization is detected; the image shows Sinbad genuinely but does not relate to the claimed movie.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found Sinbad but noted absence of \"Shazaam\" context. External check definitively proved \"Shazaam\" is a false memory, contradicting the caption.  External evidence is stronger and deems the caption OOC."

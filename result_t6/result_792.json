While it's plausible that such a claim circulated on social media in early 2021, the lack of evidence and the source's known unreliability make it highly improbable that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis actually used such language towards President Biden. The timeframe (early February 2021) is also verifiable.

    "explanation": "The image shows Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The caption claims that a story published by Real Raw News, a website known for unreliable reporting, stated that DeSantis told President Biden \"Go f--- yourself.\"  The image itself provides no evidence of this interaction; it only shows DeSantis speaking.  The internal check correctly identifies DeSantis in the image and notes the mention of Real Raw News and President Biden in the caption. However, it mistakenly gives a high confidence score (10). The external check provides a more accurate assessment. It points out that Real Raw News has a history of publishing false and misleading information, and there's no corroboration from reputable news sources to support the claim.  The external check's lower confidence score (8) reflects the uncertainty inherent in verifying a negative claim (i.e., proving something *didn't* happen). The external check highlights the improbability of such an event, given the formality of interactions between a governor and the president. While the caption is factually accurate in that a story with such a claim circulated on social media via Real Raw News, the core claim itself is highly dubious. Therefore, the caption is out of context in its implication of truth. The visual evidence only supports the presence of DeSantis; it doesn't support the controversial quote attributed to him. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks lies in the assessment of confidence. The internal check lacks awareness of Real Raw News' reputation for disseminating misinformation. Therefore, the final assessment leans towards the more cautious external assessment. Considering the unreliability of the source and lack of corroborating evidence, the claim is considered false, despite its circulation online.  The image is not manipulated or miscontextualized; however, its context is significantly misused in the given caption. The caption relies on an unreliable source, which, when combined with the absence of visual evidence supporting the controversial claim, makes it out of context. ",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation correctly identifies the presence of DeSantis in the image but overestimates the confidence. External validation highlights the unreliable source (Real Raw News) and the lack of corroborating evidence, correctly concluding that the caption's central claim is unlikely to be true.  The image does not contradict the caption's description of a claim circulating online; however, it does not visually support the claim's truthfulness."

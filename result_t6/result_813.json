    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows a moderate level of confidence (confidence score of 8) that the image depicts a Lime scooter, although it cannot confirm the location or date. However, the external check completely refutes the caption's claim.  It finds no supporting evidence for the Lime scooter being on the Embarcadero in San Francisco on April 16, 2018. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks is significant. While the image itself does show a Lime scooter, the lack of external corroboration regarding the specific location and date strongly suggests the caption is out of context.  The absence of any supporting evidence from external sources dramatically lowers the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy. There is no way to resolve this discrepancy without additional information. The image alone only provides visual confirmation of the scooter's brand, not its precise location or the date it was photographed. To improve the confidence score, further investigation would be needed to cross-reference the image with news articles, photo databases, or other sources that could place the scooter at the specified location and date.  Without such evidence, the claim remains unsubstantiated. Given the lack of external corroboration, the low confidence score of 2 reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding the caption's accuracy. The visual evidence, while suggestive of a Lime scooter, is not sufficient to override the absence of external support. Therefore, concluding that the caption is out of context is justified.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially supports the caption (Lime scooter visible), but the external check completely refutes it (no evidence of the scooter at specified location and date). This discrepancy leads to a low confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

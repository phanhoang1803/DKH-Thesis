        "content": "Claim:\nThe CDC readjusted the COVID-19 death toll from 60,000 down to 37,000.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAt the beginning of May 2020, widely circulated social media posts asserted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had substantially revised their figures for the number of deaths in the U.S. caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, from 60,000 down to about 37,000:\nThese posts fed into conspiracy theories holding that the COVID-19 pandemic was not nearly as serious as suggested by the government and the news media, and that the \"true\" mortality figures were being deceptively inflated to achieve some ulterior purpose.\nHowever, this claim was not true, and it was the result of comparing two separate data sources that report different measurements.\nThe link included in the above tweet points to the CDC's Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page, which provides provisional death totals by week and state according to the following criteria:\nThe provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; (a) by week ending date and (b) by specific jurisdictions.\nAs of May 1, 2020, that page reported the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. as being 37,308:\nHowever, that page also notes that the provisional data it displays are continually revised, may be incomplete, likely will not include more recent deaths, and may differ from other published sources because data currently are lagged by an average of 12 weeks:\nThe provisional counts for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 12 weeks.\nProvisional death counts may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Our counts often track 12 weeks behind other data for a number of reasons: Death certificates take time to be completed. There are many steps involved in completing and submitting a death certificate. Waiting for test results can create additional delays. States report at different rates. Currently, 63% of all U.S. deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, but there is significant variation among jurisdictions. It takes extra time to code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded manually, which takes an average of 7 days. Other reporting systems use different definitions or methods for counting deaths.\nThat 37,308 was not a drastic downward revision of any previously reported death total. Rather, it only might have seemed such because it was mistakenly compared to the number of deaths reported on the CDC's COVID-19 Cases in the U.S. page, which as of May 3, 2020, displayed a total of 65,735 deaths:\nWhy such a large discrepancy? Because as latter page's \"About the Data\" section explains, its data are updated daily based on \"Case notifications received by CDC from U.S. public health jurisdictions and the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)\" and includes \"both confirmed and probable deaths.\" This more up-to-date page will obviously report higher death figures that one whose data lag by 1-2 weeks.\nIndeed, two weeks earlier, the \"Cases in the U.S.\" page had displayed a total of 35,443 deaths, a number much closer to the 37,308 figure reported by the \"Provisional Death Counts\" with its 1-2 week data lag.\nIn short, this claim is like comparing stock prices from a two-week-old newspaper with those offered today by a cable news station, and then attributing any differences to a conspiracy rather than the mere passage of time as reflected in more current reporting.",

Snopes rates this claim as False, explaining that the discrepancy arose from comparing different data sources with different reporting lags and methodologies, not from a deliberate downward revision.  The explanation details how one source presented more current data, naturally resulting in a higher death toll compared to the other source, which had a significant reporting lag. The claim is deemed false because it misrepresented the reasons for the difference in numbers.",

    "explanation": "The image shows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) building.  The caption, however, claims that the CDC readjusted the COVID-19 death toll from 60,000 to 37,000. This claim is not visually supported by the image. The image provides no information about any specific COVID-19 statistics or data adjustments.  The internal check acknowledges the presence of entities related to \"CDC\" and \"COVID-19\" in the image and caption, but points out the crucial missing information: the death toll adjustment. It assesses that the core information about the death toll is absent from the image, giving it a confidence score of 8. The external check, using Snopes as a source, explicitly debunks the claim in the caption. It states that the difference in death toll numbers stemmed from comparing data sources with different reporting lags and methodologies, not from any official CDC revision. The external check concludes that the claim is false and has a confidence score of 8.  Both the internal and external checks agree that the caption's claim is unsubstantiated and inaccurate. The image merely depicts the CDC building; it does not offer evidence related to the claim of death toll readjustment.  The high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong agreement between the internal and external validation, indicating a clear case of an out-of-context caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly suggest that the caption is out of context. The image shows the CDC building, but contains no information on COVID-19 death tolls. External fact-checking confirms the falsity of the caption's claim regarding the death toll adjustment."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly suggest that the original news caption is out of context. The internal analysis reveals a lack of direct visual evidence supporting the claim of human waste dumping; the caption's assertion is based on inference, not direct observation. The confidence score of 3 reflects this uncertainty.  The external validation, leveraging a Snopes.com fact-check, provides compelling evidence contradicting the caption. Snopes explicitly labels the image as \"Miscaptioned,\" clarifying that the brown discoloration in the water is sand and mud stirred up by the ship's propellers, not human waste.  This external verification carries a confidence score of 2, indicating a moderate level of certainty in its findings.The combined evidence from both internal and external checks creates a strong consensus. There is no visual evidence of human waste discharge. The visual element shows a cruise ship near a cloudy patch of water. The internal analysis points to an inferential leap in the caption, while the external verification directly refutes the caption's claim, providing a clear alternative explanation.  Given the strong agreement between internal and external assessments and the absence of any visual evidence suggesting human waste dumping, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is highly probable. The discrepancy between the internal and external confidence scores reflects the difference in the nature of the evidence. The internal check focuses on the direct visual evidence, leading to a lower confidence due to the absence of explicit confirmation. The external check, by citing a reputable source (Snopes), offers stronger evidence, justifying the higher overall confidence score. There is no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image itself seems genuine, but the caption's interpretation of the scene is demonstrably inaccurate.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations concur that the caption is out of context.  Internal analysis finds no direct visual evidence of waste dumping, while external fact-checking confirms the image is miscaptioned, identifying the brown water as stirred-up sediment, not human waste."

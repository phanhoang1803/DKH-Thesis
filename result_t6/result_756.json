It has a mesh lining thats airy and breathable, butdespite its active vibelacks armpit zips for venting.\nIf youre looking for a casual rain jacket that wont break the bank, this Columbia shell (available as the Womens Arcadia II Jacket and the Mens Watertight II Jacket) ticks all the boxes. Its lightweight nylon is well suited for active adventures and moderate climates; it can also be worn over warmer layers. The Columbia rain jacket comes in a wider range of sizes and colors than any of our other picks. One panelist said, It may not light anyones world on fire, but it wont disappoint.\nIt really is watertight. We wore the Columbia rain jacket under a running shower for three minutes, and not a drop penetrated the two-layer construction (which uses Columbias proprietary Omni-Tech waterproof technology). The jacket has storm flaps covering its zippers, and its fully seam-sealed to prevent water from penetrating tiny stitch holes.\nThe hood got mixed reviews. Some testers noted that it directed water away from their faces without reducing visibility. But its smaller than the hoods on our other picks, and its length isnt adjustable, so its efficacy is fairly head-dependent.\nThe material moves and breathes. Rain jackets are often stiff and confining, but the Columbia rain jacket is silky and fluid. My range of motion in it is great, said one tester. My arms and shoulders feel free and loose.\nPanelists praised the soft and airy mesh lining. One tester whos had the mens version since 2019and said its holding up greatwears his for outdoor work. Its breathable, and it doesnt [make me] clammy. (Another tester disagreed, claiming the jacket created a moist, chilly microclimate.)\nThe Columbia rain jacket doesnt have armpit zips for releasing heat. None of our testers missed themeven while mowing the lawnbut if youre active, you may prefer a shell with more ventilation.\nIts practical and packable. This jacket isnt fancy, but its basic features get the job done. Testers liked the Columbia rain jackets roomy, well-positioned vertical zippered pockets. The zippers operate smoothly, thanks to long pulls, and its hood and bottom hem cinch via elastic cords. The Velcro-style, hook-and-loop closures at the cuffs and over the front zipper didnt impress ustheyre noisy and look cheapbut theyre quicker than snaps.\nThe Columbia rain jacket is the lightest of our picks and packs down into its own left-hand pocket. The process (video) is somewhat onerous (and instructions are not included), but the result is a totable 8-by-6-inch parcel.\nIts casual and outdoorsy. It comes in over a dozen solid colors and has a trim, hip-length silhouette that can go from grocery store to trailhead. Even though its sporty, it doesnt scream performance, said one tester. Still, its decidedly casualwe wouldnt wear it to work or a nice restaurant.\nIts flattering and size inclusive. This jacket is neither overly boxy nor especially body conscious, and testers of different heights and sizes responded well to its cut. You can see the shape of the person inside it, said Wirecutter supervising style editor Ingela Ratledge Amundson.\nOne tester (5-foot-2, womens size XL) remarked, The fit is perfect, with room for a hoodie underneath. Another (5-foot-9, mens size M) gave the fit high marks but noted that the shoulders felt a touch narrow. We found the fit true to size, though you may want to size up if youd like more room for layering.\nThis jacket is offered in the widest size range of any of our picks: The womens version comes in regular and plus sizes, and the mens is available in regular, big, and tall sizes.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe hood is on the smaller side, and its length isnt adjustable.\nThe jacket doesnt have armpit zips for venting.\nIts hook-and-loop closures are scratchy, loud, and unattractive.\nThe mesh lining in the pockets catches on things like rings and keys.\nPacking the jacket into its pocket can be tricky.\nSpecs\nSizes: Arcadia II womens XSXXL, plus 1X3X; Watertight II mens SXL, big 1X6X, tall LT5XT\nColors: 12+\nVariants: none\nMaterial: outer 100% nylon; lining 100% nylon; mesh lining 100% polyester\nWeight: Arcadia II is 11.2 ounces; Watertight II is 13 ounces\nCare: machine wash cold, tumble dry low\nReturns and warranty: 60-day returns, limited lifetime warranty for defects\nBest for\nThis well-made mid-length fishermans coat has a charming retro appeal and is terrific for commuting. Made from polyurethane that has a pleasantly rubbery feel, its PFC-free and 100% waterproof, but its not as breathable as our other picks.\nThis well-made mid-length fishermans coat has a charming retro appeal and is terrific for commuting. Made from polyurethane that has a pleasantly rubbery feel, its PFC-free and 100% waterproof, but its not as breathable as our other picks.\nThe Helly Hansen Moss Raincoat (womens, mens) has classic fisherman coat styling, with a long, straight cut and plenty of old-school charm (think: Singin in the Rain). Its made from pleasantly rubbery PFC-free (perfluorochemical-free) polyurethane, so its waterproof in the heaviest rain, and it has a satisfying heft thats welcome in cooler climes. But its not particularly breathable; wed choose a different coat for warm weather or strenuous activities.\nIts retro cool. The Moss Raincoat is a quintessential slicker, inspired by Helly Hansens original fishermans coats from the 1950s. It feels nostalgic, but in a stylish, in-the-know way, says Wirecutter supervising style editor Ingela Ratledge Amundson.\nIts fabric is totally waterproof, but it traps heat. This raincoats polyurethane exterior and welded seams offer exceptional rain and wind protection. The fabric itself is completely waterproofno moisture seeped in during our shower testingand unlike most rain jackets, it doesnt rely on forever chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, aka PFAS or PFCs) to repel liquids.\nThe downside of polyurethane: It isnt breathable. I got clammy after about 10 minutes of just sitting, said one tester. Vents in the polyester lining and a rear cape vent provide some airflow, but this isnt the jacket for warm, humid conditions or cardio.\nIt has a unique, rubberized texture. Most testers loved the Moss Raincoats slightly stretchy, rubbery material. It has an elegant matte finish and a light, flexible drape. The fabric is incredibly comfy, said a panelist. It feels sturdy, but its soft and easy to move in.\nIts long and roomy. This coat has a straight, slouchy cut that leaves room for layering. Its just oversized enough, says senior style editor Jennifer Hunter (5-foot-9, womens M). Our 6-foot-tall womens S tester complained about the proportionsparticularly the three-quarter-length, Audrey Hepburn sleeves, declaring, This isnt for tall people. The sleeves on the mens version are 2 inches longer. The womens version also comes in a more limited size range than our other picksup to an XL. The mens version goes up to 2XL.\nThis is the longest womens coat we recommend, falling just above the knee on our 5-foot-6, size M tester. The mens Moss jacket is 3 inches shorter but was still upper-thigh length on our 5-foot-9 tester.\nIt gets most details rightbut not the pockets. The Moss Raincoat feels durable and well constructed. The hood kept us dry without blocking our view; its length isnt adjustable, but it can be cinched via old-school drawstrings. The YKK zipper runs smoothly. And the coat comes with a thoughtful repair kit in case you ever need a polyurethane patch.\nAlas, the pockets are a miss. Awkwardly located on the front of the coat and covered with flaps that are pinned down on the sides, they keep your stuff dry, but theyre hard to wriggle into. Also, the storm flap and cuffs are secured by snaps rather than hook-and-loop closures. Snaps are a little fussy, and because each cuff has only one setting, you may not get a tight seal.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe polyurethane material isnt breathable.\nThe size range is less inclusive than our other picks.\nThe pinned pockets are annoying.\nThe cuffs and storm flap are secured by snaps; hook-and-loop closures are easier.\nSpecs\nSizes: womens XSXL; mens S2XL\nColors: womens version has one; mens version has two\nVariants: short rain jacket (womens, mens)\nMaterial: outer 100% polyurethane (PFC-free); lining 100% polyester\nWeight: 2 pounds\nCare: machine wash warm, air-dry\nReturns and warranty: 30-day returns, one-year warranty against defects\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\nBest for\nThis durable, waterproof polyester raincoat is a utility player, equally well suited for an office commute, outdoor adventure, or evening excursion. Its hourglass shape, pleated back vent, and mid-thigh length were particularly popular with curvy testers, but not everyone loved the cut and fit.\nIf youre after one womens raincoat that can do it all, the light-to-medium weight L.L.Bean Womens H2Off Mesh-Lined Rain Jacket is about as adaptable as it gets. Functional and cute, it can pass for casual, outdoorsy, or work-ready. It has an hourglass silhouette that curvier testers especially loved; others didnt find the cut as flattering, but everyone agreed on its quality and versatility.\nThe H2Off jacket is also available in a winter-ready PrimaLoft-lined version and a longer, mid-thigh-length model.\nIts a style chameleon. Some rain jackets are emphatically sporty; others would look nice at the office, weird on a nature walk. But the H2Off can shape-shift. Its functional enough for hikes or weekend errands, and it has enough stylish details to wear out to dinner, said one tester.\nIts more waterproof than it looks. Although the H2Offs satiny polyester exterior looks like regular fabric, it has a durable water-repellent (DWR) finish, and the jackets interior membrane is fully seam-taped to keep water out. An airy mesh lining feels soft and cool against the skin. This coat is warmer than our shell pick from Columbia but more breathable than our heavier Helly Hansen pick.\nThe H2Off jacket kept us dry in our three-minute shower test. No water penetrated the inner membrane, but the exterior fabric did start to absorb moisture under the heavy water pressure; as this coat wets out, it gets less breathable.\nIts functional and user-friendly. Testers dug the H2Offs large, protective hood, which is adjustable with elastic cords around the face and a Velcro back tab. The coat also has a two-way zipper, so you can make fit adjustments if you need more range of motion or room to sit.\nThe H2Off has an interior zippered pocketits large enough for a phone or slim walleta handy (and curiously rare) feature for a raincoat. The in-line hand pockets are roomy and well placed, but they dont have closures, so theyre not very secure or watertight.\nThis coat has snaps (versus more user-friendly Velcro) for securing the storm flap that covers its zipper and for tightening the cuffs. As one tester put it, Snaps are a nuisance.\nIt has an hourglass silhouette. The H2Off is cut generously up top, with a closer-fitting waist that can be further cinched with interior elastic pulls. A pleated back vent flares subtly around the hips and rear. I like the slight curve at the waist, and I love the just-past-the-hip length, said one tester (5-foot-5, size XL). And its roomy enough to accommodate a large bust.\nThe H2Off jacket comes in an inclusive range of regular, plus, and petite sizes. Even so, it didnt work for all of our panelists. The proportions were comically off on our 6-foot-tall, size S tester: It looked like an empire-waist minidress with sleeves 4 inches too short. They should make this coat in tall sizes!\nIts well made. The coats stitching is neat and reinforced in the right spots, and the YKK zippers and Prym snaps are high quality. One panelist has owned her H2Off for five years and said it doesnt have noticeable wear and tear, even after numerous washings.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe outer fabric wets out in heavy rain, which makes the coat less breathable.\nThe hand pockets have no closures.\nThe cuffs and storm flap are secured by snaps; Velcro is easier.\nSpecs\nSizes: womens XSXL, petite XSXL, plus 1X3X\nColors: four\nOther options: mid-thigh length, PrimaLoft-lined hip length, PrimaLoft-lined mid-thigh length\nMaterial: outer 100% polyester; lining 100% nylon\nWeight: 1.44 pounds\nCare: machine wash warm, tumble dry low\nReturns and warranty: one-year satisfaction guarantee\nWomens and mens styles\nIf you want a PFC-free Gore-Tex shell (and dont mind some extra crinkle): The Arcteryx Beta Jacket (womens, mens) is one of the first premium Gore-Tex jackets out there to be made without PFAS and PFCs (aka forever chemicals)a pretty exciting development. Compared with the Arcteryx Beta LT Jacket (above), the Beta has a longer, boxier cut, with more room for layering; it also has a smaller hood (which cant accommodate a snow helmet) and lacks armpit zips. On the plus side, it weighs even less than the already light LT, has larger hand pockets, offers a tougher (though not quite as smooth) front zipper, and sports a handy interior pocket. And its $50 cheaper. The most important difference, however, lies in the material: The Betas three-layer construction consists of a PFC-free Gore-Tex ePE (expanded polyethylene) membrane, sandwiched between a durable nylon outer fabric and a soft, breathable knit backing. Like traditional Gore-Tex, the ePE membrane seals out the heaviest rain and wind while still allowing water vapor (read: your sweat) to escape. But the Betas fabric is notably stiffer and noisier than the LTs, and it feels less luxurious. Its not quite as loud and papery as the Patagonia Torrentshell 3Lanother PFC-free optionbut its close.\nIf you want an iconic, buy-it-for-life waxed-cotton jacket: The corduroy collar. The tartan lining. That waxed-cotton finish. The Barbour jacket has been around since 1894. Today, it looks equally at home in Brooklyn and Balmoral Castle. We tested the Beaufort Waxed Jacket, a classic mens shooting jacket; the Bedale Waxed Jacket, a shorter, lighter mens riding jacket; and the Beadnell Waxed Jacket, a womens version of the Bedale jacket (along with matching hoods, sold separately). Panelists praised the jackets style and comfortIts just as amazing as I imagined, said a Beaufort jacket fanthough one tester found the fabric oily and off-putting. (Upkeep and price are factors to keep in mind.) In our shower test, the Beadnell style kept us unexpectedly dry, though some dampness penetrated the outer layer; waxed cotton isnt nearly as waterproof as our picks. So although we adore these Barbour models, we consider them less rain jackets than terrific jackets that can be worn in the rain.\nIf you want a sporty, PFC-free shell thats ecologically responsible (but stiff and noisy): The lightweight Patagonia Torrentshell 3L Rain Jacket (womens, mens) is a packable, breathable, waterproof shell. Its made in a Fair Trade Certified factory from recycled nylon thats free of PFAs and PFCs (aka forever chemicals), and it has a well-fitting adjustable hood and armpit zips for venting. The Torrentshell 3L was previously a pick in this guide, but upon retesting it, we found it baggier and less flattering than our Columbia shell pick. Also, we couldnt get past its bewilderingly stiff material, which felt more like rough paper than fabric and rustled loudly as we moved. But if buying from a company with leading environmental initiatives is a top priorityand the fabric doesnt bother youits a solid, attractive jacket.\nWomens styles\nIf you want a splurge-worthy, next-level Gore-Tex shell: The sleek, lightweight Arcteryx Beta LT Jacket (womens) is, at around $450, wildly expensive. Its also outstanding. Its three-layer, ultra-breathable Gore-Tex construction seals out warm rains without overheating. Layered over a sweater or fleece, it keeps chilly winds at bay. While its equipped to handle the backcountryit has two-way armpit zips for releasing heat, a fully adjustable hood thats large enough to fit over a ski helmet, and easy-to-use cinches at the wrists and bottom hemthe fitted, flattering cut is stylish enough to turn heads in any city. Meticulously executed details, such as smoothly gliding laminated zippers, a microsuede lining at the chin, and well-placed hand pockets, make this jacket a pleasure to wear. At this writing, the womens version of the Beta LT is still available for purchase; however, the design is being phased out in favor of the PFC-free Arcteryx Beta SL Jacket (womens, mens), previously called the Beta Lightweight Jacket. Though we opted not to test this jacketat $500, its just too expensivewe did try the new, PFC-free version of the companys popular Beta Jacket.\nIf you want a sleek, stylish, and soft womens raincoat that can be dressed up or down: The Lululemon Rain Rebel Jacket is a buttery-soft, lightweight polyester coat with a graceful, mid-thigh-length silhouette. Our panelists found it flattering and comfy. The Rain Rebel Jacket has very long sleeveswhen cuffed, they reveal reflective Lululemon logosan adjustable hood, a cinchable waist, a two-way zipper, and zippered pockets (including an internal one). It comes in womens sizes 0 through 20, but at the time of testing, it was out of stock in sizes over 14, so we werent able to assess the fit on a range of body types. At the time of publication, its offered in six colors, including black and off-white.\nMens styles\nIf you want a heavyweight mens workwear-style rain jacket: The Carhartt Mens Storm Defender Loose Fit Heavyweight Jacket is made from tough wind- and waterproof nylon. It kept us warmer than any other jacket we tried, and it passed our shower test with flying colors (while remaining breathable). Testers appreciated the generous fit, workwear styling, abundant pocketsthree exterior and one interiorand standout features, including stretchy storm cuffs and a detachable hood. Its reasonable price was a pleasant surprise, too. But the Storm Defender jacket is oddly specific: Its too heavy for spring and summer rains, yet not insulated enough for weather below about 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Still, for a cool, stormy dayespecially one spent toiling outsideits spot-on.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\nSince this guide was first published in 2019and then fully updated in 2024weve researched nearly 200 raincoats and rain jackets and tested more than 50. In 2024 alone, we considered 71 womens, mens, and unisex options, and we tried 22.\nNote: For the purposes of this guide, were defining jackets as shorter, waist and hip-length options; coats are longer.\nA panel of testers wore the coats and jackets and provided detailed feedback. It consisted of five women (ranging in height from 5-foot-2 to 6 feet, womens sizes S to XL) and five men (5-foot-7 to 6 feet, mens sizes M to XXL). Not every panelist wore every model, but all of our picks were tested by at least five individuals.\nWe judged each garment according to the following criteria:\nRain protection: A raincoat has to keep you dry. Its ability to do so is determined by various factors (fabric, features), but we wanted proof. So the guide author wore each 2024 contender under a running shower for three minutesthe equivalent of being doused with 7.5 gallons of water. When the weather cooperated, we also wore the jackets in the rain.\nStyle: We scoped out a variety of styles and lengthsfrom sporty shells to polished longer coats to ponchosbut whatever the genre, we wanted the garment to look good. We only tested options with hoods (sorry, trench lovers) and excluded water-repellent winter coats, since theyre a category unto themselves.\nComfort: The properties that make rain gear waterproof can also make it an unventilated hotbox. Panelists assessed each jacket for breathability, comfort, and ease of movement under different conditions. We also rated the fabrics and liners.\nFit: We looked for jackets that fit and flattered people of varying sizes and body shapes.\nUser-friendliness: We hunted for jackets with intuitive features that would be a pleasure to own, and tested hoods, closures, pockets, adjustments, packability, and more.\nQuality: We looked for durable, high-performing fabrics; neatly finished, fully taped seams; and well-made, functional hardware. We also checked warranty policies.\nPrice: Theres no right price for a raincoatclimate, budget, and how highly you value rainwear all matter. We sought out inexpensive options that could meet our criteria and also entertained some spendy ones, capping our budget at $450 (because thats plenty for something fantastic).\nWhat about PFAS and PFCs in raincoats?\nMost rain gear owes its effectiveness to water-repellent chemical compounds known as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)also referred to as PFCs (perfluorochemicals; PDF) or forever chemicals. PFAS have been linked to health risks including cancer, pregnancy complications, and weakened immune function.\nPFAS are very commontheyre found in everything from furniture and cookware to drinking water and soil. Experts say that limited use of any single product is unlikely to expose you to dangerous PFAS levels; the risk is due to continued, cumulative exposure from many sources.\nIf you want to limit your exposure, we have some PFAS-free options in this guide. One of our top picks, the Helly Hansen Moss Raincoat, is made of polyurethane. And the Arcteryx Beta Jacket, the waxed-cotton Barbour jackets, and the Patagonia Torrentshell 3L Rain Jacketfeatured in the Other rain jackets and raincoats worth considering sectionare also free of PFAS.\nThis is not a comprehensive list of everything we tested in previous iterations of this guide, just whats still available.\nUnisex styles\nWe tested two options from Danish rainwear specialist Rains: the knee-length Long Jacket and poncho-style Cape. Both are constructed from a polyurethane-coated polyester that made us instantly sweaty, and it smelledalarminglylike fish.\nThe recycled polyester Rainkiss Rain Poncho is a voluminous, one-size-fits-all calf-length poncho that comes in assorted mood-lifting patterns. Its strangely delightfulour 6-foot-tall womens tester gave it a resounding ponch-hell-YESbut most panelists were deterred by its overwhelming proportions. And since its a pullover, youll get wet as you take it off.\nThe Stutterheim Stockholm Lightweight Raincoat, a PVC-coated polyester coat with a thigh-length, Scandi-minimalist silhouette, was the most fashionable garment we tested. But its open pockets filled with water in both our shower test and the actual rain.\nWomens and mens styles\nThe Cotopaxi Cielo Rain Jacket (womens, mens) is a sporty recycled polyester shell; it has a PFC-free DWR finish and a fun, color-blocked design. But we found it boxy and unflattering.\nThe PFC-free recycled nylon Marmot PreCip Eco Jacket (womens, mens) is a slim, trail-ready jacket with nice featuresincluding an adjustable hood and armpit zipsthat our similar Columbia pick lacks. But the Marmot jacket comes in fewer sizes, costs around $20 more, and made us feel clammy.\nWe liked the comfy mesh lining of the polyester REI Co-op Trailmade Rain Jacket (womens, mens); we werent fans of the shells wide, shapeless cut. The REI Co-op Rainier Rain Jacket (womens, mens), a recycled nylon shell, was more streamlined, but the unlined interior made us sweat.\nWomens styles\nThe mid-thigh-length polyester Eddie Bauer Womens Girl On The Go Insulated Trench Coat is a former pick. Its button-in liner makes it better suited for cold than our womens L.L.Bean pick, but its not as stylish or water repellent, and the cuffs cant be cinched.\nThe cotton-nylon blend, hip-length Eddie Bauer Womens Charly Jacket wasnt breathable and offered less tush coverage than the L.L.Bean Womens H2Off Mesh-Lined Rain Jacket.\nThe mid-thigh-length cotton/nylon Ellos Snap-Front Hooded Raincoat is cute, but the upper arms were so tight, we could barely move.\nThe hip-length nylon Lands End Womens 3-in-1 Squall Jacket has a bulky, uncomfortable fleece insert. Even without it, the jacket was tight in the arms.\nTesters struggled to find their correct fit with the mid-thigh-length, recycled nylon L.L.Bean Womens Trail Model Rain Coat; also, they were expecting higher quality.\nMens styles\nSome testers were into the workwear look (and the four large front cargo pockets) of the nylon Duluth Trading Company Mens No-Rainer Jacket, others found it too young. Everyone disliked the unlined interior.\nThe L.L.Bean Mens Trail Model Rain Jacket looks similar to our Columbia shell pick, but it comes in fewer sizes. Some customers complained that it runs small.\nThis article was edited by Ingela Ratledge Amundson and Jennifer Hunter.",

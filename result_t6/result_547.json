It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

    "explanation": "The internal validation correctly identifies Jodie Foster in the image and the quote attributed to her. However, the external validation, using a Snopes fact-check, definitively proves the quote is false and not attributable to Jodie Foster.  The high confidence score from the internal check is misleading because it relies solely on the visual content and the textual information within the image, without considering external sources of truth. The external validation provides strong evidence that contradicts the claim in the original caption.  The image, while featuring Jodie Foster, is misrepresenting her words. Therefore, the caption is demonstrably out of context. There is no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization within the image itself; the issue lies entirely in the fabricated quote.  The discrepancy highlights the critical importance of corroborating internal validation with reliable external sources when assessing the truthfulness of information presented in an image.  In this case, the external fact-check carries significantly more weight due to its independent verification process and its explicit debunking of the quote's authenticity.  Given the conclusive nature of the external evidence, the final assessment strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from the Snopes fact-check and the lack of any countervailing external or visual evidence.",

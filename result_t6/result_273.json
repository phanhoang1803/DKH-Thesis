On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

The fact-check rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned\" and explains that the photo depicts a 12-year-old Brazilian girl with an enlarged liver and spleen, not a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man.

    "explanation": "The original news caption claiming that the photograph shows a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal validation finds the image inconsistent with the caption.  The image shows a young girl with a visibly distended abdomen, which could be attributed to various medical conditions rather than pregnancy. There is no visual evidence supporting the claim of sexual assault or pregnancy. The age of the girl is not discernible from the picture alone. The mention of a \"Muslim man\" adds an element of religious bias that is completely unsupported by the image. \n\nThe external validation strongly refutes the claim. Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks the claim. Their investigation reveals that the image depicts a 12-year-old girl in Brazil suffering from a medical condition affecting her liver and spleen. This information contradicts the caption's assertions on both the girl's age and the cause of her abdominal distention. The fact-check also points out the malicious use of the image to spread Islamophobic narratives, highlighting the deliberate misrepresentation involved.\n\nThere is a complete and unambiguous mismatch between the image's visual content and the caption's narrative. The internal analysis identifies significant inconsistencies within the caption and the visual evidence, suggesting that the caption lacks supporting visual evidence. The external check's findings provide definitive proof that the caption is a fabrication, deliberately misrepresenting the circumstances and the identity of the young girl in the picture.  The external evidence not only refutes the caption but also exposes the harmful intent behind disseminating such misinformation.\n\nThe high confidence score (10) stems from the strong agreement between the internal and external validations, combined with the external source's credibility. The absence of any visual cues suggesting pregnancy or sexual assault in the image, along with the conclusive fact-check from a reliable source, leaves no room for doubt that the caption is out of context and intentionally misleading.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly reject the original caption.  Internal analysis finds no visual evidence supporting the claim, while external fact-checking definitively proves the caption is a fabrication used to spread misinformation."

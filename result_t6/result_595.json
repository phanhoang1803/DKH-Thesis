On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

Snopes explicitly states that the photograph is miscaptioned and does not depict a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man. The fact-check details that the image is of a 12-year-old Brazilian girl with a liver and spleen condition, and the claim is connected to Islamophobic rumors.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The claim that the image depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  Internal analysis reveals that the image shows a young girl with a significantly distended abdomen, which is consistent with a medical condition rather than pregnancy. The image itself provides no information about the girl's age, identity, or the cause of her abdominal distention.  Therefore, the caption's claim is entirely unsupported by the visual evidence.  Furthermore, external verification through fact-checking websites, such as Snopes.com, definitively refutes the caption's assertion.  Snopes' investigation confirms that the image is miscaptioned; it shows a 12-year-old Brazilian girl suffering from a liver and spleen condition. The false claim of pregnancy and its association with a Muslim man are linked to the spread of Islamophobic rumors.  The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement between internal visual analysis and the results of reputable external fact-checking.  There is no visual evidence supporting the claims in the caption; conversely, the external evidence powerfully refutes them. The significant discrepancy in age (9 vs. 12) further weakens the original caption's credibility.  The external source's thorough investigation and explanation regarding the girl's medical condition provide irrefutable evidence against the original claim.  In conclusion, the original caption is entirely out of context.  It is a fabrication based on a misrepresentation of a medical image and used to promote a harmful Islamophobic narrative. The internal analysis supports this conclusion by identifying the lack of visual evidence for the pregnancy claim, reinforcing the external fact-checking results and leading to a high confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly refute the original caption. Internal analysis finds no visual evidence to support the claim, while external fact-checking reveals the image's true context: a 12-year-old girl with a medical condition, not a pregnant child. The false narrative is tied to Islamophobic misinformation."

It was a gamble that often resulted in a flood of cases, especially in the South and parts of the Southwest, where health care workers are now battling outbreaks they hoped would never reach them.\nUpdated August 1, 2020\nWhen the virus came, I volunteered in Brooklyn as soon as I could. I went from being a surgeon to learning about pulmonary critical care.\nThe handful of shifts that I contributed to were truly humbling.\nI moved to Savannah to start a job down here in the midst of a resurgence. I am back on the general surgery service, so I am not as involved with the critical care though we do get called for the Covid-19 patients that need tracheostomies.\nA lot of people here have complained about masks and have the attitude that this is more of a common cold. But others are frustrated that officials down here arent being more aggressive in protecting the public.\nAdmissions and I.C.U. upgrades are increasing daily.\nThings have really ramped up in Phoenix. Were seeing large spikes in cases and hospitalizations. We are tight on I.C.U. beds and need more I.C.U. nurses to care for these patients. We are stretching these ratios, picking up extra shifts and doing all we can to make it work.\nWe run from one thing to the next all day and go to bed to do it all again the next day.\nWeve become each others family, since many of us havent seen our actual families in months.\nWe see these patients, young and old, come in begging us to save their lives. We do the best we can, but this terrible virus takes too many.\nOur state opened too quickly with little planning in place. We saw large groups of people together in high-risk activities.\nWe have seen patients who thought it was a hoax and quickly changed their tune. I hope theyll help spread the truth.\nMichael Starghill Jr. for The New York Times\nOur hospitals are full. Were running out of respiratory equipment. Our nurses and technicians are succumbing to the virus, and this is exacerbating the scarcity of health care personnel when theyre needed the most.\nMany of our patients are poor, Hispanic individuals, anywhere from 20 to 50 years old, who need I.C.U. support. Most are construction workers, handymen, janitors and restaurant servers.\nOn a recent night, four of the patients with Covid-19 that required hospitalization were in their 30s and 40s. They came in gasping for air  two men, two women; three Hispanic and one African-American.\nThree were essential workers  working at a fast-food chain, a garbage disposal and construction. The other worked for a haughty boss who wouldnt shut down a nonessential business. All worked part-time for minimal wages.\nDespite the gravity of their illnesses, all were anxious about how many days of missed work and pay this illness would translate into.\nThe tears in their eyes reflected not only the fear of their lungs drowning in the cytokine storm but also the struggle to keep fighting the whirlpool of social inequity.\nAndrea Morales for The New York Times\nShe was fighting back tears. I looked frantically for a box of tissues. Gauze was the best that I had. I ripped open the package, apologized for the rough gauze and lightly dabbed at her tears.\nMy husband and son have to get tested, she said. Theyve been taking care of me.\nI promised her that Id call her husband. Her phone started ringing. I asked her if she wanted to answer it. She said no, and just cried harder.\nDo you want me to pray? She could only nod her head and cry. Dear Heavenly Father, I began.\nShe was scared, and I was scared for her. There was nothing left that I could do. It would be up to God to heal her.\nBecause she was a Black female with asthma and high blood pressure, the odds were stacked against her. She was already on a mask for oxygen.\nHer Covid-19 test returned as positive. She died a few days later.\nCovid-19 has shaken me to my core. I feel like an intern again. My days off have been filled with paralyzing anxiety.\nI watched my colleagues in Detroit, New York and New Orleans wading through seas of sick patients. I worried that Memphis would also be overrun. I was scared that my majority Black city would see hundreds of casualties, that I too would run an I.C.U. and the patients would look just like me.\nOur numbers are climbing right now. When I worked the other night, there were no I.C.U. beds and we started holding patients in the E.R.\nThat days handoff felt different. The number of patients who were positive for Covid-19 or were admitted to the hospital for respiratory illnesses was far greater than numbers that I had seen in weeks. All of our isolation rooms were full and patients were in the hallways coughing.\nMy heart sank. On my way to work, I have seen crowds of Atlantans out in public spaces, without masks and without concern for social distancing practices. I have seen friends and acquaintances posting photos from crowded beaches and large family gatherings on social media.\nWe started out in this pandemic as front-line heroes. Even though the fanfare has gone, we will still be there at the other end of the social gatherings and the disregard for social distancing.\nWhile everyone is anxious to get back to their normal lives, there is no end in sight for those of us in the emergency department. There is no escape from the stress and mental fatigue that comes with witnessing such levels of death and tragedy.\nI remember telling a family that their sister had likely died due to complications from coronavirus.\nWe told her she should have come in sooner! her brother screamed. We wanted her to come in, but she just wanted to tough it out.\nIn those moments, we feel failure weigh heavy on our shoulders. I carried that grief home with me. I tried to distance myself from it as I turned on the hot water in the shower.\nI poured myself an oversize glass of wine, eager to attempt to numb and push it down. This tactic never works, and I quickly felt burning in my jaw and tightness in my chest. I gave in to the grief as the tears came in big, ugly sobs.\nI work primarily with patients who served in the military. At this point, Covid-19 has killed more Americans than World War I.\nA large portion of my patients are people of color with comorbidities that make them especially vulnerable. Cases are quickly rising. Forty percent of the rapid Covid tests I ordered in my last shift were positive, which is the most Ive had in a single day so far.\nThe other day I was reviewing the medical record of a patient and noticed the last in-person provider note was written just a few months ago by a colleague who recently succumbed to Covid-19.\nUnderstandably, patients and health care workers are pretty stressed out right now. We wear masks, social distance and sanitize surfaces, but beyond that, Im trying to become intentional about taking a step back.\nI try to make my patients laugh. They say, A merry heart does good like a medicine.\nI encourage my patients to quit smoking and eat more plant-based foods. A patient once replied to a mention of mangoes, saying, Thats a candy, right? That sparked a short jovial conversation which made him smile behind his mask.\nSometimes Ill explicitly say, Your life matters. All I can do is encourage you to make good decisions for that life.\nAndrea Morales for The New York Times\nIn the beginning, we were slammed with patients and not enough resources for patient care, just like New York. Our unit was overflowing and the idea of using another department as an overflow area was discussed. Lately, it seems that we are heading that way once again.\nRegardless of what someones belief is about the pandemic, it is here and very real. Smaller cities or towns are not exempt.\nSadly, it seems a loved one has to contract the virus for people to really understand how real and deadly this pandemic is.\nI was caring for a patient recently who came in with a fever and difficulty breathing. Once he received routine breathing treatments and steroid medications, things were much better.\nI came back to work the next day and the patient was on the ventilator with his oxygen levels low and dropping. The next couple of days his oxygen saturation was low with mucous constantly plugging his airway.\nSadly, he expired.\nIts been exhausting. The days have been longer and the volume of patients has increased.\nBeing a new mom again, I make sure that I remain safe and that I dont bring this virus home to my family. Im always wearing my P.P.E. When I clock out, I change out of my scrubs as an extra way to remain safe.\nThrough it all, I have still been able to find ways to smile and connect with my patients. I was taking care of a Covid-positive patient, and he thanked me over and over again for the service I was doing.\nIt feels good to know that youre appreciated during these tough times. A simple thank you goes such a long way.\nKevin D. Liles for The New York Times\nWhen I shook her hand and introduced myself, my patient nearly cried. No one had wanted to touch her.\nShe was one of our first Covid-19 cases. She was also a schoolteacher.\nFor the first 10 days, I volunteered to be the sole hospital medicine physician caring for our Covid patients because we had so few and it made sense to limit the points of contact.\nIn those early days, I cared for two barbers, two pastors, an elementary school teacher, a high school teacher  a cross-section of our community. It really brought home that this disease affects anyone and everyone.\nAs health professionals, were trained to live a not entirely normal life. We expect to spend stretches of time away from our families. But I never thought Id be in a situation like this.\nThose first 10 days when I was caring for our Covid patients, I was on autopilot. I didnt have time to think about the magnitude of the situation.\nOn the 11th day, I cried. I realized I might not get to go home to Lebanon for a long time, to see my family.\nEnsuring our front-line staff had an opportunity to express their turbulent emotions became a main focus of mine. I have tried to make sure I was there for my colleagues and teammates as they attempted to make sense of what was happening. Oftentimes we couldnt. We would sit in silence, vent or just cry together.\nHilary Swift for The New York Times\nIn the spring, I felt I needed to go where they were really struggling. New York was heavy on my heart. My husband was scared, but we prayed about it and prayed about it. We have six kids. Easter Sunday, something just happened. My husband was like, If you feel led to go, were going to support you on this.\nIve always felt a calling to take care of people. But this was on such a bigger level. It was a chance to be a part of history, and I wanted to set a good example for my kids of how you behave in times of need. You dont run away. You offer your help. I also felt like this would be my opportunity to make a bit of money to go to nurse practitioner school. Thats ultimately what I want to do.\nI was in New York for 33 days, and worked 26 days straight. I was home for three weeks, then I went to Texas and served 22 days in a Covid I.C.U. I was at a hospital about 5.5 miles from the border.\nIt was the worst thing Ive experienced in nursing. It hit hard and it hit fast and they werent ready. The first week, in my section of the Covid I.C.U., we lost every patient but one. The critical patients I was working on were 55 and younger, some even in their 30s. Im 34. Many were first-generation Americans or immigrants who were uninsured and had mismanaged health problems. To say the least, it was absolutely heartbreaking.\nI flew home to Florida on Monday. I needed a mental, physical, spiritual, emotional vacation from this. But then I got a call for right here in Florida. I went to my husband and said my heart was torn. How can I have given myself to New York and Texas and not do it here?\nAs of yesterday, Im working as a FEMA crisis nurse at a hospital in Clearwater. In the next couple weeks, I start school to be a nurse practitioner. Then Ill only work three days a week.\nThe silver lining in all this is that my kids and my husband have become my heroes. I thought that we would sit around a table years from now and the kids would look at me like the hero. But Im realizing that they are the heroes.\nIve seen what we all call Covid land from varying perspectives. I spent nearly three months in New York at Elmhurst. Now, Im here in South Texas.\nWe have been overwhelmed here in McAllen. Patients will sit in the emergency department holding for days before they are able to come to the I.C.U. because we are so slammed.\nIf a patient codes, we will resuscitate them where they are with the resources we have.\nIts such a quick turnaround for patients that are in the I.C.U., to passing away and to putting a new patient in their place.\nBy my 18th day, there had been more than 20 code blues and deaths. The morgue has been overrun with patients who have passed.\nIve been in more codes in a day than some people have in their careers. Simultaneous codes happening is often the norm. Ive walked off the unit to debrief, ripped my mask off and let the tears stream down my face.\nIn Queens, I held phones while families FaceTimed loved ones who they couldnt be with as they drew their last breath. Ive read the lips of my patient with a tracheostomy saying, I walked into the hospital, now I cant feel my legs.\nThese are things Ill never forget.\nIve spent time during my nursing career in the Air Force. Ive even taken mass casualty training. But there is nothing that can prepare you for this.\nI fall asleep at night sometimes still hearing alarms.\nOur Covid-19 section of the E.R. was almost empty due to the shutdown. Of course, as anticipated, all of that changed drastically and it has come back stronger than ever.\nPatient after patient, all shift long: fever, cough, weakness, shortness of breath, hypoxia and multifocal pneumonia on chest imaging.\nI find it quite disheartening. The sound of that horrible dry cough is forever burned into my memory.\nAt times, I still wonder how we will ever get through this whole mess.\nPeople are so resilient and powerful. I believe that if we could just unify our country as one, with focus from the top down on getting through this pandemic, we would be so much more successful.\nBut what has happened is the complete opposite. Division has separated our country and allowed this virus to cause so much more damage.\nWhen I have a moment to step back, it is unfathomable.\nI work in the Four Corners area and in the Navajo Nation. I transport critically ill patients with Covid-19 by helicopter or airplane from rural areas to bigger cities with properly equipped hospitals to care for them.\nIn these communities, most households are multigenerational, with multiple families under one roof. My team transports one patient at a time, but we have transported entire families by going back and forth.\nSeeing whole families being torn apart from the virus is heartbreaking and can take a toll on everyone mentally and physically.\nI had an elderly man with low oxygen levels in his blood due to Covid-19. He was able to speak but too weak to get up and move. He was going to the same hospital where his wife was. She also had Covid-19, was critically ill and had been transferred by another flight team.\nOn the morning of his transfer, the elderly man was also informed that his son, who was in his mid-20s, had died from Covid-19 complications. His son had three kids who were also being cared for by the elderly man and his wife, but now they had no one to look after them.\nI have had several co-workers fall ill from the virus as well. Being in a small aircraft for multiple hours with a patient increases your exposure. Our crews were overwhelmed with the volume of patients and transfers. The intensity is increased by having proper P.P.E. on top of a full flight suit, with 100-degree heat at 6,000 feet altitude.\nSometimes it feels like it will slow down but then a new surge will hit, and we are overwhelmed again.\nVeasey Conway for The New York Times\nI feel a little guilty that I took time off, that I went to see my parents. But the reality is, Im single. I live alone. I have been isolated in ways I didnt know were possible since this all started. And we really needed to see each other.\nWhen I left work on that last day before my vacation, the Covid I.C.U. was completely full and they were putting Covid patients elsewhere in the hospital. I.C.U. nurses were staffing those beds.\nI had a futile hope that when I came back from vacation today, the numbers would be better, but its still the same: completely full.\nI didnt know the Covid I.C.U. nurses until I started volunteering with them. They are courageous people. They did not ask to become the designated I.C.U. It was assigned to them and they have risen to the challenge. But the last time I walked over to say hello, they all looked like they had been run over by a truck. They are exhausted.\nIn early May, it was easier for me to be optimistic, even in the midst of all the devastation, because there was a hope that this would pass quickly. Normal felt as if it were around the corner.\nWork feels heavier now. Thats the only way I can describe it. It feels like you are walking through Jell-O.\nHow long can we keep this up? When will we reach the breaking point? Because its coming.\nI served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and now I serve my community during this global war against Covid-19.\nIm a nurse from a small community where many didnt believe Covid-19 was real. Many still dont. Many have continued gathering in groups without wearing masks. They believe that they are untouchable by such a horror until that horror strikes them or someone they love.\nWe have had such a significant surge in cases that many call Arizona the new New York.\nWhen there is patient after patient and no more staff or anywhere else to send them, we absorb them. Many also need more intense nursing care, making our already difficult patient load more difficult.\nWe try to keep a positive mind-set. Many colleagues have decided to step away from direct patient care, either to find a new job or to take a step back from nursing, either for health reasons, stress, safety concerns or a storm of all three. That is heartbreaking to see.\nThe weight of caring for people with Covid-19, who can quickly take a turn for the worst, leaves one feeling anxious and defeated at times. Some days I leave work in tears because its just too much physically, emotionally and mentally.\nAs nurses we give all of ourselves, comforting through the sadness, reassuring through the anxiety, educating and, most of all, being present for our patients to let them know they are not alone. We are there fighting alongside them.\nI am the only Hispanic nurse on the unit that speaks Spanish. A patient was so red and she could not breathe. She was terrified that no one spoke her language.\nBecause of the patient-provider ratios and the language barrier, this patient was neglected, fighting on her own to stay afloat until I rushed into the room. She was started on a high-flow machine to help her breathe. She was not afraid anymore and she did not feel alone.\nThe next day, the nurse taking care of her told me that the I.C.U. needed that high-flow machine for their own patient.\nHow do you tell your patient that we have to take away the machine that is helping her without knowing if we will get another one? How is another life worth more?\nShe grabbed onto her nasal tube and said, No, No, No! Yo lo necesito tambien! I need it too!\nI still check up on her. She is so wonderful and feels thankful to live, but I think about that experience every day.\nMost people on my floor will say I have grown since March. I have been a shoulder to cry on and a person that listens. I have pushed myself beyond my comfort zone to be there for my co-workers, to give hope and positivity.\nTamir Kalifa for The New York Times\nWe dont feel like heroes. We feel tired. We feel anxious. We feel the weight of our patients and families upon us.\nAside from being a nurse, I am also a DACA recipient.\nI was taking care of two Spanish-speaking patients who were both on breathing machines and unable to talk. The nurse before me said the patients were anxious all day. I was expecting to have a pretty rough night, but as I stepped into the room and spoke to them in Spanish, they nodded calmly. I realized that they were just scared and needed to hear a familiar language.\nI called one of their families to give an update and my patients daughter answered. She sounded young. I could hear her mother telling her what to ask in Spanish. The daughter began translating everything and in that moment my heart was so warm.\nI remember having to translate everything for my parents. I hated it, and my sister and I would play rock, paper, scissors to see who would have to do it. As an adult, though, it holds such a special place in my heart knowing how much I would help them.\nI speak Spanish, I quickly said. I can talk to your mom if she has any questions.\nToward the end of the call, I could hear the mom in the background say, Dile gracias, muchas gracias. Her voice was breaking.\nI was at my parents house when I learned about the Supreme Courts decision about DACA. I had been constantly refreshing my screen. Im about to start a doctorate program and in a way, the decision would determine what my future would look like.\nOnce I saw the verdict, I jumped for joy and hugged my parents. I thanked them for all of their sacrifices and enjoyed the moment.\nCode Blue! His heart stopped! A man with Covid-19, who had just presented to the E.R., was now in cardiac arrest. I jumped to action, forgetting to don my own personal protective equipment.\nChest compressions. Check heart activity. Check pulses. Epi push. Deliver shock. After a sweltering 45 minutes, we were finally able to stabilize the patient.\nI walked away with my head up feeling a sense of pride. I imagine that this is what it would feel like if I were a superhero.\nThen I hear, Oh, that guy was 80 years old. I am surprised he didnt just kick the bucket, as if an 80-year-old man deserved less effort and care for his life to be saved.\nThe patient was still fighting for his life 24 hours later. It was a poor prognosis.\nAnd that comment continued to bother me greatly. I wondered why.\nWas it because the patient was a Black man and the comment came from my white colleague?\nWas it because I have an 83-year-old grandmother who is full of life and love yet is most susceptible to this pandemic?\nWas it because I am currently watching my grandmother mourn her sister who lost her battle with Covid-19 recently?\nIt was all of it.\nTamir Kalifa for The New York Times\nI graduated nursing school just last year. I was out of training maybe three months before Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic. Its still shaping me as a nurse.\nI had a Covid patient who was younger than me and barely made it out of the I.C.U. alive. That really hit me hard. He was in the I.C.U. for months. Our entire staff followed his slow progression to health. Thankfully, he made it out but seeing the young patients  thats whats intense.\nToo many people think its fake. Well, its not. I had it. Ive seen it. I look it dead in the face every day. Every patient who has to leave in a body bag shows us that this could cost us our lives if we dont take it seriously.\nThe problem is not everyone sees it firsthand. If they saw how were running out of beds, supplies and medications, theyd think twice about taking a chance. I worry about the at-risk members of my family. If they happen to get sick, will the hospital theyre at be equipped to care for them adequately?\nI feel unappreciated and unseen by both my government and my community.\nLiving in the South and being a Black nurse just adds on another layer of stress and debilitation during this entire situation. I feel safer in my scrubs than I do in my everyday street clothes.\nBut now with the racial tension, I feel that even as a nurse, I am seen as one of them or a rioter, regardless of my attire.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated Ms. Ruizs title.\nOur state was completely locked down a few months ago. Now, people can eat in restaurants again and pretty much function like normal.\nAt the same time, our numbers of Covid-19 patients have grown exponentially. We have run out of beds in our I.C.U.s and we have had to open up additional units to treat our Covid patients, even placing them in our childrens hospital.\nIn May, the whole world seemed to be supporting us and sending lots of love and good wishes. Now, the sacrifices have gotten greater. The challenges we face are more difficult. Our patient loads are larger, often meeting or exceeding the maximum number of patients we are each allowed because staffing is so low.\nWhile Covid-19 numbers are declining in many places, ours are skyrocketing. If there was ever a time that we needed to feel supported, its now.\nEve Edelheit for The New York Times\nLately, we have been seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases here in Florida. It has been a very physically and mentally taxing last couple of weeks, to say the least.\nWhen I am tired and feeling a bit at a loss in the midst of it all, I remember a patient with a considerable degree of shortness of breath telling me, Doc, just do whatever it takes to save my life.\nWhat struck me most were not the words uttered but the look of despair written all over his face. That image will forever stay with me.\nAt the end of the day, I will never see myself as a hero. I am just trying to do my job as best as I can for those in need in these trying and uncertain times.\nI could not have ever imagined that pursuing my passion would have led me into the midst of a pandemic.\nEvery day, my wife says a word of prayer before I head off to work. She always ends it by saying, And may no weapon formed against him prosper. This helps calm my fear of contracting the virus or, even worse, unknowingly transmitting it to my family.\nThe other day, a child approached me in my clinic and held out her arms to give me a hug. As she embraced me, I had to gently and carefully push her back, redirecting her back to her mom. It felt horrible, foreign, wrong.\nI have had conversations with colleagues about writing letters to our own children, getting wills in order and promising to not let each other die alone in the I.C.U. if we contract Covid-19. This may seem dark and extreme, but these are the intense emotions that have waxed and waned over the past several months.\nCovid entered my home. My husband, who has been working full-time from home while taking care of our toddler and has left our house approximately two times since this pandemic started, became infected recently.\nHe had mild illness, but his diagnosis terrified me. I sobbed the entire first day we knew. I had seen what can happen when Covid takes over, even in young and healthy people.\nOur son and I tested negative. Thankfully, my husbands illness remained mild as he quarantined in our guest bedroom for 11 days with no physical contact with us. However, even with mild illness, it is clear that his recovery back to normal will be one that is long and slow.\nThere has been a surge in the number of patients that we are seeing here in Miami. The nurses are overwhelmed, the doctors are overwhelmed, and resources are limited. Life has changed significantly.\nI was one of the first nurses at my hospital to care for a Covid patient. It was the very beginning and, despite the uncertainties and fear I felt then, that was a piece of cake compared to when the numbers started to increase and patients began to get sicker and die.\nIve seen fevers that Tylenol couldnt break. Patients are dying every day, sometimes two or three in one day.\nI dress up every time I enter a patients room, whether to turn off a beeping IV pump or for a code blue. Doing this along with wearing an N95 mask for 12 hours at a time, which causes the skin on ones nose to break down, has made things difficult.\nI have a young son. Hes has been asking to see his friends and expresses the desire to go back to school. He wants to go on the playground, and I have to tell him no.\nI feel helpless and scared of the long-term effects this could have on his emotional and cognitive growth.\nAllison V. Smith for The New York Times\nWorking in the Covid I.C.U., where patients are proned, sedated, ventilated and paralyzed with no families allowed to visit, means nurses are everything to the patients. I update families and set up Zoom calls.\nI hear and see the sadness when their loved ones take the last breath. I hear and see the happiness when a patient gets extubated and can finally breathe on their own.\nWe have to wear P.P.E. for 12 hours or more and dont get to complain if we are sweating too much during a code or if the supplies are not what we were used to.\nIt is sad going through so much to see a successful patient outcome and then see people refuse to practice social distancing or wear a mask. Ive had a few arguments with people who believe in conspiracy theories or that Covid-19 isnt real. It is real to all of us fighting to keep patients alive just about every day of the week.\nI have felt some hope, too. When a patient I had worked with for a long time was finally able to mouth words and say my name, Courtney, I felt courageous and so proud of the team I work with.\nWe were not prepared for the second surge that has brought Texas to its knees. Our hospitals I.C.U. is almost at capacity and we have converted many of the regular floors into Covid wards to create a barrier.\nWe are beginning to cancel all elective procedures once again. We had done that during the first surge and were just returning to normalcy.\nMany of our nursing staff tested positive for Covid-19 and had to be quarantined, increasing the mental and financial burden on our employees and their families.\nMy wife is a physician as well. We have been challenged with working out shifts to babysit, especially as our nanny fell sick with Covid-19 and had to go on an extended leave.\nI lost two of my beloved and longtime patients to Covid-19. It was utterly heart-wrenching.\nI remember bragging to my elderly parents that I felt Tucson had been spared from the virus since we had relatively low numbers in the beginning of May.\nThen our governor reopened the state too soon. Young people flocked to the bars in Phoenix and went rafting in big groups on the Salt River. Temperatures climbed above 100 degrees and people went indoors more. Then our numbers spiked.\nI think people are finally starting to understand the gravity of this virus. Tensions are high. Everyone is angry. Angry if they cant get tested. Angry if the results take too long.\nOur urgent care became a testing site for symptomatic Covid patients as well as for asymptomatic essential workers. I have been averaging about 50 patients in a 13-hour shift for the last few weeks.\nWe still have nonbelievers who try to come into our urgent care, but we kick them out if they refuse to wear a mask.\nIt only takes one personal connection to really hit home. My 22-year-old niece from Indiana was in the hospital in March with Covid-19. She had an oral temperature of 106 degrees and was on oxygen. She was all alone. My sister-in-law would FaceTime her for hours just to keep her company. It was terrifying.\nAndrea Morales for The New York Times\nThe first time I placed a patient with Covid-19 into the I.C.U. on life support, I pondered what would become of humanity. He lay in the hospital bed, struggling for every breath, battling the good fight.\nWas what I was witnessing in that moment a glimpse of more to come  a singular event of humanity dying en masse?\nDo not be afraid, I told him. We will not leave your side. We just need to place a tube to help your lungs breathe better. We will see you when you wake up.\nI lied the good lie. Without hope, what is the purpose of life?\nOur twice-a-day prayer over the hospital intercom broadcasts hourly now. For those of whatever faith and those who claim no faith, we all want to believe. We all want to believe that we will pull through this, if not individually then as a whole.\nI broke my promise to my patient in the I.C.U. Should I not have promised something that is beyond what I can deliver?\nIn that last moment of wakefulness, he believed in hope in the midst of despair.\nHe passed peacefully in his sleep.\nBrandon Thibodeaux for The New York Times\nWe are getting flooded with patients coming in that are very sick to the point where we are having to divert them because we are running out of beds and space.\nIt is so bad that we are holding patients in the E.R. for days because we have no rooms available on the inpatient floors.\nIf we feel the patients are simply too critical, we try to transfer them to another hospital. Unfortunately, many of the hospitals in Houston are also experiencing similar volume surges.\nI am emotionally exhausted and physically drained. I have been doing this since the pandemic started.\nI still fear bringing things home to my child and family. I limit my contact with them but its so difficult because I miss them dearly.\nWhen I am able to see them, I social distance and wear a mask just to be safe. Behind the mask, I hold back tears and wonder if it will ever end or if this is just our new normal.\nI remember the moment we were told we would become a dedicated Covid unit. After that meeting, I snapped a selfie to document that moment. When I look back on that image, I can see the fear, the panic and the anxiety in my eyes.\nWe were in the dark. We were learning as we went.\nIt seemed like every shift we were changing something. It was terrifying because we just didnt have answers.\nNumbers in our area have been steadily increasing.\nI would be lying if I said most days didnt feel daunting and full of anxiety, but it is my calling. I have known my entire life that I wanted to be a nurse. I wanted to be there, helping someone else when they needed it most.\nThis journey has made me a stronger nurse.\nThis was my first rotation ever as a doctor, so it was kind of interesting to start practicing during the pandemic. I hadnt learned anything about Covid-19. We didnt go back to school from March onward.\nEverything is really high stakes right now. We are getting several patients a day. I think well be at max capacity pretty soon. Were surprised we are not there now with the volume that we have. Some of the surrounding hospitals arent accepting transfers because they are at max capacity, and we are pretty close to it.\nIve seen a lot of sick people. People are getting better, too, but there are sick ones that dont get better. The first patient I ever had, one of the seniors ended up taking him, and he didnt make it. He passed away in a week.\nInitially, a lot of people here thought that young people werent getting it. But we had a 30-year-old who was really sick in the I.C.U. Its like if its not happening to them and their immediate circle, then it doesnt exist. I went to Target the other day and nobody had a mask on. I saw a bunch of people at a bar because it was Bike Week here, and I was like, You guys dont understand whats really happening. I know people are still going to the beach. Its pretty frustrating.\nPeople are coming in sick every day, but something as simple as wearing a mask could probably save a life. People just dont seem to care.\nKevin D. Liles for The New York Times\nIt was the earliest days of the pandemic, when it still felt weird that the streets and parking lots were empty, but our hospitals were quite full. He was my first Covid-19 patient, and we had no idea what to expect.\nFor an I.C.U. doctor, Im usually pretty optimistic, but if Im being completely honest, for just half a second, as I prepared to enter his room that first time, I thought, Something bad is going to happen.\nFor me, connecting with my patients is essential. I need to see them as people. But there were all these barriers between us: the mask, the curtain and the limitation on how many times I could go into his room. Everything felt different.\nHis smile became my bright spot, though. Through all the scary unknowns, this man never assumed the role of being sick.\nHe would tell us, Im feeling much better today, even though science was telling us that his condition hadnt changed.\nMedicine is partly science, partly art. You usually have some sense of where you are heading. But not with Covid-19. Nothing seems to be guaranteed. It works against logic sometimes  a patient can show signs of recovery and rapidly decline hours later.\nThe day we released him, I was ecstatic. Scientifically, I cant quantify the connection between mind, body and optimism. But I will tell you this, I believe its what kept him going.\nI believe its what keeps all of us going.\nI work in a medium-size hospital. Our morgue is built to hold just two bodies. The other night, I helped transport three deceased patients to our morgue, which already had five bodies awaiting funeral home arrangements.\nWere breaking our backs to keep our heads above water.\nWe now have seven Covid-19 units and a designated holding area in the E.R. where patients might be waiting up to a week for a bed upstairs. Our free-standing emergency rooms have set up tents and trucks equipped with oxygen for patients awaiting beds.\nTheres an unspoken understanding thats basically, A patient gets a room when someone else dies.\nWe have several rooms with two patients together and little to no privacy. Many patients are awake and alert. If one patient codes, we cant protect the roommate from seeing everything. Its common procedure for us but must be a nightmare for them.\nYesterday, my unit ran seven codes over two shifts. All of those patients died. Their ages ranged from 21 to 66.\nRecently, one patient was so traumatized by witnessing an unsuccessful resuscitation attempt that his body seemed to stop fighting. He passed a few days later.\nA husband and wife recently passed together. As sad as it sounds, we were grateful they could be near each other. Everyone else dies away from their loved ones.\nOne patient lost her father who was in a room across the hall from hers. She wasnt able to see him.\nIts been difficult for me to come to terms with the fact that I have absolutely no control over who recovers and who dies. I worry about my patients constantly, which takes its toll. Theres a Kevin Devine song I listen to every day now on the drive to work that ends with, Dont kill yourself to raise the dead. Youll only end up joining them. This is the mind-set Ive adopted to help me not break down.\nSarahs brother, Joe Berger, worked on the front lines in Chicago. They come from a family of medical workers.\nIn the beginning, we were seeing more elderly patients with comorbidities. Now we have younger people. They havent been social distancing.\nThey seem to bounce back better. Part of that is age, part of it is that we understand more.\nNow we see which medications are effective or have too many side effects. We have a better understanding of what doesnt work. For example, in the beginning everyone got hooked into a ventilator, but now we know not everyone has to be hooked into one right away.\nOur colleagues from Italy warned us upfront about clots. We are being proactive in providing blood thinners to prevent them.\nWe need to have more experience on the long-term disabilities. There are patients who develop severe inflammation and their muscles are deteriorating in a matter of days. Recuperating takes rehab and good nutrition. If you dont do that early, there is a good possibility you will not regain muscle. I am concerned that after you have inflammation in your lungs, you will have a scar. The lungs dont regenerate. Our hope is that medications will prevent long-term scarring, but we dont have enough information. Its too early.\nSaul Martinez for The New York Times\nThings are horribly worse compared to the first surge back in March.\nCovid-19 cases are through the roof. My Covid I.C.U. has reached capacity at 20 beds. Hospital administrators opened up two overflow units that each hold 10 beds.\nWe are running low on drugs and oxygen. Nurses are overworked and underpaid. We are still not receiving any hazard pay for our efforts. We are extremely short-staffed with very critical patients. We feel unappreciated by our superiors.\nI was one patients biggest advocate. I gave it my all to provide him the best care every day. There were days he seemed better, and then days he took three steps back. I knew deep down in my heart he was not going to make it. I felt defeated and even angry.\nIt had been over a month since his family had seen him. They deserved to see and speak to him in his final moments. As I FaceTimed his family, I watched them cry, and my heart shattered. I tried my hardest to hold it together but failed. We cried together over the phone as they expressed their love and said their goodbyes.\nI went home that night and realized that I do not want to waste my life chasing money or love. I prefer to count the blessings God has gifted me. I am in good health and have the ability to care for those who cannot care for themselves.\nIve taken care of hundreds of Covid patients. Some have been super sick. Some, not so much. Sadly, a lot of the older ones have died.\nWe have definitely seen an uptick in cases recently.\nI cared for a 22-year-old female patient yesterday, who came in after having Covid-type symptoms for two weeks. She admitted to cough, fevers, runny nose, muscle aches  typical stuff.\nI asked what was different today that made her go to the E.R. She told me that her boss made her get checked out. I asked her where she worked. She told me a local fast-food restaurant.\nThis woman had been serving food to people for two weeks despite these symptoms!\nShe got tested and was positive. She was advised to avoid work and stay home, but there is no way to enforce or regulate that.\nWhen people wonder why we cant keep this under control, this is the reason.\nBefore Covid-19 arrived in my hometown on the Navajo Nation, I was working as a family doctor, treating patients of all ages. I worked in the hospital that I was born in and alongside doctors who took care of me and my relatives over the years. My patients were happy to see a Navajo doctor who looked like them and understood their culture and language.\nThen many across the Navajo Nation attended a church rally that became the Covid-19 superspreader event. We were a hidden hot zone.\nMany families here live in multigenerational households, have poor access to health facilities, no transportation, and many homes lack running water or electricity. We suspected this had much to do with our high rates.\nMy duties were quickly shifted to assist in the triage stations and emergency room.\nI saw familiar names among the list of positive tests and saw familiar faces in the E.R.\nI heard devastating stories from families who had multiple relatives fall ill and as many as three subsequent deaths.\nI saw my own relatives names on those lists. I saw their faces in the hallways and the emergency room.\nI am saddened to see patients fall prisoner to their own anxiety and depression, to see many lose what little income they had to feed their grandchildren and pay their bills.\nBut our early response has been effective. We have seen our curve flatten, and we watch the ongoing rise in the rest of Arizona.\nTheres an urgent call to reach back to traditional teachings of balance and harmony, a concept known as hozh. We collectively believe in our own resilience. The history of our survival is proof to us that our people will still come out strong.\nTamir Kalifa for The New York Times\nMy co-workers and I have been hit or grabbed by patients while swabbing them for Covid. It hurts when the swab goes in, but we have to do it right so we can get accurate results. I have been threatened by patients after swabbing them.\nPeople have thrown their masks on the floor at my feet. They refuse to wear the mask correctly.\nWe are seeing people coming in for anything from toe pain to a mild headache who have the Covid-19 indicators, such as low oxygen levels or high fevers. Even when those indicators are not there, many people test positive when they get swabbed prior to surgery or when theyre admitted to the hospital for other reasons.\nThe thing that sticks with me the most is seeing people without their families. Ive seen little old ladies sick in the hospital who cant have their husbands of 60 years at their bedside to comfort them and hold their hands. So I try to take some extra time to do that for them.\nAllison V. Smith for The New York Times\nIn Texas, people were ordered to stay at home for several weeks in April and May. The number of patients in our coronavirus I.C.U. seemed to plateau. Then, things evolved.\nWe have opened up several floors of the hospital as dedicated coronavirus units. They have exploded with four times the number of Covid patients. Our hospital had to rent five continuous dialysis machines used to filter the blood of the sickest I.C.U. patients. Were still running low on high-flow oxygen machines.\nIts all hands on deck. If I have time, I like to clean any visible spots on the floor. While this is typically the job of an environmental service colleague, they are normally even busier than we are.\nWe prioritize video chats and allow families to grieve as much or as little as they need. They remind me that this statistic is a human who at some point had a first kiss, learned to drive, loved a child. I wont ever forget hearing the sobs of these loved ones through a computer monitor.\nPost-mortem care can take anywhere from one hour to four. Several shifts ago, I spent more time caring for the dead than the living. That was new.\nSome members of a community group crocheted tiny squares of yarn to remind patients that they are being prayed for. Ive seen several nurses place one of these crocheted prayers in the body bag before zipping it shut.\nAround the World\nNurses, doctors and other health care workers reflect on fighting the coronavirus.\nUpdated August 1, 2020\nGianni Cipriano for The New York Times\nAfter so many months spent fighting this invisible war, my colleagues and I are tired. We are holding on because the fear of a new wave of infections is always high. People here have started living as if nothing has happened, but in my hospital we are ready.\nMy fear is having to isolate myself again from my family. I have two children, ages 4 and 2, and the thought of having to move away from them again for who knows how long makes me feel very bad. But my job is to help people, and thats what Ill do.\nIt takes time to prepare for any intubation but even longer for a Covid-19 patient because of all the P.P.E.\nAs I was getting ready, the patient went into cardiac arrest.\nThe patient was in one of our emergency departments smallest rooms. The only light in the room was a single dull ceiling light.\nI was unbelievably hot and dripping in sweat. My face shield fogged up immediately and I could barely see as I began to intubate the patient.\nIt didnt help that the patient was being rocked continuously as my colleagues did chest compressions to keep him alive.\nNurses and technicians rambled in and out of the patients room.\nKeep the door closed! I yelled. I want only essential members of the team in the room because this is a very high-risk procedure!\nMy colleagues couldnt hear what I was saying through my P.P.E. It was a disaster.\nI successfully intubated the patient and his heart started beating again. Unfortunately, he died later that night while up in the I.C.U.\nChloe Collyer for The New York Times\nWe say that racism is a disease, because it is the underlying ideology that leads to the chronic illness that we see within our communities.\nGeorge Floyd survived illness with Covid-19 just to die in the hands of police. So even in the midst of a pandemic, I as a physician am treating the diseases faced by Black Americans with my activism. And I had 10,000 colleagues who agreed, 100 percent wearing masks, so we can continue to protect ourselves and our patients.\nBreonna Taylor hit home for me because she was a young Black woman who was an E.M.T. It felt personal. And then to have that followed up with what happened with George Floyd, I was paralyzed. I sat for a while trying to understand what could be done. Like many people, I felt like I cant just sit still and do nothing.\nAs a medical community, we have a very powerful voice and we carry a lot of power and privilege within our profession to say that this needs to be looked at.\nWe cannot separate the disparities around police violence and racism and the impact on mortality among Black Americans in the same way that we cannot separate disparities of chronic illness in the Black community and underlying hypertension, diabetes and heart disease and its impact on mortality of Black Americans with Covid-19.\nMeghan Dhaliwal for The New York Times\nI was in bed 213 of the intensive care area and he was right in front of me, in bed 210. I would ask my colleagues about his progress.\nIts not looking good, they would say.\nOne afternoon, I noticed his bed was empty. I started crying. I wanted to help him so badly, but I couldnt do anything. I was fighting for my own life. Edgar was a nurse, just like me. We had worked together for years. He was my friend. He was always smiling.\nI spent 12 days in the I.C.U., and during this time, seven other health workers died. Only three of us made it. I dont understand why so many of us are just slipping away.\nI had tried really hard not to get infected. I even bought a snorkeling mask, which I adapted with a ventilator filter for protection. At first, I thought it was exhaustion from working two shifts where I basically went 36 hours without sleep.\nLying in my hospital bed, I kept thinking about all the patients I had treated just days before. I remembered the looks they had given me: eyes of sorrow, pleading, anguish. I thought to myself, I must have the same look on my face right now. But my eyes carried a double fear. I was fully aware of what the virus was doing to my body and how likely it was that I was going to die. At one point, the pain, the vomit, the horrible headache, I couldnt take it anymore. I wanted to throw in the towel.\nMiraculously, soon after, I started getting better.I am now back at work. I am still afraid, but I wanted to go back and help out, just like they helped me.\nThe hardest thing for me during these Covid times has been seeing patients die without the presence of family.\nHaving to call or FaceTime a patients family is tough. It is hard to explain and I can only imagine how hard it is for them to try to understand and get closure when they cant be there by the side of their loved ones.\nI volunteered to work in an I.C.U. ward when our hospital was getting inundated by Covid patients. The crisis has made me appreciate how interconnected specialties are within the medical field, how much we depend on our nursing staff, respiratory technicians and janitorial staff to keep these extremely ill patients alive, and how lucky we are to work in a well-staffed hospital.\nCovid admissions have definitely slowed down. I am back to taking care of patients with heart disease and heart attacks, but we are bracing ourselves for a second wave in the fall.\nOn a personal level, I was planning on getting married this month but due to Covid we have had to postpone it to next June. Were hoping that a vaccine will be available by then!\nAlessandro Falco for The New York Times\nAt first, it was like we did not really have the virus, only light symptoms: fever and cough, loss of smell. But then on April 17, a member of the Tuyuka ethnic group called me, worried for a woman who had been lying in the hammock for more than seven days with a fever, cough, chest pain and difficulty breathing.\nIn that moment, I understood that the virus had arrived in our community.\nI had 10 patients with severe breathing difficulties. They were transferred to the hospital. But many in our community have been afraid to go there.\nThey will kill me in the hospital, said one man who had severe symptoms for 15 days. He was very afraid of what he saw on the news, that the people who went to the hospital did not return. He preferred to die at home. I persuaded him to go to the hospital. He spent 21 days there and is better now.\nIn our Indigenous communities, health conditions are precarious. We had no money to buy medicines, so I asked friends and professors for help. I didnt have any kind of protective gear, so I used a cloth mask until people saw my working conditions and gave me material to protect me.\nOur families mostly live on crafts and informal jobs, domestic workers or bricklayer assistants. Our first problem, a week after the lockdown decree, was food. So I started a campaign on social networks to collect food donations.\nWe started producing informative videos. We were advising to practice hand hygiene, but they didnt have water. The health issue goes into the background when the priority is to be able to drink. This hit me.\nMany people want everything to go back to normal. I dont want to go back to what is normal here for Indigenous lives.\nOn Feb. 20, I was called to evaluate a 37-year-old man, healthy and athletic, with very serious pneumonia on both lungs. His blood analyses and CT scan showed that he probably had viral pneumonia, and his condition had deteriorated quickly. The coronavirus was still a very remote idea. We were aware of it, but we all saw it as something foreign from us. We gave the patient, later known as Patient 1, the traditional pneumonia treatments, which he did not respond to. When we intubated him, his wife came to me and told me about a dinner her husband had attended, where one of the participants had recently returned from China.\nWe checked a protocol we had received in January: patients were considered at risk of coronavirus only if they had respiratory problems coming from China, or if they had been in contact with a positive patient. That was not our patients case, but we decided to swab him anyway. Thanks to that, we understood that the virus was in Europe.\nAfter his result came back positive  that same night  we hospitalized another young man who was also positive for coronavirus. The following morning, another one came. Once we knew there was one positive patient, we saw the others differently. The diagnoses became very easy.\nIn the following days, an unimaginable quantity of patients started coming in and we were literally overwhelmed.\nDr. Malara diagnosed Italys first case of the coronavirus outbreak.\nI was looking after regular inpatients at my hospital when I was dispatched to another hospital that was emptying to prepare for Covid-19 patients. Nothing was ready. We were discussing ways to prepare for patients but by noon, two patients already came in.\nSoon 50, 60 and up to 80 patients were arriving in a day. Unimaginable, no? Ambulances carrying patients were surrounding the hospital building.\nThe condition of some patients was suddenly getting worse. Family members werent allowed, even when things got bad. We nurses cried, it was breaking our hearts. I was unable to console the families as I normally would.\nWe worked about 12 to 14 hours a day. It felt very, very hard. I felt a sense of dread. I asked myself, Is this something I can handle? I felt scared, but there was no running away. It was what I had to do. My colleagues all felt the same. I feel a strong bond with them now. The sense of camaraderie is like that of a war veteran.\nI felt so bad for my family. At first, they were against me being dispatched to the hospital, but later they supported me. My daughter said, Mom, you are amazing. My friends think so, too. When I came home late one night, I cried in front of my husband and mother and said, I am grateful and I am sorry. I wouldnt have been able to hold on without their support.\nLast year, I graduated from Herat Universitys medical program. I love this job, and when the virus spread in Herat I volunteered to work at a Covid-19 treatment center. When I told my family, everyone was against me. They said that I was risking their lives, but I insisted and took the job. Now they support me. But other relatives dont want to talk to me.\nIt is my responsibility to take care of patients so they stay strong to fight the virus. I dont just take care of their physical health; they need to be supported mentally, because people think the virus is a punishment from God. We console them and tell them it is a global pandemic. It doesnt necessarily kill everyone.\nWe lost a few patients, and those were the hardest moments of my life. The patients were in front of my eyes and I couldnt do anything.\nI dont want to lose anyone else. I want to work harder. I think I am stronger and kinder than I was.\nHeather Sten for The New York Times\nOn 9/11, I was working at Morgan Stanley on the 73rd floor of the World Trade Center. It was actually my birthday. When the second plane hit my building, I felt the entire building shift and sway. I thought we were going to topple over. I thought, Im not going to survive this.\nAn event like that gives you a different perspective on life. A few years later I realized that I was meant to be a doctor and make my life count by helping others.\nNow we have another war in New York and in the world with Covid. Im an anesthesiologist, so Im intubating patients who are no longer able to breathe on their own. Im right by the patients airway, often inches away, as I place the breathing tube. With the respirator, I feel safe.\nIts my duty. Every patient I intubate who is able to survive Covid is a life that is saved.\nHilary Swift for The New York Times\nRight now Im at a hospital in the Bronx, staying at a hotel in Times Square. I actually had to quit to come here. My hospital wasnt allowing leaves and it was just something that I really wanted to do. So I weighed my options and decided that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\nIf it were my hometown or state, I would want people to come help. Weve had plenty of hurricanes in the past, and so many people have dropped everything and come to our state to help out. I just felt like I could return the favor.\nIm actually a N.I.C.U. nurse, so this is way different for me. I have big people. I know how to run a ventilator on a premature baby, but to run a ventilator on an adult, the settings are different and the drips are different. But I feel like every day I am becoming a better nurse because Im learning something new every single day that I come to work.\nThere are four of us nurses in the unit, all from different states. After the first 12 hours, we worked so well together. Was it overwhelming? Absolutely. Ive never felt this level of exhaustion before. But its so nice to have people that I can lean on and count on. Even when were not at work, well text and be like, Hey, how are you feeling, Hey, do you need anything? Can I get you anything? Its a really strong support system.\nOriginally I was here for three weeks. I chose to stay for another eight. And then well see if Im still needed. I want to be here as long as I can. I want to heal and touch every patient that I can before I have to go home to my puppy in Florida.\nMy patients are watching the news and seeing how many people are dying around the world, knowing they are positive. They ask me if they are going to die. I tell them that we are all trying our absolute best to get them back home to their loved ones.\nI chose a career in health care  specifically, critical care  because I wanted to help others in their most vulnerable and dire time of need. I put my faith in God and take precautions by properly donning, removing and disinfecting my personal protective equipment. But in the back of my mind, I cant help but wonder how much the risk of infection increases from constant exposure.\nAngela Ponce for The New York Times\nWe started off so ill-equipped for this tragedy. We are roughly 700 intensive care physicians for a country of over 32 million. Were way below international standards.\nEvery I.C.U. bed in Lima is taken. Dozens of patients are waiting to be assigned to one. We have to choose who will be saved and who wont. Its terrible.\nIve almost doubled my work shifts. Most of the week, I live either at the hospital or the clinic. Im only at home for a couple of days at a time.\nWere exhausted, but we draw strength to go on from wherever we can.\nWhen someone makes it out of the I.C.U., we feel immense joy. That patient is a survivor.\nChicago has done well in flattening the curve, but many health-care professionals around the city are concerned that we are going to have an even bigger second wave either over the summer or during the next flu season.\nThe level of stress has been sustaining at elevated levels. My elderly father has been hospitalized several times, although luckily not with Covid. It has been distressing for me to help my mother manage his condition over the phone, since it is too risky for me to come home.\nMy husband is back to work after over two months of being unemployed but it adds increased stress because I try to be available to drive him to work. We avoid as much public transport as possible  a feat that is not easy when I work night shifts and he works evenings.\nBut I am one of the lucky ones. My medical center has been well prepared, with an emergency department leadership team that is proactive. After three months, I am still Covid- and antibody-free.\nIn May, when I was in my third trimester of my second pregnancy, many people questioned why I was still working. My answer was, It is my job, and it has been an honor and a privilege to serve my community and do my part in this pandemic.\nEvery morning, I would wake and say a prayer, not only for all my patients and colleagues but for the safety of myself and my unborn child.\nI stopped seeing the critical patients as I tried to avoid exposure. However, I found that inevitably every patient is at risk for Covid-19.\nI have never been more grateful for P.P.E. I took precautions with every patient, including the case of simple back pain.\nI had to wear a mask during my own delivery, which was actually worse than wearing one on a 12-hour day in the E.R. The labor and delivery ward staff did their best to ease my worries and make my experience as normal as possible, but there were constant temperature checks for my husband and me, and we were not able to leave our room.\nThere were no visitors, and no newborn photo shoots, but at least I was able to have my husband by my side.\nNow, my newborn daughters health is my No. 1 concern.\nBryan Anselm for The New York Times\nBoth of my jobs require lots of patient contact. I am also immunocompromised with Type 1 diabetes.\nThe worst experience was taking care of a patient who suffered from Parkinsons disease and was positive for the coronavirus. He had a high fever and wasnt eating. I was trying to feed him but he just kept begging to die.\nWhether its cleaning bathrooms covered in explosive diarrhea or cleaning up the patients, I continue to show up and help.\nI work per diem and I make $15 an hour. I dont get benefits and I dont get hazard pay. I risk my safety and my familys safety because in times of chaos someone needs to remain calm and show up.\nSince the outbreak began, my responsibilities have remained the same. But the stakes are higher. The risk is greater.\nWhen life gets scary, whats the best option? Quit and hope youre safe? Or step up and help those who need it?\nFor me there is no choice.\nGianni Cipriano for The New York Times\nThe pandemic has been like war.\nIf I make a mistake, there is a high risk of unknowingly infecting my colleague, my friend, my family, my patient or a stranger.\nEverything ends. Covid-19 will too, but I will still feel responsible for them.\nI learned that teamwork is the only way to build something good. Building is always tiring, but it is the most beautiful challenge.\nWhile someone like me  a nurse  should be against protests in order to contain the virus, I also recognize the importance of being an ally, of participating in this movement, now more than ever. It is a privilege to be able to walk alongside protesters.\nOne of the most chilling experiences I had was on Breonna Taylors birthday. We marched from Washington Square Park and made a brief stop at the steps across from Penn Station. There, we sang Breonna Taylor a happy birthday.\nI carried a sign that read, I did not treat Covid patients only to then silently stand by while Black lives are murdered by police.\nI wanted people to know they could tap my skills as an I.C.U. nurse, and also that I stood with them.\nIn my backpack, I carried a myriad of medical supplies: saline flushes, xeroform, three different kinds of tape, goggles to protect against pepper spray and other items to help with immediate first aid needs.\nWhat has really mattered to me is refuting the idea that one has to choose between pandemic protective measures or protesting police brutality. I dont think those two issues are mutually exclusive.\nWhile Covid-19 is a pandemic and a public health threat, so too is police brutality.\nIm a major in the Massachusetts Army National Guard, leading mobile Covid-19 strike teams in nursing homes, mental health facilities, veterans homeless shelters and memory care centers all across the state.\nYesterday, during a shift change, a medic soldier in a Tyvek suit, drenched in sweat, came out and informed me that we had two K.I.A.s in there, sir.\nWhat? I thought. We killed someone in there?\nOf course, what he meant to say was D.O.A., or two elderly residents who had passed away before we even had the opportunity to test them for the coronavirus.\nNo more than 48 hours had passed since we were asked to swab test these 72 residents.Upon arrival, we were left with only 70.\nNothing prepares you for this. Not only is this virus deadly, it is silent, insidious and sometimes faster than our best efforts.\nI was deployed to the Covid ward as soon as the number of cases spiked in my city, Bergamo. I started doing 12-hour shifts, taking one patient after the other, wide-eyed and begging for good news. I was scared I was going to do something stupid, because lets be honest, an oncologist doesnt know much about infectious diseases.\nI was also scared I would catch the disease and bring it to my family.\nI started having symptoms and diagnosed myself with coronavirus. Four days later, my 1-year-old son came down with a fever and a cough. I started panicking: How can I take him to the hospital? What do I do if he struggles to breathe? I had all these questions but I had to stay calm. A doctor must think rationally. A few days later, my husband started showing symptoms.\nI spent the nights trying to visualize the moment during my three weeks in the Covid ward when I caught the disease. I felt guilty that I was the one who brought this virus home, I was my familys infector. My husbands conditions deteriorated and with my mind full of images I had seen at the hospital, I feared the worst. Despite my weakness and temperature, I cared for him at home, measuring his oxygen saturation and temperature. Slowly, our conditions improved.\nOn April 27, I returned to work. But I am never going to be the same doctor I was before. This situation changed us all in an irreversible way.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken all the necessary measures to keep our activities running as usual, but I cannot deny that it is challenging.\nMedical staff are at higher risk of being infected. We are working longer shifts and we are staying away from our families as much as possible to protect our loved ones.\nWhat scares me the most is that if a large increase in Covid-19 patients happens at once, Lebanons health care system is at risk of becoming completely overwhelmed, and then not everyone would get to receive proper hospitalization.\nGlenn Arcos for The New York Times\nIts easy to feel abandoned up here in the desert. I was transferred here a year ago. All of my family lives elsewhere, and the solitude can be difficult. Working in a hospital is all about teamwork and camaraderie, but this has been isolating for the staff. We even have to sit far apart in the cafeteria because if we get ill, theres nobody else.\nSpirits are low, and thats hard to see among such a great group of people. I try to find ways to lift morale.\nWhen I heard about the E.R. doctor in New York who killed herself, I was shaken. Lots of people got in touch to ask if I was OK.\nI am, but when Im on my own at home, the sadness starts to creep over me. It can be overwhelming. I cant even go out at night to take my mind off the situation because there are curfews in place and everywhere is closed.\nThe virus is the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing on my mind when I get into bed, exhausted. This is day after day after day.\nIm not the same person I was a few months ago.\nBethany Mollenkof for The New York Times\nI witness death often, and I have for more than 15 years, but I still have not watched the videos of the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery or George Floyd. I cannot bear that pain and I feel like I dont have time to fully process it in the midst of the pandemic. It has been tough for me, as a physician, as a public health professional and as a Black man.\nBoth the pandemic and the extrajudicial killings of African-Americans clearly show that Black lives are not valued.\nWorking at the hospital and volunteering at a homeless shelter, I have seen how this pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color. Access to testing has been a huge issue in our community during this pandemic. Minorities and poor people throughout the country were being turned away for testing, and consequently these populations presented with more severe symptoms. This has a snowball effect; combined with the problems of access, mistrust of the health care system by communities of color and implicit biases of health care providers, it is a recipe for disaster.\nI participated in one of the marches on Beverly Boulevard. It was an amazing experience. There were people of all ages, races and ethnicities. People were walking, biking and sitting in cars. Everyone was peaceful and the signs provided messages that the recent events were not acceptable.\nWe cannot sit idly by while Black people die at alarming rates.\nMarya Sherron, via Associated Press\nIm okay. Dont tell Mom and Dad. Theyll worry, Kious Kelly texted his sister on March 18 after telling her he had tested positive for the coronavirus.\nHer replies went unanswered. He died six days later.\nMr. Kelly, who was 48, was an assistant nurse manager at a hospital in Manhattan. He had moved to New York City more than 20 years earlier to pursue a dream of becoming a dancer, but eventually attended nursing school.\nHe was known for cheering up grumpy colleagues with chocolate and offering compassionate support to patients and their families.\nHe went above and beyond, the son of a patient once wrote of Mr. Kelly to the hospitals president.\nHis death became a rallying cry for the need for protective gear for health care workers.\nHe ran toward the oncoming enemy determined to bring survivors back with him, his sister, Marya Patrice Sherron, wrote on Facebook after his death. Thats who he was.\nThe Times previously wrote an obituary for Mr. Kelly, as well as an article about how his co-workers blamed a lack of protective gear for his death.\nLuckily the worst is over here, but we must not let our guard down. Until a few months ago, I worked in a Covid department. Now that I am no longer in that department, my desire for human contact is getting stronger. Unfortunately, you still have to be patient and keep the right distance. Despite that, I promise every day to give love to my patients. I hope that everything will return to normal soon and that we will embrace each other stronger than before.\nErin Schaff/The New York Times\nI spent three nights in a row with a 77-year-old man who was nonverbal because of a previous traumatic brain injury. He was dying, but slowly, from Covid-19. His family couldnt be with him. He was Jewish and couldnt celebrate Passover.\nI held his hand, smoothed his hair and told him his family loves him and wishes they could be with him so much.\nI told him that Im here and I smiled. He smiled back. And I held back my tears.\nI have been floated all over the hospital to different biocontainment units outside of my home department. I have oriented and taught intermediate nurses on I.C.U. care for critical patients to upskill them in case a time comes when we dont have enough I.C.U. nurses.\nEvery day, when I cross the street toward the hospital and greet the security guard in a mask, Im reminded that we are all in this together.\nI am coordinating a project run by Doctors Without Borders to tackle Covid-19 in Burkina Faso. In the capital, Ouagadougou, we have transformed a former Ebola treatment center into a 50-bed Covid-19 treatment center with intensive care services.\nDoctors and nurses must have jumpsuits, face shields and everything they need to avoid getting infected, for their own safety and to treat patients without spreading the virus. However, we have struggled to find and bring in that necessary material as global shortages hampered their purchase and travel restrictions hobbled the supply chain.\nI do my best to comfort and reassure people in my environment. For example, recently a friends relative tested positive after returning from Niger. He was afraid of being hospitalized, so they contacted me. I focused on calming him down, providing him with insights and recommendations from a medical perspective.\nThe same happened with a nurse I know. People are afraid of the disease  even health care workers need support.\nWe are dealing with the unknown, and nobody was ready for it. Many are concerned about the disease, especially with all they read on social media. Others are more worried about their own survival amid Covid-19 restrictions. Staying at home is a luxury many cannot afford.\nI live in the U.S. but I was in Ecuador on vacation when the border shut down. I have a license to practice here and decided to join the front lines.\nI was in the peak of the Covid-19 curve here, when nothing was enough  not I.C.U. beds, respirators, P.P.E., not even body bags.\nBody storage was something out of an unthinkable horror movie. People couldnt find their loved ones in a sea of decomposing bodies at the morgue.\nWe couldnt use the restrooms because eventually thats where we had to temporarily put the dead.\nThe ones that died at home were left on the streets because this country ran out of resources.\nToday is my last day. Im finishing this last 24-hour shift.\nI get to go back home to the U.S.A., however, Im absolutely dreading the possibility of having to live through this again in Miami as soon as I land.\nI would return home after doing 24-hour shifts and it was difficult to fall asleep despite how tired I was. I would spend the night thinking of people crying for help.\nI remember a woman in her late 60s who took my hand and begged, Help me. I cant breathe. I dont know what happened to her. She probably died. She was not the only one: Many patients reached their hands to me and said similar things.\nWe would leave the patients to get their prescriptions and, when we came back, they had passed away.\nWe didnt even have time to go to the bathroom. Some of us decided to wear diapers. Who could imagine that wearing a soaked diaper would become part of the job?\nWe were really scared. Most of us working at the I.C.U. got infected. I started having shivers and back pain in late March. I was very hungry, but could not smell or taste the food.\nWhen I got better, I went straight back to work.\nMany nurse friends died. I would see them working on a Monday and know by Friday that they were gone. My grandfathers death from the disease struck me hard, but it was even harder to see my colleagues agonizing on a stretcher.\nThe feeling of loss has been overwhelming. I lost something every day: opportunities, moments, family, friends, neighbors. I heard people yelling and crying every night in my neighborhood. Bodies were left outside houses and were not being picked up. Their relatives begged me for help, as if I could do something.\nAt the hospital, they told us to get therapy. But almost all the hospitals psychologists left. Only one stayed. She spoke with us, with the families of the deceased, with the patients, helping with respiration techniques to calm us all. We felt miserable for not being able to help. Now I feel a little bit better.\nI did everything I humanly could.\nHeather Sten for The New York Times\nI was living out of a suitcase in between different cities in Connecticut. Id drive between several hospital sites and stay in hotels or with my partner on days off.\nMost of the patients I saw at Greenwich Hospital had Covid. We were about 15 minutes from New Rochelle.\nPeople would ask us all the time, Arent you afraid?\nHad you asked me before the pandemic, I wouldve said no. But after seeing what I saw at Greenwich Hospital, it was hard not to come home and fall asleep with a little anxiety, thinking, Today couldve been the day I got sick.\nAnd whenever I had to intubate or go into the room, theres a split second when you think of the risks involved, but then just move forward because it needs to be done.\nI think a lot of us feel the same way Id imagine soldiers do.\nIt was rather abrupt how quickly things quieted down. By early May we had fewer patients in the hospital and started having patients with health problems other than Covid. Although a lot of Covid patients didnt survive, we recently discharged some patients who recovered after hospital stays of over 40 days.\nI caught Covid at the end of March. I was out of work for a week but it took about five weeks to feel back to normal.\nApril 12 was hopefully my most intense experience during this outbreak. Id never experienced so much death in a single day.\nIt was the beginning of morning rounds when overhead came, Code blue, level eight, 100 block. This was our block, which had been converted to an I.C.U. to accommodate the influx of patients.\nWe went down the hall and gowned up. Resuscitating Covid patients is risky for the staff because of the aerosolized viral particles. I started chest compressions. The risk of exposure made the stakes and the tension high for everyone.\nCrack, crack, went his ribs as the C.P.R. continued. Its common to break ribs in the process.\nAnother epi! the senior resident called out.\nThe anesthesiologist at the head of the bed intubated the patient with a contraption placed over the patients face to prevent exposure. However, despite 20 minutes of C.P.R., we could not achieve a pulse.\nI participated in six other codes that day. I dont remember who lived and who died but I can still feel those ribs cracking under my hands.\nHeather Sten for The New York Times\nI risked my life at the front lines of the pandemic so that others could live. Im simply doing the same now for Black lives in these demonstrations.\nThe killing of Breonna Taylor was a pivotal moment for me. She was an E.M.T. So this obviously hit close to home.\nAs a paramedic, being a street medic comes naturally. On the job, we often have to work on the streets, so the environment isnt new. In these protests, Im mostly sticking to first aid, but while helping others I have to expect to be attacked by specialized police weapons.\nI work in emergency medicine in the Bronx, and that plays a big role in why I value this movement. Its obvious that people of color were disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and I fully intend to keep calling attention to the systemic racism that allowed for it.\nIve seen the heartbreak and hope this pandemic has brought to our city. I have seen sadness with the loss of life and joyous celebration from a complete recovery from this virus.\nI want to bring hope and healing. I want to save lives.\nThe most intense was the first day we opened our Covid-19 department. I remember seeing the first bunch of patients whose conditions werent that severe. They just complained of cough and fevers. It wasnt difficult to handle but it still got me frightened that Covid-19 was all over the place. I also felt dirty, thinking that now all my protective equipment is covered with virus, and I wont be able to save myself from infection or avoid bringing it home.\nThe situation in Lithuania is really calm now. Were more than happy to have gone through the first wave without much harm. We are also happy that so much more is now known about the pathophysiology of the virus itself. It will help us a lot in preparing treatment regimens.\nThe epidemic exposed the inherent weaknesses of our system. I started valuing my team a lot more. The connection between us and our experiences together are a major contributor to my work satisfaction.\nNadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times\nIn Rome, it arrived slowly.\nWe watched, distraught and impotent, the images of our colleagues in the hospitals in the north.\nThen, the city turned off. Everything was surreal. The streets were empty. The kids, at home, asked me what would become of them. The certainties diminished all at once.\nMany of the patients that I have had were elderly, torn away from their houses, from nursing homes, from loved ones.\nI experienced their gaze, full of suffering but also conscious of already having lived a full life. The elderly are already conscious of everything. They are fragile on the outside but strong on the inside.\nDifferent gazes came from the young affected by Covid. Their eyes showed anguish and fear of not being able to breathe and of dying.\nThere still remains the fear of an invisible enemy that could come back and take away our serenity, our assurance and separate us from our loved ones.\nI sweated through all my P.P.E. as I hustled to prevent the outcome I saw coming so quickly. His body was shutting down.\nWe called his wife to update her. They have four daughters together. She had dropped him off the day before and went home to self-quarantine. She had no idea that would be the last time she would see her husband alive.\nAs the day continued, I ran between his room and other very sick Covid patients rooms. Each time: P.P.E. on, P.P.E. off. Its this little dance we do all day.\nWe play music loud in the nurses station. In quiet moments, we watch zoo cams of monkeys swinging around  the best distraction. We talk about what we do on our days off. Most of us are now spending days off alone to avoid infecting our loved ones because our exposure is so high. We talk about how we will never take for granted just walking into a patients room for something.\nEvery time I went into my patients room, I talked to him. I told him who I was, what time it was and what was going on. I rubbed his back, put ChapStick on his very swollen lips and used a warm washcloth to wipe the gunk off his face.\nToward the end of my shift, I called his wife. As gently as I could, I told her we did not see him making it through the night.\nI put her on speakerphone and went into his room to put the phone up to his ear and told her she could start speaking. She broke down and pleaded with him to fight, said that she loved him, that she could not go on without him.\nI sobbed. I tried to tell her how sorry I was that we could not save him, that I tried really hard.\nI drove home that night in silence. Tears ran down my face.\nHe passed away the next day.\nJenn Ackerman for The New York Times\nThe residents have dementia and Alzheimers. The routine is not the same so it puts some stress on them, and us. Even if you have goggles and a mask and all this P.P.E., you have this nervousness inside of you.\nIve been at the protests every day since they started. Me and my wife went to bring snacks, water and milk so that when they got gassed we could put milk on them to help the burning. We drove around to see if anybody needed assistance.\nNow I go to the 38th and Chicago location where George was killed. I go there every day. I met the people who created the Say Their Name memorial cemetery, and I put up a fund-raiser on Facebook so we can make it a permanent site. What were hoping for is that people can come at any time and look at it and pray and do whatever they would like to do, as if it was an actual cemetery.\nTheres a lot of us out there. We are having conversations like, I just got off work and I was in the middle of the pandemic and then I came out here and my dedication is to the protest. We can relate. We are all exhausted. But that isnt keeping us from doing our due diligence.\nWe are thanking each other and acknowledging each others hard work. I think thats very important. No one is like, Im more important than you because Im a nurse and youre a C.N.A. or Im a doctor. Its like were all on the same level.\nIn Mexico, some people believe that the medical staff is infecting patients and that the government is paying us to kill people. Its common to hear people say, En el seguro los matan or In the social security hospitals, they kill them.\nSomeone threw bleach at a nurse in Sinaloa. A nurse in Mrida was attacked with hot coffee. People vandalized a hospital in Las Rosas in Chiapas, burned an ambulance and attacked staff.\nSome taxi drivers or bus drivers wont stop for me or my co-workers. Last week, while I was walking down the street, a man looked at my uniform and moved to the other side of the sidewalk.\nBecause of this fear, many people arrive at the hospital too late.\nThe world looks different inside the Covid area of the hospital. There is less sound. We are more expressive than before and use more body language and eye expressions because the special suit creates a barrier to oral communication. I use my hands more often when I interview my patients.\nThis week was the first that we had few new hospitalizations. The outlook seems good, but we know that we depend on peoples choices and behaviors.\nWe dont know if this peace will last, or if we will return to the war.\nWhen our colleagues started getting sick, it became really stressful. We had to do 24-hour shifts. We had no time to eat, to go to the bathroom or even sit down for a moment. My colleagues and I crumbled on several occasions.\nI remember wanting to cry and hold on to them in the emergency room, but we were not allowed to for safety reasons. The only thing we did together was pray.\nSometimes, the shifts were longer because many colleagues could not make it to the hospital: There were no buses, taxis, nor anyone else willing to drive them to work.\nAt one point, I told a cabdriver where to take me and he said: I am sorry. In that hospital, there are coronavirus patients. I cannot go there. He forced me to get out of his car.\nWhen youre a health worker, your sole purpose is to send patients home sound. In those days, that rarely happened. Most came to their final breath at the hospital. We were not prepared to see so many people dying. We would lay them on a stretcher, they would go into cardiac arrest and die.\nYou feel powerless and you are traumatized.\nOne of the elements of my job is calling family members to tell them their loved one has died. Right before Covid really hit my city, I got that call myself: My father died, very unexpectedly, of a heart attack.\nIve been making an awful lot of those calls now that Im back at work after his funeral.\nTheyre all blending together, as are the death certificates that I sign. But this juxtaposition of experiences has forced me to face head-on the problem of inevitability.\nPeople die. All people die. My father, your father, me and you.\nSo I come to work not to fight death, not to prevent death, but to support life and hope while they last.\nMy most intense experiences have been relaying messages from families to their loved ones.\nTell Pookie I love her.\nTell my husband I lit a candle for him.\nAnd I put on my protective gear  the same N95 mask Ive been wearing since the pandemic started  and I go into the room and I squeeze their hand and tell them they are loved.\nSasha Arutyunova for The New York Times\nOur I.C.U. is very busy. Its all Covid and there are so many deaths. A lot of the patients that Ive been taking care of, they go within three days.\nThe phone rings relentlessly with family and friends seeking updates. A lot of times you dont want to take off your P.P.E. to answer the phone because you could put yourself at risk. So usually I will put a glove over the phone so that I can answer.\nAbout a month ago, I had a patient on a ventilator whose husband kept calling. When I spoke with him, he said he believed in God and the power of a miracle. We said a little prayer together over the phone and I asked, Does she have a favorite song?\nHe said shes been singing Blue Bayou ever since they met. When she does laundry, when she does her hair. I knew the song and I said, I will sing it for her.\nI play songs for patients on my phone. I found out that you can have your iPhone in a sandwich bag and you can actually unlock it with your thumb. I sang it to her while it was playing. A",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation processes both support the news caption's accuracy.  The image shows a man receiving a haircut in a barbershop while wearing a mask, and a woman is providing the service; a dog sits on the man's lap. The internal check highlights the strong visual evidence aligning with the caption's description. The context of the barbershop, although not explicitly stated as Miami, is consistent with the image's aesthetic and the general setting.  The external check corroborates this, noting that while there isn't a specific article mentioning this exact event, the provided New York Times collection contains multiple articles describing the easing of lockdown measures in Miami, Florida, around the time the picture was likely taken.  These articles discuss the subsequent surge in COVID-19 cases, establishing the general context in which a scenario like the one pictured could have plausibly occurred.  The accounts of overwhelmed healthcare workers in Miami further add credence to the situation. There is no direct contradiction between the internal visual analysis and the external contextual evidence. Both support the basic claim of a man getting a haircut in a Miami barbershop after lockdown restrictions were eased.  The confidence score is slightly lower than 10 due to the lack of explicit, direct corroboration from a single article mentioning the exact event,  but the collective evidence strongly suggests the caption is accurate. There's no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization, and the visual details support the narrative given in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's accuracy. While no single article explicitly mentions the exact event, the broader context from the New York Times collection regarding the easing of lockdown measures and the subsequent surge in COVID-19 cases in Miami, Florida, aligns well with the image. The visual evidence and contextual information converge to suggest a high likelihood of the caption's truthfulness."

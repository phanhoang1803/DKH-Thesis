In fact, users who clicked the above-displayed message were greeted with a popup message requesting permission from a Facebook app to post on their behalf, making the article appear less like a hoax and more like an outright scam:\nMessages about Jaden Smith's alleged suicide were shared from various sites, and led to a variety of dodgy-sounding Facebook apps, including \"Smart Mobiles,\" \"Gadgy Land,\" \"Pakiza,\" \"Top Feeds\" and several others.\nIntrepid internet users who clicked the link and gave the app permission were eventually greeted with one of several \"news\" story claiming that Jaden Smith had committed suicide. The web sites responsible for this hoax have published dozens of fake news stories and graphics with this false claim:\nUsers who granted these apps permission to post to Facebook on their behalf quickly found this death hoax posted to their own Facebook feeds, thereby replicating itself across social media.\nJaden Smith himself has been active on his social media accounts, seemingly unaware that he's supposed to be dead. He posted a photograph of himself on 27 July 2016:",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that actor Jaden Smith committed suicide in July 2016.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal validation: A visual inspection of the provided image reveals Will Smith and Jaden Smith in what appears to be a television interview setting. There is nothing in the image itself to suggest that Jaden Smith committed suicide. The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this lack of visual evidence supporting the caption's claim, while the verdict of False indicates a direct contradiction between the image content and the caption.\n\nExternal validation: The external check provides strong evidence from a reputable source, Snopes, to confirm that the news of Jaden Smith's suicide in July 2016 was a hoax.  Snopes's high confidence score of 10 reflects the reliability of their fact-checking process and the strength of their evidence. Their explanation details how the false information spread through social media and malicious apps.  Furthermore, the fact that Jaden Smith was active on social media around that time further contradicts the suicide claim. The external check's verdict of False aligns perfectly with the internal check's findings, solidifying the conclusion.\n\nThere is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both methods independently and conclusively demonstrate that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context. The image shows Jaden Smith alive and well, directly contradicting the caption's assertion of his suicide. The external fact-check provides compelling evidence that the claim was a false and widely spread hoax. Combining the evidence, we can confidently assert that the caption is not merely inaccurate but is entirely fabricated and unrelated to the image.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong agreement and the robustness of the evidence from both checks.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes decisively refute the caption's claim of Jaden Smith's suicide in July 2016. The image shows Jaden Smith alive, and an external fact-check from Snopes confirms the suicide claim was a hoax. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks, resulting in high confidence in the conclusion."

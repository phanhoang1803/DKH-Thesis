He is currently incarcerated in a high-security Mexican prison and is in the process of being extradited to the United States.\nThis article was published on 9 January 2017, and while the author claimed that Assange made the comment at a \"conference\" over the weekend (referring to the 7th and 8th of January), the included photograph was actually taken in February 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder appeared via a video stream for a news conference in which he discussed his possible extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault charge, not improper donations from El Chapo to the Clinton Foundation.\nAs well, Times.com.mx suggested that Assange made his comment in a room full of reporters, yet no legitimate news reports or video clips have surfaced confirming that Assange made any such statment. Furthermore, Times.com.mx did not provide any links to back up their sources or any specific details (such as the time and place of this \"conference\") which could give their report credibility.\nWhile Times.com.mx does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction, this story of theirs is clearly just more fake news.",

    "explanation": "The image shows Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, a Mexican drug lord, during his arrest. The caption claims that he donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.  Internal validation reveals no visual evidence in the image to support the claim of a donation to the Clinton Foundation; the image only depicts the arrest. The internal check gives a confidence score of 10 and a verdict of False because the image provides no information about any financial transactions. External validation, using Snopes, confirms that the claim is false. Snopes' detailed investigation shows the claim originated from a dubious source and lacks supporting evidence.  Snopes explicitly refutes the news caption's assertion, providing a confidence score of 10 and a verdict of False.  The strong agreement between the internal and external checks, both with high confidence scores, definitively indicates that the caption is out of context. There's no visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image accurately depicts the arrest of El Chapo, but this visual information is unrelated to the caption's claim.  There is no visual evidence supporting the claim about donations.The lack of evidence visually and external fact-checking sites, along with highly confident (10/10) scores from both checks, strongly support the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context.  The assertion lacks any visual support and is factually incorrect according to a reputable fact-checking source.",

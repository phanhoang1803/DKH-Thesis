        "content": "Claim:\nAdam Saleh was ejected from a Delta flight for speaking Arabic.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 21 December 2016, Twitter user Adam Saleh sent a video tweet during his removal from a Delta flight, a removal that he claimed was based solely on his speaking Arabic on the plane:\nSaleh appended a video of the incident as he was escorted off the flight and a fellow passenger objected to the situation (while others approved or appeared neutral). Saleh continued tweeting his experiences with Delta on the morning of 21 December 2016 and asked other Twitter users for their assistance in reaching Delta and helping him return to his destination (New York):\nThe company sent a series of tweets to multiple users about Saleh's claims:\nIn their responses Delta asserted that \"more than 20 ... customers [expressed discomfort]\" but didn't explain why the passengers were uncomfortable, remarks that didn't go too far in discrediting the tweet's claim. (It's possible the incident was merely one of an unruly passenger's being removed from a crowded flight and was unrelated to anyone's \"speaking Arabic.\")\nSaleh's last tweet in the series indicated he managed to board a flight with a different carrier and expected to arrive in New York City later that day. At 12:15 on 21 December 2016, Delta issued a statement about the dispute:\nWe take all allegations of discrimination seriously and we are gathering all of the facts before jumping to any conclusion. Our culture requires treating everyone with respect. Furthermore, Delta people are trained to and frequently handle conflicts between passengers.\nMaintaining a safe, comfortable and orderly onboard environment is paramount for every flight and requires the cooperation of all of our customers in conjunction with adherence to directions from our crew members. This is a Delta policy and is required by U.S. regulations as well as others governing aviation worldwide.\nTwo customers were removed from Delta Flight 1 departing London-Heathrow today after a disturbance in the cabin resulted in more than 20 customers expressing their discomfort.\nWe have spoken with the customers who were removed; they were rebooked on another flight. Plans are in place to immediately speak with our crew and other passengers when the flight lands this afternoon. We will provide an update once we have more information.\nMediaite noted that Saleh has \"a history of making videos about fake anti-Muslim racial profiling incidents and prank videos about planes in particular,\" and former CNN host Soledad OBrien tweeted that a source had told her the crew was aware Saleh was a YouTube prankster:\nDelta later confirmed that aspect, posting a statement declaring that Saleh was removed from the flight he \"is a known prankster\" who \"sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior\":\nUpon landing the crew was debriefed and multiple passenger statements collected. Based on the information collected to date, it appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior, including shouting. This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight. While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.",

It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.\"\nMr Saleh said he later boarded a different flight with a different company.\n\"Once we were off the [Delta Air Lines] plane, we were told it was because we were being loud. You don't just kick someone off for being loud!\" said Mr Saleh.\nMr Saleh's friend, Slim Albaher, who was also escorted off the plane, said: \"I just froze. It was like something you'd only see in the movies.\"\nMr Saleh is well-known for carrying out pranks, which he posts on YouTube.\nEarlier this month, he claimed to have hidden in a suitcase, external and travelled from Melbourne to Sydney in the hold. It was later exposed as a hoax.\nMr Saleh has also filmed a number of experiments to see how plane passengers respond to flying alongside Muslims.\nNumerous Arabic speakers have reported being questioned, or made to leave planes, and felt it was because of their race or assumptions about their religion.\nLondon pastor Olaolu Opebiyi was removed from an easyJet plane in March, after a passenger spotted a \"prayer on his phone\" and reported him as a security threat.\nAn Iraqi university student in California said he was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight in the US after having a conversation in Arabic in April.\nFaizah Shaheen, a Muslim from Leeds, was detained by UK airport police under terror laws in August, after she was spotted reading a book on Syrian culture during her honeymoon flight.",

      "explanation": "Adam Saleh's claim that he was ejected from a Delta flight for speaking Arabic is partially supported.  Source 1 reports that Saleh claimed this, but Delta stated that he was removed due to disruptive behavior, including shouting, as reported by multiple passengers and crew members.  Source 2 corroborates these accounts, indicating that a fellow passenger felt uncomfortable and that Saleh and a companion engaged in provocative behavior.  While speaking Arabic was a contributing factor to a passenger's discomfort, Delta's official statement focuses on disruptive behavior as the primary reason for removal. Therefore, the caption is partially true but doesn't fully capture the complexity of the situation.",

    "confidence_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The original caption states that Adam Saleh was ejected from a Delta flight for speaking Arabic.  Internal validation shows a relatively high confidence (score of 10) that the image supports the claim, because it shows Adam Saleh on a plane in a seemingly tense situation, which is consistent with the caption's narrative. However, the external validation reveals a more nuanced and less certain picture (score of 6). External sources confirm that Adam Saleh claimed to have been ejected for speaking Arabic, but Delta's official statement attributes his removal to disruptive behavior, including shouting, supported by multiple passenger and crew testimonies.  The external validation indicates that while speaking Arabic might have contributed to a passenger's discomfort, it wasn't the sole reason for his removal. This discrepancy between the original caption and the external validation results leads to a lower overall confidence score. The internal validation focuses solely on the image and its consistency with the narrative of Saleh being on a plane, overlooking the crucial details of the reason for his ejection. The external sources provide contradictory information, suggesting that the caption is a simplification and doesn't fully encompass the events.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because it presents an oversimplified and potentially misleading version of events.  The image alone is insufficient to confirm the specific reason for Saleh's removal. Considering the overall evidence and the discrepancies between internal and external validations, a conservative approach is adopted, resulting in a final conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the caption's core narrative (Saleh on a plane), but external sources reveal a more complex situation where disruptive behavior, not just speaking Arabic, led to his removal. This discrepancy lowers the confidence level and indicates the caption is out of context."

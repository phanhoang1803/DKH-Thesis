      "explanation": "The image shows a woman walking past a mural that depicts a face wearing a mask and coronavirus particles.  The mural is likely located in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, given the caption's context. The entities 'A', '##bid', and '##jan' seem to be parts of \"Abidjan.\" While the image does not explicitly confirm the city's name, the context from the caption strongly suggests it's Abidjan.  Therefore, the entities seem correctly used, although with some uncertainty as the name is not fully and explicitly shown within the image.",

      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  Abidjan, being a major city, would likely have public health campaigns related to hygiene, especially during a time of a global pandemic like coronavirus. Murals are a common method for public health messaging. Therefore, a mural reminding residents of anti-coronavirus hygiene measures is believable. However, without specific information on the existence of this particular mural, the confidence score remains at 8.",
      "supporting_points": "Abidjan is a large city in the Ivory Coast; Public health campaigns are common during pandemics; Murals are a common form of public communication; Coronavirus was a global pandemic that prompted numerous public health campaigns.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the caption's claim that the image depicts a woman walking past a mural in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, promoting anti-coronavirus hygiene measures.  The internal check notes a high degree of confidence (score of 8) that the mural is in Abidjan based on the caption's context even though \"Abidjan\" isn't explicitly visible in the image.  The external check also provides a confidence score of 8, acknowledging the plausibility of such a public health mural in a major city during the coronavirus pandemic.  Both checks highlight uncertainties. The internal check points out the partial and unclear depiction of the city name, while the external check notes a lack of specific evidence confirming the mural's exact existence.  However, both checks find the scenario plausible and consistent with real-world events and practices.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both agree on the general plausibility of the caption, although neither can definitively confirm every aspect of the caption from the visual evidence alone. Given the lack of contradictory evidence and the convergence of internal and external plausibility assessments, the caption is not considered out of context. The final confidence score reflects the uncertainties noted in both validations.  The visual evidence supports the claim of a mural displaying mask-wearing and virus particles. The woman wearing a mask further reinforces the message of the mural. While we cannot independently verify the location as Abidjan without additional information, the strong context provided and the lack of visual inconsistencies lead to the conclusion that the caption is likely accurate.  There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption, but with some uncertainty due to the lack of explicit confirmation of the location and the mural's existence in external sources.  However, there are no significant contradictions, and the overall plausibility of the scenario leads to a non-OOC verdict."

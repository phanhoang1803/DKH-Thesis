        "content": "Claim:\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was trafficking children via the Ever Given cargo ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal in March 2021.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2021, a massive cargo ship called the Ever Given got stuck in the Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest shipping routes. As authorities began working on a way to dislodge the stuck ship, conspiracy theorists went to work spreading unfounded rumors claiming that the ship was being used by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a child-trafficking scheme.\nThe claim that Clinton is trafficking children via the stuck cargo ship is based on a pair of seemingly odd coincidences.\nFirst, the company that owns this ship is Evergreen Marine Corporation. According to journalist Ronald Kessler's book \"In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes with Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect,\" \"Evergreen\" was the name the Secret Service once used for Clinton.\nSecond, the call sign for this boat is \"H3RC,\" which, with a little fudging, appear to be Hillary Rodham Clinton's initials.\nWhy Clinton would leave behind clues to implicate herself in this alleged crime has not been explained. Furthermore, if there were any truth to these claims, one would expect a massive police presence at the Suez Canal as children are removed from these ships, as well as the announcement of an investigation into Clinton. None of that has come to pass, however, as this is nothing more than a perceived coincidence.\nConspiracy theories are often built by people in search of dots to connect. In this case, some social media users noticed that this international incident bore some superficial coincidences to Clinton  who has been the target of a variety of baseless QAnon and Pizzagate conspiracy theories concerning the occult and child trafficking since her run for president in 2016  and concluded that the only explanation was that Clinton was trafficking children through the Suez Canal via cargo ship. With the same barrier of evidence (taking two random factoids and forcibly drawing a line to connect them), one could argue that since this ship's International Maritime Organization (IMO) number is the same as a dentist's office in Jacksonville, Mississippi (minus the area code), this cargo ship was clearly carrying thousands of pounds of dentures.\nThe conclusion that this ship was trafficking children (and that Clinton was somehow involved) was reached despite the fact that no children have been seen in the containers aboard this ship, no records have been unearthed that would connect Clinton to this company, or that the Evergreen Marine Corporation has been in operation since the 1960s, long before Clinton first warranted Secret Service protection. It should also be noted that anti-trafficking organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, and The Polaris Project, have made no statements suggesting that this cargo ship could be carrying trafficked children.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that Hillary Clinton was trafficking children via the Ever Given cargo ship.  Internal validation finds this claim to be false because the image shows Tucker Carlson, not Hillary Clinton. The caption is completely unrelated to the image.  External validation strongly supports this finding. External sources explicitly debunk the claim about Hillary Clinton and the Ever Given, citing a lack of evidence and highlighting the baseless nature of the connection.  The external source rated the claim as \"False\" and provided detailed reasoning, including the absence of any investigation or evidence to support the claim. There is a complete mismatch between the image's content (Tucker Carlson) and the caption's content (Hillary Clinton's alleged involvement in child trafficking). Both internal and external validations unanimously agree that the caption is out of context and factually inaccurate. The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement between the internal analysis of the image and the external verification of the claim's falsity.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm that the caption is completely out of context. The image shows Tucker Carlson, while the caption falsely accuses Hillary Clinton of child trafficking via the Ever Given ship.  External sources definitively refute the claim made in the caption."

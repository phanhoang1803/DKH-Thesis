While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem's health quickly registered here at Snopes.\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem's lyrics. We're not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere's how this joke appeared on the \"Dad Jokes\" section of Reddit:\n\"In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies Eminem in the image and acknowledges that the claim about his COVID-19 diagnosis cannot be verified visually. However, the external check definitively refutes the caption's claim, citing Snopes's fact-check that debunks the rumor.  The discrepancy lies in the caption's factual inaccuracy, which is not something the image itself can confirm or deny. The image only shows Eminem; it doesn't offer any information about his health status in February 2020.  The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence from a reputable source (Snopes) that contradicts the caption's assertion. The internal check's limited scope, focusing solely on visual verification, is acknowledged, but the external evidence is decisive in determining the caption's inaccuracy.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because the factual claim it makes is demonstrably false according to reliable external sources.  In essence, while the image is of Eminem, the caption adds a false claim about his medical history that is unrelated to what's visually presented.",

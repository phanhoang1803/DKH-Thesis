        "content": "SciCheck Digest\nA study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that state-issued mask mandates were associated with significant decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates. Yet some conservative outlets and social media users falsely claim the study shows mask mandates have a negligible impact on COVID-19 outcomes.\nFull Story\nThe growth rates of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths slowed significantly in counties where states required masks, according to a study that analyzed the impacts of last years state-issued mask mandates across the country.\nThe findings support the premise that mask requirements help limit the potential exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which therefore reduces the spread of the disease, COVID-19. But conservative outlets and social media users turned those findings around to say the CDC found face masks have a negligible impact on COVID-19 outcomes and that mask mandates made no statistical difference.\nA story published by One America News Network, a conservative cable channel, on March 7, falsely claimed the CDC has admitted face masks do little to prevent the spread of the virus and that the numbers in the study didnt exceed statistical margins of error. The story has been seen by over 230,000 users on Facebook.\nA CDC spokesperson told us thats not correct.\nThe data we now have conclusively show that widespread use of masks is a very effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19, said CDCs Jasmine Reed in an email. The CDC study referenced noted that mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.\nWhat the Study Found\nThe new study cites and builds upon previous studies that have confirmed the effectiveness of mask mandates and restaurant closures in reducing COVID-19 outcomes. In this case, CDC scientists examined the association of state-issued mask mandates and on-premises restaurant dining with COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 1 to Dec. 31, 2020. To do so, it looked at data from 2,313 U.S. counties (73.6% of a total 3,142) where mask mandates were implemented and from the 3,076 (97.9%) U.S. counties that allowed restaurants to reopen, and compared that data with county-level changes in COVID-19 case and death growth rates.\nThe CDC says the study controlled for some variables such as restaurant closures in the mask mandates models and mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models, as well as bar closures, stay-at-home orders, and bans of gatherings. But it did not control for other policies that could affect case and death rates, such as closure of other types of businesses and physical distancing recommendations. It didnt account for the level of compliance and enforcement of the policies, either, and it did not make a difference between dining conditions, such as indoor or outdoor, in restaurants.\nThe study found that mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease in daily COVID-19 case growth rates within the first 20 days. The reductions in growth rates increased with time, reaching 1.1, 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8 percentage points within 21 to 40, 41 to 60, 61 to 80, and 81 to 100 days, respectively, after implementation.\nThe study also found reopening restaurants was associated with a statistically significant increase in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates 41 days after implementation, with 2.2 and 3.0 percentage point increases in the death growth rate 61 to 80 and 81 to 100 days after restrictions were lifted.\nWhat they found was that one or the other, or both, all of them, were associated with a reduction in incidence rates, Dr. Sten H. Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, told us in a phone interview.\nYet, shortly after the study was first published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report online on March 5, the information got distorted.\nHow Growth Rate Finding Was Distorted\nOn March 6, Fox News Laura Ingraham tweeted that the study found mask mandates and restaurant restrictions have a small impact on COVID-19 cases and deaths. Later that day, an unreliable Twitter account called Breaking911 created a tweet thread about the new study, falsely claiming that it found mask mandates lower COVID cases by around 1.5% over a two month period.\nBut as we already explained, the study is not showing a decrease in the number of cases and deaths but a decrease in the growth rate of the daily cases and deaths.\nBecause the growth rate is exponential, the impact compounds, Jos Luis Jimnez, an analytical and atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the study, told us. So, its kind of like your mortgage  you change your interest a little bit, and then you save a ton of money. Because the cases compound.\nThe authors of the study did not respond to an interview request from FactCheck.org. But the CDCs Gery P. Guy Jr., the lead author, told the Associated Press that although those changes in daily growth rates may sound small, they quickly add up.\nEach day that growth rate is going down, the cumulative effect  in terms of cases and deaths  adds up to be quite substantial, Guy told the AP.\nFor example, if cases were growing at 5% per day and that growth rate dropped to 3.5% per day, the total number of cases could shrink substantially, particularly over time.\nVermund told FactCheck.org since the results show changes in the daily growth rate they are much more impressive than they may appear.\nThis is actually quite a large effect, the opposite of what the scurrilous journalist said, Vermund told us, referring to the OAN story.\nNeysa Ernst, nurse manager at Johns Hopkins Medicines biocontainment unit, told us the study results are not only statistically significant, but also clinically significant. Shes been on the front lines of caring for COVID-19 patients and says every percentage point change means a lot for units like hers and overwhelmed emergency departments across the country.\nEvery percentage point has someones family member attached to that, she said in a phone interview.\nOther Distortions of the Study\nOAN News, and other posts published during the last two weeks, also falsely claimed that the results of the study were inside the margin for statistical error or that mask mandates made no statistical difference. They misunderstood a line of the study that says daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.\nBut the reference period is 20 days before implementation of mask mandates.\nThe cherry-picked quote from the study merely says there wasnt a significant difference in the daily case and death growth rates during three time periods before implementation, not after. As Guy explained to the AP, the study looked at growth rates before implementation to make sure there wasnt already a trend happening before the mask mandates were put into place.\nThe study did find statistically significant decreases after implementation of the mandates.\nVermund said these so-called pre-post analyses, which look at trends before and after you change something, are a very common way of looking at whether an intervention in a community did benefit or harm. The problem with them, he said, is that there may be other factors in the community that also change at the same time. But he said thats less of a problem when you are looking at short timeframe, like this study does.\nThe OAN story, with the headline CDC: Face Masks Dont Prevent COVID-19, Study Finds Masks Have Negligible Impact On Coronavirus Numbers, misinterprets the study even further by claiming the growth rate reductions apply to mask efficacy.\nThe masks were 0.5 percent effective in the first 20 days of the mandates and less than 2 percent effective after 100 days, it says.\nBut the CDC spokesperson said the study did not examine the effectiveness of masks.\nVermund said the lack of the actual number of cases reduced or lives saved by mask mandates makes the CDC study a little difficult to understand for the public. Still, he said, the OAN story was completely misrepresentative.\nThey dont understand anything about epidemiology, he said. The fact that you see a significant slowing of the growth rate in such a minuscule length of time  thats not negligible.\nJimnez, who is an expert in aerosols and has been working since the beginning of the pandemic to demonstrate that the virus travels through the air, told us the results of the study are significant and important because it looks at the general public, instead of results in a laboratory.\nThe results would have been even stronger, he said, if people had used masks in a more effective way early on. But the science of face masks has slowly evolved, and the study analyzed data from last year when most of the population was not using masks properly. Still, he said, the results are robust.\nMasks are essential, Jimnez said. And how could they not be for a virus that we breathe in.\nVermund agrees. He said theres no question about the efficacy of masks in reducing COVID-19, based on what he called overwhelming evidence from other studies. Whats interesting about this study, he said, is to see that in a real-world setting.\nThis was just sort of a real-world assessment that in real world use, the way people use or misuse masks, is it really worth it? And the conclusion is that its definitely worth it because you reduce the speed of growth of the epidemic, you start to blunt the magnitude of the epidemic, he said.\nThe CDC recognized the studys limitations; nonetheless, it concludes that policies that require universal mask use and prohibit dining at restaurants are important tools, along with other public health strategies, to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nSources\nGuy Jr., Gery P., et al.

However, the external validation reveals a significant discrepancy. The external check finds no evidence to support the claim in the caption regarding school closures and virus spread.  The external source focuses on a different CDC study, concerning mask mandates and restaurant reopenings, and their impact on COVID-19 case and death rates. This significant difference in the subject matter of the report undermines the caption's accuracy. The internal check's high confidence score is misleading given the crucial external evidence contradicting the caption's core statement. Because the external check provides strong evidence against the caption's claim (with a low confidence score that reflects the limited evidence on the topic), we must conclude that the caption is out of context. The lack of supporting evidence from external sources combined with the mismatch between the caption's focus on school closures and the external source's concentration on restaurant and mask mandates strongly suggests the caption does not accurately reflect the information related to the image.",

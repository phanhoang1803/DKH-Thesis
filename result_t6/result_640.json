        "content": "Claim:\nTed Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.\nOn 28 April 2017, a number of unreliable web sites began publishing stories reporting that rock musician and conservative icon Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident in Montana:\nTed Nugent, 70s rocker turned hunting guide and conservative icon, was shot and killed early this morning in a tragic hunting accident. While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

    "explanation": "The provided caption claims that Ted Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.  Both internal and external checks strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal check: The image clearly shows Ted Nugent alive and well, holding a guitar. This directly contradicts the caption's assertion of his death. The internal check's high confidence score of 10 reflects the unambiguous visual evidence.  There is no ambiguity; the picture shows a living Ted Nugent.\n\nExternal check: The external check corroborates the internal assessment.  It cites Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, which definitively debunks the rumor of Nugent's death.  Snopes provides multiple sources to support their claim, including a Facebook Live video featuring Nugent himself and statements from his representatives. The external check also has a confidence score of 10 due to the strong evidence from a reliable source.\n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. Both sources independently confirm that the caption is false. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) reinforce this conclusion.  There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image is an unaltered depiction of Ted Nugent. The image's context strongly supports the internal and external findings. There is no uncertainty or discrepancy; all evidence points to the same conclusion, thus making the claim \"Ted Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident\" completely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively confirm that the caption is false. The image shows a living Ted Nugent, and external fact-checking confirms that reports of his death are untrue."

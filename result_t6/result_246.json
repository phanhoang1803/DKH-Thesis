        "content": "Joe Biden is one year older Monday. At 81, he's the oldest president in U.S. history.\nBut some things apparently never get old, notably the strange tradition of presidential turkey pardons, which is happening again Monday as well.\n\"This is the 76th anniversary of this event, and I want you to know, I wasn't there for the first one,\" Biden said with a chuckle right before he spared \"Liberty\" and \"Bell,\" this year's turkeys from a flock in Minnesota.\nThe tradition of giving presidents turkeys to eat did, in fact, start in 1947, but of pardoning them, that's a more complicated tale.\nThis has come to be a tradition that ironically features an American president sanctioning an event sponsored by a lobbying group, which advocates the opposite of what actually takes place at said event.\nThe president makes a few jokes and lets a turkey go free in what only became a formalized occurrence at the White House in the 1980s. But the turkey lobby's actual goal, as most likely know, is to get people to eat more turkey.\nA long, strange history\nThis dance between the turkey lobby and presidents started in the 1940s, but back then, it was  a more honest  gifting of a bird for the president and his family to eat at Thanksgiving.\nBut death is a hard sell.\nMost Americans probably don't know or think about how their food gets to their tables. They really care, as surveys have found, about how it tastes and how cheap it is.\nPoliticians know this.\nRealizing the awkwardness of the whole situation  of publicly accepting a live turkey that was destined for his dinner table  John F. Kennedy broke the tradition in 1963.\n\"I think we'll just let this one grow,\" Kennedy said of the gobbling fowl with a sign around its neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"\nHe and succeeding presidents would realize, it's better to be seen as a turkey liberator rather than the one to publicly send ol' Giblet to the executioner.\nThere was a close call, though, during the George W. Bush administration when Barney, the president's plucky Scottish Terrier, almost silenced the gobble of that year's bird.\nIt took Bush hustling out of a national security meeting to call him off. And remember, this is the same dog that bit a reporter.\nGood thing Biden's German Shepherds were kept far away from the event or there might have been a real ... fowl up.\nAn expanding tradition ... for some reason\nThe birds get their royal treatment, their own hotel room and, of course, punny jokes. And despite the irony, pointed out by your author year after year, this event shows no signs of slowing down.\nIn fact, it only seems to be expanding.\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer brought the tradition to Michigan in 2022, pardoning \"Mitch E. Gander\" (get it!?). And it's slated to happen again this year.\nAlabama has apparently been doing this for decades. Oddly, the birds also, according to the Alabama Daily News, used to use the same names for the turkey every year for some reason  \"Clyde\" and \"Henrietta.\"\nThat changed this year after an online poll of Alabamians picked Giblet and Puddin'.\n\"Today, by the powers vested in me as governor of the state of Alabama,\" Gov. Kay Ivey said at this year's event, \"I hereby am granting a full pardon to Giblet and Puddin', so that they can spend their turkey day enjoying a meal of their own.\"\nLet's just hope that meal isn't what everyone else eats for Thanksgiving.\nIt's become so embedded in the culture that a town in East Texas this year decided to join in on the strange tradition and let live a turkey by the name of ... Dolly Pardon.\n\"The turkey is named Dolly because she's a strong female role model,\" Lisa Mays-Gonzalez, Van Community Library director. \"And it's a tribute to our Southern roots. And she is a very strong literacy advocate.\"\nNo word on whether the turkey can read.\nDolly is set to live out her days at the \"Believe in Vegan\" ranch.",

        "content": "The Thanksgiving turkey pardoning has become an annual tradition at the White House, but Tuesday's will be Donald Trump's first.\nWishbone and Drumstick arrived in Washington DC at the weekend, and are facing-off in an online poll to see who should be pardoned by the president (although neither will be eaten).\nThe tradition can be traced back to President Abraham Lincoln in 1863.\nHistorians claim he spared a turkey's life after his son, Tad, befriended it.\nBut yearly pardoning became an \"official\" tradition only under George H W Bush, when the former president spared a turkey's life in 1989 as animal-rights activists protested nearby.\n\"'Reprieve,' 'keep him going', or 'pardon': it's all the same for the turkey, as long as he doesn't end up on the president's holiday table,\" he said.\nMany people believe the custom was started 70 years ago by Harry Truman, because he was the first president to receive a turkey on behalf of the poultry industry as a whole. Individual farms had been gifting presidents birds since the 19th century.\nHis government launched a campaign in 1947 to encourage people to forego eating poultry and eggs on Thursdays, in order to conserve supplies to send to post-war Europe. But Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day fell on Thursdays that year causing outrage.\nPoultry growers sent crates of live chickens to the White House as part of a \"Hens for Harry\" protest campaign.\nOther presidents before Mr Bush Snr did spare birds lives, including President John F Kennedy - who gave an unofficial pardoning days before his assassination in 1963. The light-hearted event with media presence would set the tone for today's presentations.\nPresidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan were also reported to have spared some gifted turkey's lives by sending them to live on farms.\nUnder President Barack Obama, the event became an opportunity for his daughters to make rare public appearances. There has been speculation as to whether 11-year-old Barron Trump will appear at Tuesday's event.\nMr Obama became known for his \"dad jokes\" at the pardonings, in 2016 invoking questionable turkey puns like \"Yes we cran!\".\nThis year's birds, Wishbone and Drumstick, are currently staying at the Willard Intercontinental hotel, where all White House birds have stayed since 2004.\nVideos of them messing up their beds with sawdust were posted by the White House social media team.\nTheir luxury hotel stay is financed by the National Turkey Association, which continues to donate birds each year. This year's birds were raised in Alexandria, Minnesota, by the group's chairman.\nTurkey is the favourite US food for the Thanksgiving holiday, with an estimated 46 million consumed on the day annually.\nTop-Trump turkey stats\nThe Trump administration released statistic cards for both birds online alongside a poll to see which the public thought should be officially pardoned.\nThe poll spurned some users on social media to make jokes about whether he should use his pardoning on members of his administration, because of the ongoing Russian collusion investigation.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

        "content": "A lame-duck president \"pardoned\" a turkey Monday.\n\"They tell me there's 2,500 people here today looking for a pardon,\" President Biden joked at a White House ceremony on the South Lawn. After one of the turkeys, Peach, let out a few gobbles, Biden said, \"What did you say, Peach? Peach is making a last-minute plea here.\"\nHe implored the turkeys to \"keep calm and gobble on,\" then pardoned them. \"Based on your temperament and your commitment to being productive members of society,\" the president said, \"I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom.\"\nBiden noted that the birds would live out their days at the Farmamerica Agricultural Interpretive Center in Minnesota, the top-producing turkey state.\nHe hinted to this strange event's history and did so accurately, unlike many past presidents.\nNot to be snood-y about it, but this fowl tradition has a long and oft-confused history. So let's dispel the myths that get stuck in our beaks that too many have clawed onto and get to the truth of the matter.\nEven presidents have gotten it wrong\nWhich president was the first to pardon a turkey? This might be a shaggy turkey story, but bear with us.\nTo paraphrase a former president, this depends on what the definition of \"pardon\" is.\n\"This is a tradition that dates back to the presidency of Harry Truman,\" then-President George W. Bush said in 2008.\nEh. Sort of, but not when it comes to pardoning turkeys.\n\"So continuing a tradition begun 50 years ago by President Truman, I am going to keep at least -- excuse me -- one turkey off of the Thanksgiving dinner table by giving a pardon to a turkey from Ohio,\" said former President Bill Clinton in 1996.\nThat's definitely not true. And he repeated it the next year.\n\"President Truman was the first president to pardon a turkey,\" he said.\nStill not true. It got so bad that the Truman Library had to weigh in.\n\"The Library's staff has found no documents, speeches, newspaper clippings, photographs, or other contemporary records in our holdings which refer to Truman pardoning a turkey that he received as a gift in 1947, or at any other time during his Presidency,\" it said in a statement in 2003. \"Truman sometimes indicated to reporters that the turkeys he received were destined for the family dinner table.\"\nTruman was the first to be given a turkey by the National Turkey Federation, but not the first to pardon one\nThis is where the confusion comes in. The turkey lobby has been presenting presidents with turkeys since 1947, when Truman was president.\nBut, as the Truman Library notes, the post-Depression, post-World War II-era president ate his turkeys.\nAnd that was the original intent  a gift for the presidential holiday table and for Big Turkey to get attention and remind people to eat turkey for Thanksgiving, of course.\nThere's a story that suggests Abraham Lincoln was the first to let a turkey go because his son took a liking to it, but the White House Historical Association says that story is \"likely apocryphal.\"\nSo maybe it was Lincoln, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was Kennedy?\nThe first documented reprieve of a turkey during a turkey presentation from the Turkey Federation was in 1963.\nA sign hung around a turkey's neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"\nSo clearly the intent was for the president to eat it. But Kennedy, for whatever reason, said, \"We'll just let this one grow.\"\nThe L.A. Times headlined that 1963 event as a \"presidential pardon.\"\nBut it certainly wasn't official.\nWhen was the word \"pardon\" first used by a president in relation to a turkey?\nFollowing Kennedy, Nixon and Carter sent their turkeys to petting zoos. But the word \"pardon\" wasn't used until Reagan in 1987, when he presented that year's White House turkey, \"Charlie.\"\nIt was during the Iran-Contra crisis, and ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson yelled a question about whether Reagan would pardon Oliver North and John Poindexter, who were involved in the arms swap. Reagan deflected, saying, \"If they'd given me a different answer on Charlie and his future, I would have pardoned him.\"\nThe turkey pardon became an officially sanctioned White House event by George H.W. Bush\nThe elder former President Bush, Reagan's vice president, formalized the event in 1989.\n\"[L]et me assure you and this fine tom turkey,\" he said, \"that he will not end up on anyone's dinner table, not this guy  he's presented a presidential pardon as of right nowand allow him to live out his days on a children's farm not far from here.\"",

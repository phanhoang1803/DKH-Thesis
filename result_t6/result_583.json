        "content": "Claim:\nTrump wasn't really acquitted of articles of impeachment brought by the U.S. House because he didn't have a \"real\" trial with new witnesses and documents in the U.S. Senate.\nU.S. President Donald Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Dec. 18, 2019. The House had brought two articles of impeachment against Trump: obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. The charges stemmed from accusations that Trump attempted to extort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by holding up crucial military aid in exchange for damaging information about one of Trump's potential 2020 presidential rivals.\nDuring a Senate impeachment trial that concluded on Feb. 5, 2020, Trump's Republican allies in control of the Senate voted to acquit him (with one Republican, Mitt Romney, voting to convict).\nSome Snopes readers inquired about an interview given by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour on Feb. 15, 2020, in which Pelosi appeared to claim that Trump was not really acquitted in the Senate.\nIn the interview, Pelosi said that because Trump's Senate trial included no evidence or witnesses, the word \"acquittal\" does not apply. She said, \"You can't have an acquittal unless you have a trial. You can only have a trial when you have witnesses and documents. So he can say he's acquitted and the headlines can say acquitted. But he's impeached forever, branded with that, and not vindicated.\"\nPelosi was referencing the fact that a slim majority of Senate Republicans had voted against admitting new witness testimony and documentary evidence into the trial, which was a strong point of contention with Democrats. For example, John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, stated publicly that he would have been willing to testify if called.\nPelosi's opinion about the legitimacy of the Senate trial aside, Trump was in fact acquitted of the allegations made in the two articles of impeachment, with Republican majority votes to do so cast mostly along party lines.\nThe impeachment process shares some terminology with the criminal justice system, including employing terms like \"trial,\" \"acquittal\" and \"conviction.\" However impeachment is a distinct process spelled out in the Constitution and has its own set of rules and procedures. As we reported in October 2019:\nPeople often use the word impeachment when referring to the removal of a president from office. But thats not exactly how it works. The House of Representatives has the sole Power of Impeachment, as stated in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. But it is up to the Senate to convict and remove a president from office. In this way, impeachment is roughly akin to bringing formal charges against an individual. It is then up to the Senate to convict the individual on those charges.\nUnlike in criminal cases, guilt and punishment are not determined separately in an impeachment trial. Further, unlike in a criminal case, the Senate has the sole discretion to determine the rules of the trial. Therefore, one can't determine that because senators acquitted a president they found him \"not guilty\" of what he was accused of doing. An acquittal by the Senate could simply imply that they determined whatever he supposedly did didn't merit removal from office.\nIn this case, even Republicans didn't really argue that Trump hadn't actually committed the acts that formed the basis of impeachment  they just argued that the dispute should have gone through the regular court system first, or that his behavior wasn't a serious enough infraction to boot him from office. That's another difference with the criminal justice system: In impeachment cases, you can't charge someone with lesser crimes or impose a lesser sentence  it's all or nothing.",

      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects a perspective on Trump's impeachment trial.  Source 1 directly addresses the claim that Trump wasn't really acquitted because the Senate trial lacked new witnesses and documents. While the source notes that Trump was formally acquitted, it also highlights House Speaker Pelosi's view that a \"real\" trial requires witnesses and documents, implying a lack of legitimacy to the acquittal without them. The source supports both sides of the argument, making the caption's statement a fair representation of the debate.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 directly quotes Pelosi stating that \"You can't have an acquittal unless you have a trial. You can only have a trial when you have witnesses and documents.\"  The source also acknowledges that Trump was formally acquitted by the Senate, but then presents Pelosi's counter-argument, aligning with the claim in the news caption.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the accuracy of the caption, although with slightly different focuses. The internal check emphasizes the contextual accuracy of the caption by linking the image of Donald Trump to the events of his impeachment trial, even though the image does not directly depict the trial itself.  This is a valid point; the image acts as a visual representation of the central figure in the impeachment process, providing strong contextual relevance.  The confidence score of 10 reflects this strong contextual linkage. The external check, however, focuses more on the factual accuracy of the claim that Trump's acquittal was not a 'real' trial due to the lack of witnesses and documents. It cites a source that supports this view, albeit also presenting the counter-argument that Trump was formally acquitted.  The slightly lower confidence score of 8 reflects the nuances of the debate surrounding the legitimacy of the trial, which is accurately reflected in the caption, even if it presents one perspective more prominently. Overall, both checks converge on the essential accuracy of the caption: it accurately reflects a particular perspective on the events surrounding Trump's impeachment trial. The slight difference in the confidence scores stems from different assessment criteria—contextual accuracy versus factual accuracy—but these different angles strengthen the case for the caption's overall appropriateness rather than contradicting each other. The final confidence score of 9 reflects the combined strength of both internal and external validations, acknowledging the nuances and complexities involved in assessing such a statement.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check highlights the contextual relevance of the image, while the external check verifies the factual basis of the claim regarding the nature of Trump's impeachment trial.  Minor differences in confidence scores arise from differing assessment focuses but do not contradict the overall accuracy conclusion."

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions that Ebola victims are buried in body bags, not coffins, due to the contagious nature of the virus.  While the caption mentions a coffin, the evidence strongly suggests this is not standard practice during the Ebola outbreak.  The article describes a decline in the coffin-making business due to this change in burial practices.

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image clearly depicts people in medical scrubs carrying a wooden box resembling a coffin on a stretcher. The context suggests the box contains the remains of an Ebola victim. However, external validation reveals a discrepancy.  External sources indicate that Ebola victims are typically buried in body bags, not coffins, due to the highly contagious nature of the virus. This contradicts the caption's assertion. The external source provides evidence that the decline in the coffin-making industry is linked to the shift from coffins to body bags for Ebola victims.  This difference in burial practices significantly lowers the confidence in the caption's accuracy. While the image visually supports the caption's description of the action (carrying a wooden box), the external information strongly suggests that the box's contents and the burial practice depicted are not standard procedures during an Ebola outbreak. Therefore, despite the internal consistency, the external evidence renders the caption out of context. The final assessment considers both aspects. Although the visual evidence strongly suggests a coffin is being transported by medical personnel, the context of Ebola burial practices overwhelmingly points to the use of body bags instead of coffins.  This creates a conflict between the visual interpretation and the external knowledge.  Given the strong external evidence contradicting the caption's implied burial method, the confidence score is lowered, and the overall judgment is that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the caption based on the image's visual content.  External validation contradicts the caption, citing standard Ebola burial practices utilizing body bags instead of coffins. The discrepancy between visual and contextual information leads to a low confidence score and an out-of-context classification."

      "explanation": "Lime scooters have operated in San Francisco, and the Embarcadero is a location in San Francisco where such vehicles might be found.

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the accuracy of the caption. The image clearly shows a Lime scooter. The internal check correctly identifies the scooter and finds the claim that the scooter is in San Francisco plausible based on visual context. The external check corroborates this by confirming that Lime scooters operate in San Francisco and the Embarcadero is a location where one might find them.  While the external check notes that the claim about Lime urging support for mini-vehicles requires further verification to confirm the exact wording and context, the statement's plausibility is acknowledged given the company's business model.\n\nThe discrepancy is the degree of certainty: The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, while the external check gives a score of 8. This difference stems from the external check's acknowledgement of the need for further verification to confirm the specific details of Lime's statement about mini-vehicles.  However, the core assertion – that the image shows a Lime scooter in a plausible location (San Francisco) – remains strongly supported by both checks. \n\nThere is no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The visual evidence is consistent with the textual information. The image clearly depicts a Lime scooter, pedestrians, and a street scene that is consistent with the visual representation of San Francisco's urban landscape.\n\nThe overall high confidence score (9) reflects the strong agreement between visual evidence and both internal and external validation. While the external validation introduces some uncertainty about the specific statement regarding Lime's support for mini-vehicles, this does not significantly undermine the core accuracy of the caption's main assertion concerning the presence of a Lime scooter in a relevant location.  The lack of evidence suggesting external discrepancies or visual manipulation ensures the confidence remains high.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks validate the core elements of the caption: the presence of a Lime scooter. The external check expresses some uncertainty regarding a secondary claim about Lime's advocacy for mini-vehicles, slightly lowering the overall confidence but not invalidating the primary assertion."

        "content": "Hillary Clinton has thanked her supporters for helping her reach a historic moment for women - the US Democratic nomination for president.\n\"Thanks to you, we've reached a milestone,\" she told cheering crowds at a rally in New York.\nMrs Clinton hailed \"the first time in our nation's history that a woman will be a major party's nominee\".\nHours later, she won the California Democratic primary, further cementing her hold on the nomination.\nIn all, she won four of the six states voting in primaries on Tuesday, also taking New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico.\nHow last major primary night unfolded\nLive results from all six states\nGreat leap for womankind?\nWhy this election will make history\nWhat an Obama endorsement will mean for Hillary\nHer rival Bernie Sanders found victory in the Montana and North Dakota caucuses and has refused to quit the race.\nPolls had suggested the contest in California would be tight, but Mrs Clinton won by a margin of around 13%.\nThe Associated Press announced the result with more than 91% of the vote in.\nMr Sanders had been hoping for a win in that state, the country's most populous, to boost his campaign and bolster his claim to be a more viable presidential contender than Hillary Clinton.\nAs the votes were being counted, he told supporters he would remain in the race and contest the remaining primary in the District of Columbia on 14 June, despite acknowledging it was a \"very, very steep fight\".\nMr Sanders aims to sway super delegates to support him instead of Mrs Clinton at the party's convention in July, but commentators say the Vermont senator is unlikely to succeed in his bid for the nomination.\nThe AP news agency reported on Monday that Mrs Clinton already had enough delegates to qualify as the Democratic nominee.\nIn what amounted to a Democratic nomination contest victory speech, Hillary Clinton took some time to acknowledge the historic nature of her achievement. She made reference to the metaphorical glass ceiling that she has now shattered. She referenced the long struggles of the women's rights movement. And she tipped her hat to her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders.\nThen it was on to the work at hand - wrapping Donald Trump's recent controversies around his neck and pitching him into the Hudson River.\nIf Mrs Clinton has run a joyless primary campaign, it has been in part because she's spent much of it nurturing her built-in advantages within the Democratic Party and playing not to lose. Last week, in a foreign policy speech in San Diego, she went on the attack. And Tuesday night, she continued the broadsides. It's a role that allows her to show considerably more energy and passion.\nEarlier in the evening, Mr Trump focused almost exclusively on economic issues. Gone were references to Muslim immigration bans or border walls. Instead he made an explicit pitch to Bernie Sanders supporters and other Americans disaffected by the current state of the US political system.\nIt was the kind of primary night speech that will be well received by Republicans politicians who have spent the last week in a cave or a coma. The rest of the party faithful will likely be more inclined to wait and see.",

    "explanation": "The internal check has a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows Hillary Clinton, and the background is consistent with a public speaking event. The external check also supports the caption with a confidence score of 8, citing a news source mentioning Hillary Clinton addressing a rally in New York. Although the external source doesn't specify Brooklyn, the broader location in New York City is consistent with the caption's claim. The slight discrepancy in the borough mentioned is not significant enough to outweigh the strong visual evidence and the corroborating information from the external source. There are no apparent visual inconsistencies or signs of tampering or miscontextualization.  The visual details of Hillary Clinton's appearance align with her known public image and the context of a political rally.  There is no contradictory information between the image and the caption based on both internal and external verification. The internal and external checks provide sufficient converging evidence to support the caption's assertion. Given the high confidence scores and the lack of conflicting information, the caption accurately represents the image. The small uncertainty regarding the exact borough is not significant to refute the general assertion of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's claim. The internal check confirms Hillary Clinton's presence and the event's context. The external check corroborates the event's location in New York, although the exact borough is not definitively verified."

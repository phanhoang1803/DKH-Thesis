        "content": "Claim:\nTelevangelist Joel Osteen endorsed Donald Trump.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 7 October 2015, televangelist Joel Osteen made an appearance on the Kilmeade And Friendsradio show, during which Osteen said that he understood Trump's \"make our country great again\" message:\nI think [the message] resonates to, Hey, maybe the country is not where it should be. Lets get back to where we were. Like you said, Mr. Trump is an incredible communicator and brander, like Mr. Clinton said. Hes been a friend of our ministry. Hes a good man.\nSeveral months after Osteen's appearance on the Kilmeade and Friends show, his comments began to recirculate under misleading headlines which insinuated that that Osteen had officially endorsed Trump for president. For example, entertainment web site Evenin-Tea.com published a video of Osteen's comments under the title \"Guess Whos Endorsing Trump, Joel Freaking Osteen  You Done Yet? This Latest Trump Endorsement Is Gonna Rock Some Worlds.\"\nWhile Osteen's admiring comments fell far short of an actual endorsement, the televangelist still found it necessary to clarify his political position. In March 2016, his church released a statement:\nContrary to the misinformation currently making the rounds on social media, Pastor Joel Osteen has not endorsed any candidate for President of the United States.\nPreacher and televangelist Joel Osteen is the pastor at Houston-based Lakewood Church, the one of the largest in the United States.",

While Joel Osteen made positive comments about Donald Trump, stating he understood Trump's message and considered him a \"good man\",  he explicitly denied endorsing Trump for president in a statement released by his church.  Snopes cites misleading headlines and social media posts as the source of the false claim.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Televangelist Joel Osteen endorsed Donald Trump.  Internal validation found the image only shows Joel Osteen and does not provide any evidence of an endorsement.  The internal check had a confidence score of 10 and a verdict of False.  External validation, using a Snopes fact-check, confirmed that Joel Osteen did not endorse Donald Trump, despite making positive comments about him.  The Snopes fact-check provided a confidence score of 8 and a verdict of False.  The external source cites a statement released by Osteen's church clarifying that he did not endorse Trump.  Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is inaccurate.  The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement between the internal analysis of the image and the external fact-check. The image alone does not support the claim of an endorsement.  The external verification provides definitive evidence contradicting the caption's assertion, thus establishing the caption as out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm that the caption is out of context. The image lacks evidence of an endorsement, and a Snopes fact-check confirms that Joel Osteen did not endorse Donald Trump."

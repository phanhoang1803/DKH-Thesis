        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is partially supported by the evidence. Snopes confirms that a list of 53,000 deceased individuals was found on Florida's voter rolls in November 2018. However, it's crucial to note that the evidence highlights the claim that these individuals \"voted\" is false. The evidence emphasizes that the list was created by comparing voter rolls with federal Social Security files and was used to initiate a voter roll cleanup process.  The caption's wording implies actual voting by these deceased individuals, which is not supported by the fact check.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes article confirms the existence of a list containing 53,000 deceased people on Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.  The article also states that this list was used as part of an effort to remove deceased individuals from voter rolls and did not indicate that the deceased individuals had actually voted.",

    "explanation": "The image shows individuals handling what appear to be punch cards or similar ballots. There is no information about the number of deceased individuals or voter rolls in the image.  The internal check correctly identifies that the caption is completely unrelated to the image, scoring a confidence of 0. The external check, while providing supporting evidence related to the number of deceased individuals found on Florida's voter rolls in November 2018 (as reported by Snopes), highlights a crucial discrepancy. The caption implies that these 53,000 deceased people actually voted, which is explicitly contradicted by Snopes' fact-check.  Snopes clarifies that the list was used for voter roll cleanup, not as evidence of actual voting by deceased individuals. The high confidence score of 8 from the external check is based on the confirmation of the existence of the list, not the implication of voting by deceased individuals. Therefore, there's a significant mismatch between the caption's claim and the factual evidence.  Because the image offers no visual cues or context relevant to the caption's claim, and because the external source directly refutes the implication of voting by the deceased individuals, there is no justification to consider the caption as being related to the image. Therefore, the caption is out of context, with a high confidence score because of clear external validation refuting the claim and lack of any support from the image itself.  There is no visual evidence of voter fraud or any connection to the specific claim made in the caption. The image is simply generic, showing people working with what seems to be ballots of some kind, which lacks any specific information about the content or the context of those ballots. The external source only partly supports the caption, focusing instead on the cleanup process initiated by the discovery of the list. This discrepancy underlines the out-of-context nature of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds no visual connection, while the external check reveals that the caption misrepresents the facts reported in the news.  The external source supports the existence of the list but refutes the claim that the deceased individuals voted."

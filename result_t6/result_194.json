        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that a video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Both internal and external validation strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check reveals significant inconsistencies within the provided information. The video shows people destroying structures; however, there is no definitive proof that these are 5G towers, or that the event took place in China. The low confidence score (3) reflects this uncertainty. The caption is deemed misleading due to this lack of clarity.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check provides strong evidence contradicting the original caption.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, confirms that the video is miscaptioned. The video actually depicts protests in Hong Kong in August 2019 – before the COVID-19 pandemic – where protesters were tearing down a surveillance tower.  The high confidence score (10) underscores the reliability of this external source.  The external check clearly indicates that the video is unrelated to 5G towers or COVID-19, directly refuting the original claim.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is a significant discrepancy between the original caption and the findings of both internal and external validations. The internal check identifies inconsistencies in the video's context, while the external check definitively establishes the video's true origin and meaning through reliable sources.  The external check's findings outweigh the uncertainty of the internal check.\n\nVisual Evidence Analysis:\nThe video itself does not provide conclusive evidence to support the original caption. While it shows destruction of structures, it lacks clear identifying features to confirm the location, structures involved (5G tower or not), and the timeline of the event. This reinforces the need for external validation to verify the video's content and context.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the combined results of the internal and external checks and the analysis of the visual evidence, the original caption is definitively out of context (OOC). The high confidence score from the external verification (10) and the significant discrepancies revealed by the internal check (low confidence score of 3) provide a compelling case for this conclusion.  The original caption is not only misleading but factually inaccurate regarding the location, timeline, and the nature of the structures involved.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly reject the original caption. Internal inconsistencies highlight uncertainties in the video's context, while external fact-checking definitively debunks the claim, revealing that the video depicts a different event unrelated to 5G towers or COVID-19."

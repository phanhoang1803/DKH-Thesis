But all that changed very swiftly towards the end of the 80s and now most of it is gone.\n\"It was odd in that at the time the miners' strike had been and gone, there was massive redundancy in the steel industry and generally Sheffield was facing a lot of negative job numbers and was fighting for its life in many ways.\n\"So there was this strange contrast at the time between this sort of new hope that was starting to emerge out of the ground and the people really struggling and questioning what the city's future was going to be.\"\nPhotographer Tim Smith, whose work is featured in the exhibition, moved to Sheffield in 1984 to take photos for the government's 1986 \"Industry Year\" promotion.\n\"You could smell Sheffield and hear Sheffield as you drove towards it but you could not see very much of it because it all happened in these great cavernous steel mills or dusty little mesters' workshops,\" he said.\n\"I left the city [a few years later] when everything was being knocked down and before it was rebuilt.\n\"Personally for me it felt like I was witnessing the end of an era.\n\"Seeing something like Hadfield's, once the biggest steelworks in the world, being demolished made me feel really sad.\"",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check finds the image clearly depicts Castle Square, Sheffield, also known as \"Hole in the Road\", aligning with the caption's claim.  The visual evidence shows a circular underpass, a key characteristic of the \"Hole in the Road\". The high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong internal consistency.  The external check further corroborates the caption by citing a source that explicitly mentions \"Hole in the Road\" as a former Sheffield landmark demolished in the 1980s, directly supporting the caption's claim about the location and time period. The slightly lower confidence score of 8 from the external check is likely due to the reliance on a single source, although the source directly supports the claim. The overall consistency between the image, the caption, and external verification provides a high degree of confidence in the caption's accuracy. There is no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization.  The absence of conflicting information makes the assessment straightforward.  The visual elements align precisely with the textual description of the \"Hole in the Road\" in Castle Square, Sheffield during 1989.  The overall assessment concludes that the caption accurately represents the image content and historical context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows the features described in the caption, and external sources corroborate the location and time period.  There are no discrepancies or uncertainties."

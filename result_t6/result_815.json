      "supporting_points": "Urban falconry is a documented practice. Harris's hawks are a species of hawk known to be used in falconry. Los Angeles is a major city with a downtown area. The existence of a specific individual named Adam Baz as an urban falconer would require further verification.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The caption's internal consistency is high. The image clearly shows a man handling a Harris's hawk in what appears to be an urban setting. The internal check correctly identifies all entities.  The external check also supports the plausibility of the caption, acknowledging the existence of urban falconry and the use of Harris's hawks in this practice.  The slight reduction in confidence score from the external check stems from the lack of readily available information to independently verify the identity of 'Adam Baz' as a specific urban falconer.  However, the visual evidence strongly supports the overall assertion. The image itself shows no signs of tampering or miscontextualization. The visual details align perfectly with the information provided in the caption.  The man in the picture is holding a Harris's hawk in a downtown area. The overall setting and the man's attire are consistent with urban falconry practices shown in various online resources. Although definitive proof of Adam Baz's identity as an urban falconer requires further verification (e.g., corroboration from official sources or his own online presence),  the combined strength of internal and external checks, along with the strong visual evidence, makes it highly probable that the caption accurately represents the image. There is no substantial reason to doubt the claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The external check expresses some uncertainty regarding the falconer's identity but acknowledges the plausibility of the statement based on established practices. Visual evidence strongly supports the caption's claims."

        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Joe Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's atrocities against its Uyghur population as the result of \"different norms.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2021, some news outlets accused U.S. President Joe Biden of making \"horrific excuses\" for China's atrocities against its Uyghur population.\nFor example, a New York Post headline dated Feb. 17, 2021, reported, \"Biden dismisses Uighur genocide as part of Chinas 'different norms.'\" The Post reported:\n\"President Biden is dismissing the genocide against the Uighur population in China, dubbing the mass internment a 'different norm'  despite the State Department this month responding to atrocities in the camps, following reports of systemic rape and torture.\"\nThe Post's editors followed this story up with an editorial claiming Biden had made \"horrific excuses\" for the Chinese government's human rights abuses.\nThis characterization of Biden's comments during the CNN town hall was misleading.\nThe remark in question came during a Feb. 16, 2021, presidential town hall held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. During the town hall, Cooper asked Biden whether he had brought up the Chinese government's human rights abuses, namely against its Uyghur population, in his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nBiden didn't say that cultural differences are a justification for China's atrocities against Uyghurs  instead, his meaning appeared to be the opposite of that. Biden stated that Xi implicitly understood he or any U.S. president would be expected to take a position against human rights abuses by the Chinese government. Here is a transcript of full the exchange between Cooper and Biden, with the key portion bolded:\nMR. COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We must speak up for human rights. Its who we are. We cant  my comment to him was  and I know him well, and he knows me well. Were  a two-hour conversation.\nMR. COOPER: You talked about this to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I talked about this, too. And thats not so much refugee, but I talked about  I said  look, you know, Chinese leaders  if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been  the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they havent been unified at home. So the central  to vastly overstate it  the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.\nI point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea Im not going to speak out against what hes doing in Hong Kong, what hes doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful  I said  and by the  he said he  he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they  their leaders  are expected to follow.\nLater Biden indicated that Xi knew that human rights abuses by the Chinese government would result in consequences:\nMR. COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just  is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What Im doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other  other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.\nWe reached out to the White House asking for clarification on Biden's remark.\nKedenard Raymond, director of communications for the National Security Council, wrote in an emailed statement to Snopes that Biden's comment conveyed the expectation that an American president will speak out against human rights abuses:\nPresident Biden has called the oppression of the Uyghurs a genocide, and he stands against it in the strongest possible terms. In that statement, the President was speaking about the need for U.S. Presidents to speak out on universal values, which are deeply held by Americans, and about human dignity everywhere. If you look at the preceding statement, the President stated: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. As he has said publicly and in the initial rounds of calls he has made to leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China, U.S. Presidents are expected to reflect the American norms and values of advocating for human rights.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that President Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's actions against Uyghurs due to \"different norms.\"  Snopes fact-check directly addresses this claim, stating it was a mischaracterization of Biden's remarks.  While Biden mentioned \"different norms,\" the context was to highlight that a US President must uphold US values, implying he didn't excuse China's actions.  Snopes provides a transcript showing Biden's actual statements and the White House's clarification confirming he opposes China's actions against Uyghurs. Therefore the caption's assertion is false.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check acknowledges the image shows Joe Biden, aligning with the caption. However, it points out the absence of visual elements related to China or Uyghurs, thus limiting the image's direct support for the caption's core claim.  The uncertainty is further amplified by the fact that the claim focuses on Biden's alleged dismissal of atrocities, which isn't visually demonstrable. The internal check's confidence score of 8 reflects this inherent limitation.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's assertion.  It references a Snopes fact-check that directly refutes the caption's interpretation of Biden's words. The fact-check highlights that the caption misrepresents Biden's statement, emphasizing that while he mentioned \"different norms,\" the context suggests an opposition to China's actions against Uyghurs rather than an excuse or dismissal. The external check presents a confidence score of 8, based on the Snopes fact-check, the provided transcript excerpt, and the White House's statement.  The external validation strongly suggests the caption is out of context, with the claim about Biden's stance being inaccurate.  The discrepancy between the internal and external checks lies in the image's limited ability to confirm or refute the claim concerning Biden's statement on China's policies towards Uyghurs. While the image shows Biden, it offers no visual proof of the content of his speech. The external check, based on reliable sources, decisively proves that the caption's interpretation is wrong. Consequently, despite the internal check's cautious affirmation (based on Biden's presence), the compelling external evidence leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong evidence from the external check outweighing the image's limited contribution in verifying the specific claim regarding Biden's statement.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption by identifying Biden, but lacks visual evidence for the core claim.  External validation strongly refutes the caption's interpretation of Biden's statement, showing it to be a mischaracterization according to a Snopes fact-check and White House statements. The external evidence decisively outweighs the limited internal visual evidence, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

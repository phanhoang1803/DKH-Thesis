        "content": "The Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition has for more than 250 years given amateur artists the chance to have their work displayed at its prestigious London headquarters. How difficult is it to make the grade - and which now famous artists failed to persuade the Academy of their genius?\nThe exhibition, which has run uninterrupted since 1769 and featured the likes of David Hockney, Grayson Perry and Thomas Gainsborough, is described by the Academy as \"the world's largest open submission exhibition\".\nIt presents an unparalleled opportunity for amateur artists to have their work publicly displayed and then purchased, although entries are capped at 16,500 and competition is fierce - this year, more than 11,000 people submitted work but less than 10% were successful.\nWho decides?\nThe 2023 exhibition is being co-ordinated by Royal Academician David Remfry, and has the theme \"Only Connect\".\nThe 80-year-old told the BBC: \"My work was first accepted for the summer show in 1972 and I remember the joy of it.\"\nHowever, he says he too fell victim to the rigorous selection process: \"There were quite a few years after that when I wasn't so fortunate.\"\nThis year 11,204 entries came from the public, with 998 artists making the cut.\nThere will be 1,613 artworks on display, combining the creations of Royal Academicians, invited artists and the successful public submissions.\nAll of the entries are judged by the Summer Exhibition committee, co-ordinated by Mr Remfry and chaired by the president of the Royal Academy, Rebecca Salter.\nA spokesperson told the BBC that members of the committee serve in rotation, with the aim of giving each year \"a distinctive character\".\nHow does it work?\nThe process starts each January and it costs 38 to apply. The exhibition is open to anyone, from the brazenly amateur to the more seasoned artist, although there is a cap of 16,500 submissions.\nThe judges choose about 4,000 pieces from these 16,500 digitally submitted entries, and those who make the shortlist are invited to deliver their artwork to the Royal Academy for the second round. This is judged in person by the committee members, who narrow the list down again to about 1,000 successful entries.\nAcceptance can prove lucrative, with a total of about 70,000 in prize money up for grabs across a number of categories. All the artworks are also available to buy, with some having fetched over 10,000 in previous years.\nHow does rejection feel?\nThe Academy has famously rejected a number of now-acclaimed artists over the years, such as British landscape painter John Constable, whose work later sold for over 20m, and French artist Edouard Manet, whose paintings have fetched over 40m.\nIn 2018, renowned street artist Banksy submitted an artwork under the pseudonym, Bryan S Gaakman - an anagram of \"Banksy anagram\" - and was rejected. The piece was later accepted after he resent it under his name.\nHowever, some people spend years trying to feature in the exhibition without success.\nAlison Aye is one of them, suffering her 21st rejection this year.\nShe first submitted an entry in 1993 and says the 30th anniversary of that rejection \"is a really nice round-off\".\nLast year, her plight caught the attention of comedian Joe Lycett, who smuggled her entry into the gallery as part of a BBC documentary.\nLycett dubbed Ms Aye \"the queen of the rejected\" - a title the 56-year-old has fully embraced.\nMs Aye, from Bromley in south-east London, has reached the second stage once but now says that \"if I got accepted, I don't know if I would be happy - I like this sort of concept of rejection\".\nShe says when she first started applying she \"took it quite personally, especially because I went to art college, and I know a lot of people who get accepted\".\nBy now though the deflation is \"very fleeting\" and being turned down is \"a sort of a badge of honour\".\nMs Aye says for a few years there used to be an exhibition for rejected artists, but she didn't even manage to make that.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows a high degree of confidence (confidence_score: 10) that the image depicts the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and that the statement about it being closed is not contradicted by the image. However, the external validation check (confidence_score: 3) finds no evidence supporting or refuting the claim of closure.  The discrepancy arises because the image alone provides no information about the Academy's operational status. The internal check relies solely on visual identification, while the external check looks for explicit information about its closure, which is lacking. Since external verification failed to provide evidence about the Academy's closure status, the claim remains unverified.  Therefore, the caption, while not demonstrably false based on the image, is out of context because there's no independent evidence to support the claim of closure. The low confidence score (4) reflects this lack of conclusive external validation.  The visual information supports the identification of the location but not the statement about its operational status.  There is no evidence of image tampering or miscontextualization. The internal check's high confidence is based on the clear visual identification of the building, but this doesn't extend to verifying the operational statement.  To be certain, one would require additional external sources providing reliable information on the Academy's opening and closing dates.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly suggests the image shows the Royal Academy, but lacks evidence regarding its closure status. External validation finds no information to confirm or deny the closure claim.  The claim is therefore considered out-of-context due to the lack of supporting evidence."

        "content": "Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims a photograph shows a purple lobster caught in Maine.  The evidence shows that photos of a purple lobster circulated online, but they were digitally manipulated and fake.  The fact-checking site concludes that while purple lobsters are theoretically possible, there is no evidence of a genuine purple lobster catch in Maine.",

    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) that the image depicts a purple lobster, aligning with the caption's claim. However, the external check (score 1) strongly contradicts this, providing evidence that the images circulating online, including the one in question, are digitally manipulated and not genuine photographs of a lobster caught in Maine.  The external check cites sources indicating the absence of verifiable reports of purple lobster catches in Maine. This significant discrepancy necessitates a reevaluation of the caption's accuracy. While the image visually appears to show a purple lobster, the external evidence overwhelmingly suggests this is a manipulated image. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context due to the lack of genuine evidence supporting the claim of a purple lobster caught in Maine. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty arising from the internal-external conflict; the visual evidence is misleading due to image manipulation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the caption's claim based on the visual appearance of the image. However, external validation reveals that the image is digitally manipulated, refuting the claim and resulting in a final verdict of 'out of context'."

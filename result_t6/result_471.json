On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "explanation": "The claim that the image depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  Internal analysis of the image reveals a young girl with a visibly distended abdomen, which is not consistent with pregnancy alone. The girl's facial expression and overall posture do not align with the expected physical and emotional state of a pregnant minor.  More importantly, the external validation from Snopes provides definitive proof that the image is miscaptioned.  Snopes' fact-check clearly states that the photograph shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy in a hospital in Brazil, suffering from an enlarged liver and spleen, not pregnancy.  The Snopes report provides sufficient evidence to debunk the original caption. The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement between internal visual analysis and external verifiable information, confirming that the original caption is entirely fabricated and completely out of context. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty; the evidence overwhelmingly refutes the original caption's claim.  The original caption is demonstrably false and misleading.  The visual evidence, coupled with the authoritative Snopes fact-check, creates irrefutable evidence that the image was misrepresented. The detailed explanation given by Snopes, including the girl's name and medical condition, further strengthens the case against the original caption.  The consensus between internal analysis and external verification, with a high level of confidence in both, leaves no room for doubt regarding the false and misleading nature of the caption.  There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization detected in the image itself.  Furthermore, the internal assessment of the visual details aligns perfectly with the external facts established by Snopes.  The discrepancies between the original caption and the true context of the image are substantial and undeniable.  In conclusion, there is absolutely no support for the claim presented in the original caption. The combination of visual assessment and external corroboration from a reputable source establishes, with high confidence, that the original caption is completely false and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal analysis of the image and external verification from Snopes strongly refute the original caption. The image depicts a girl with a medical condition, not a pregnant child.  Snopes explicitly rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned.\""

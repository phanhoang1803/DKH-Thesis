Ron DeSantis reacted to possible COVID-19 travel restrictions by telling U.S. President Joe Biden, \"Go fuck yourself\" during a February 2021 conference call.\nIn early February 2021, social media users shared a story published by a website called Real Raw News that reported without evidence that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had told U.S. President Joe Biden, \"Go f--- yourself.\"\nIt was a quote fabricated in response to news on Feb. 10, 2021, reported by McClatchy, that the Biden administration was considering travel restrictions within the United States in an effort to mitigate the spread of more contagious mutations of the COVID-19 virus. McClatchy reported:\nThe Biden administration is considering whether to impose domestic travel restrictions, including on Florida, fearful that coronavirus mutations are threatening to reverse hard-fought progress on the pandemic.\nOutbreaks of the new variants  including a highly contagious one first identified in the United Kingdom, as well as others from South Africa and Brazil that scientists worry can evade existing vaccines  have lent urgency to a review of potential travel restrictions within the United States, one federal official said.\nDeSantis was described in news media coverage as blasting or attacking the Biden administration in response to the news. And in a Feb. 11 news conference, he made clear he was opposed to talk of possible travel restrictions imposed on Florida, calling it \"unconstitutional\" and stating, \"we will oppose it 100%.\"\nBut there is no evidence that DeSantis swore at Biden by telling him to \"go f--- yourself.\"\nThe Real Raw News story described in remarkable detail an apparently fictional conference call between DeSantis, Biden, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky, and Anthony Fauci, the head of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been at the forefront of the U.S. coronavirus pandemic response. We found no evidence that such a phone call took place.\nNo credible news outlet has reported what would be a remarkable and newsworthy exchange between the Florida governor and the president, had it actually occurred.\nDeSantis' real reaction to the possibility of new travel restrictions was, however, recorded in the following tweet:",

    "explanation": "The claim that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told President Biden \"Go fuck yourself\" during a February 2021 conference call is demonstrably false.  The internal check correctly identifies a discrepancy: the image shows DeSantis but offers no evidence of the alleged statement or conference call.  The low confidence score (6) reflects this limitation. However, the external check, using Snopes as a reliable source, decisively refutes the claim. Snopes's high confidence score (10) and detailed explanation leave no doubt that the claim is fabricated.  There is no evidence supporting the claim from any reputable news sources or official transcripts. The source cited by the original caption, while not named, is highly likely to be a disreputable source due to Snopes's analysis. The internal and external checks converge to show the caption is entirely out of context; the image simply shows DeSantis, unrelated to the false claim. The visual evidence only shows DeSantis; it cannot verify or refute the alleged verbal exchange. Therefore, reliance on external verification is crucial here. Since both the internal and external checks agree that the caption is false and out of context, with the external check providing strong, conclusive evidence, the final verdict is that the caption is OOC (out of context).",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm the caption is false. The internal check flags the lack of visual evidence for the claimed statement, while the external check definitively debunks the claim using a reliable fact-checking source (Snopes).  There is complete agreement that the caption is out of context."

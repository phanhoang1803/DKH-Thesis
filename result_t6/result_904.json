However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation processes yielded conflicting results regarding the accuracy of the news caption. The internal check, with a confidence score of 1, definitively concluded that the caption was inaccurate, citing a lack of evidence within the image to support the claim that it depicts a Bernie Sanders rally in California.  The image shows a massive crowd, but there are no visible signs, banners, or other indicators that definitively identify the event as a Bernie Sanders rally. The internal check found no elements to support the California location either.  The absence of visual clues and the complete misidentification of the event necessitates the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate concerning the specific event and location. \n\nConversely, the external check, with a confidence score of 8, asserted the caption's accuracy, referencing external sources that corroborated the existence of a large Bernie Sanders rally in California.  The external check focused on the scale of the gathering, confirming the existence of a substantial rally but acknowledging discrepancies regarding specific dates.  This external evidence centers around the confirmation of a significant rally in California, aligning with the caption's description of a 'massive' rally, but without direct visual confirmation tying the image to the described rally. The external check's findings rely heavily on the reported size of the rally and news coverage, not a direct image match.\n\nThe discrepancy arises from the different levels of evidence considered. The internal check meticulously examines the image itself for visual clues, while the external check relies on reported information about a real event. No visual evidence in the image directly links it to the specified event and location. While a large crowd is depicted, there is no information to support the claim that it's a Bernie Sanders rally in California. The internal check's high confidence stems from the complete absence of such evidence.  The external check's high confidence relies on the corroboration of a large rally in California but does not offer visual proof that the image is indeed from that event.  Since the image lacks identifying elements, the internal check's assessment of inaccuracy prevails. The external evidence, while suggesting a large California rally, provides no visual connection to the provided image, making the claim that the image depicts the rally unsupported by visual evidence. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly refutes the caption (confidence: 1), finding no visual evidence to support the claim. External validation partially supports the caption (confidence: 8) by confirming a large rally in California but lacks direct visual link to the provided image. The discrepancy highlights the limitations of relying on external sources without robust visual verification."

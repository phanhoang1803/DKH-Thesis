      "explanation": "Kestrels are birds of prey that can be found in various habitats, including areas near human settlements.  Railway stations, while not their primary habitat, are not impossible locations for a kestrel to appear, particularly in a parking area which might offer open space and potential prey (insects etc.).  Therefore the statement is plausible, though the specific instance would require verification.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate. The image clearly shows a kestrel perched on what appears to be a security camera.  While the specific location (Eskbank railway station in Midlothian) cannot be definitively confirmed from the image alone, the presence of the kestrel is consistent with the caption. The external check notes that kestrels are found in various habitats, including near human settlements, making their presence at a railway station parking area plausible.  Both checks acknowledge the limitations of visual verification in confirming the exact location. The confidence score reflects this uncertainty regarding the specific location but maintains a high level of confidence in the presence of the kestrel as depicted in the image. There are no visual discrepancies or evidence of tampering. The visual elements align well with the internal and external validation findings.  The combined assessment suggests that the caption is not out of context, even with the uncertainty regarding the exact location, due to the strong visual evidence of a kestrel and the plausibility of its presence in such a location.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, despite uncertainty regarding the precise location. Visual evidence strongly supports the presence of the kestrel."

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal validation correctly identifies that the image only shows Emma Watson and does not provide any information about her retirement.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the certainty that the image alone cannot confirm or deny the claim of retirement. However, the external validation provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, rates the claim of Emma Watson's retirement as false, citing a denial from her manager.  This external evidence significantly weakens the caption's accuracy. The discrepancy lies in the fact that the caption asserts a factual event (retirement) which is not visually verifiable from the image, while the external check directly refutes the factual claim.  The high confidence score (10) stems from the strong external evidence that refutes the caption's claim. The internal check's verdict of 'True' is based on the image's inability to confirm or deny the retirement claim, not on the veracity of the claim itself.  Therefore, based on strong external evidence, the caption is considered out of context.  There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization evident in the image; it is a straightforward portrait of Emma Watson.  The image itself provides no clues about her career status. Combining the internal and external assessments leads to the conclusion that the caption's claim about Emma Watson's retirement is inaccurate and therefore out of context with the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the image shows Emma Watson but cannot verify the retirement claim. External validation strongly refutes the retirement claim using a fact-check from Snopes, resulting in a final assessment of the caption being out of context."

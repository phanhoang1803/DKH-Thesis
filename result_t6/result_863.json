According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\nRobs a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com  where the story originated  clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press theyve had no such complaints made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims a man lost his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke.  Internal validation finds no evidence within the image to support this claim. The image shows a damaged scuba tank and emergency responders, but provides no details about the cause of the damage or the presence of marijuana. The internal check gives a confidence score of 0, indicating a complete lack of support for the caption from the image content.\n\nExternal validation strongly refutes the caption's claim.  Two sources confirm that the story is a hoax. Source 1 clarifies the story was reported in a hoax news article. Source 2 explicitly states that no such incident was reported to police in either Boston or Calgary, where the story supposedly originated.  The external check gives a confidence score of 8, demonstrating strong evidence against the claim's veracity.\n\nThe significant disagreement between the internal (0 confidence) and external (8 confidence) checks is easily resolved. The image itself contains no information confirming or denying the caption's statement. The external checks, however, provide concrete evidence that the claim is false. Because of this significant external validation, and the absence of supporting evidence in the image, we can confidently state that the caption is out of context.\n\nThere is no visual evidence within the image to support the claim. The image depicts a damaged scuba tank and emergency medical personnel, which is consistent with an accident, but there are no visuals that support the details of the caption.  There are no visual signs of marijuana, and no visual indications of the specific injury mentioned. This lack of any visual correlation with the caption further strengthens the case for the caption's inaccuracy.\n\nIn summary, the internal check's lack of support and the strong external evidence refuting the claim lead to a high confidence score (9) of the caption being out of context. The absence of visual elements corroborating the story in the image strengthens this conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation found no support for the caption within the image (confidence score 0). External validation strongly refuted the caption as a hoax (confidence score 8).  The combined evidence conclusively demonstrates that the caption is out of context."

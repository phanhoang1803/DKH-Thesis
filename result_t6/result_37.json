        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

      "explanation": "The claim that the Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum is explicitly stated as false in Source 1.  The source directly refutes the rumor, citing Tony Spera's statement that the doll never left the museum.  The source also points out that the rumor appears to have originated from a mistranslation and lacked any supporting evidence like police reports or eyewitness accounts.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum.  Internal validation reveals a discrepancy: the image shows the Annabelle doll, but it doesn't depict an escape.  The caption's claim lacks visual support within the image itself.  External validation strongly refutes the claim.  Source 1 explicitly states that the escape story is false, citing a denial from Tony Spera, the son-in-law of the Warrens who manage the museum, and the absence of supporting evidence such as police reports. The rumor's origin is attributed to a mistranslation.  Given the high confidence scores (10/10) from both internal and external validation, and the clear contradiction between the caption and the verifiable facts, the conclusion is that the caption is entirely out of context. The image simply shows the Annabelle doll, while the caption adds a false narrative of its escape. There's no ambiguity or uncertainty; both forms of validation consistently point to the falsity of the caption's claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image only shows the Annabelle doll, not an escape. External sources definitively refute the escape claim."

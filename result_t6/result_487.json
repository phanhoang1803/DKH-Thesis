      "explanation": "While Brian Kilmeade is a known commentator who sometimes expresses controversial opinions, there is no verifiable evidence currently available to confirm that he directly blamed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for Prince Philip's death.  This claim requires further verification from reputable news sources or official statements.  The statement falls into the realm of speculation without concrete evidence. Therefore, the verdict is false.  It is important to note that even if Kilmeade made such a statement, it doesn't mean it's factual.",

    "explanation": "The provided image shows Prince Harry and Meghan Markle participating in an interview.  The caption, however, claims that Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade blamed them for Prince Philip's death. This claim is not supported by the image's content. The image only depicts the subjects of the interview; it provides no information about Brian Kilmeade's statements or opinions. Internal validation reveals a complete mismatch between the image content and the caption's claim. The image offers no visual evidence to support the statement about Kilmeade's blame. External validation further confirms this discrepancy.  There is no reliable source currently available to confirm Kilmeade made such a statement, let alone that such a statement was factual. The external check highlights the absence of evidence and the high probability of misreporting or speculative journalism.  The significant discrepancy between the image's content and the caption's claim, coupled with the lack of external evidence supporting the caption, leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The confidence score reflects the certainty that the image does not provide any support for the caption's claim, and that the claim itself is likely unfounded. The absence of evidence does not confirm or deny the statement, but it prevents the image from acting as a valid contextual element supporting the claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image shows Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but offers no evidence to support the claim about Brian Kilmeade's statement. External checks revealed a lack of reliable sources confirming the statement, suggesting potential misinformation."

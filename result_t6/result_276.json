        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

      "explanation": "The caption's core claim of a goose sheltering a freezing puppy is partially supported by the evidence.  Source 1 mentions the viral story including this claim, but also states that the story's details are suspect, specifically that there's no evidence supporting the animals being \"stuck to a pole\" in Montana. The image has been circulating since 2017, likely originating in China, not Montana. While the core narrative is present in the widely shared story, the location, specific details, and the overall truthfulness are questionable according to the source.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check correctly identifies a mismatch between the caption and the image. The caption mentions a man, a pole in Montana, and a goose shaking from cold, none of which are present in the image. The image simply shows a goose sheltering a puppy with its wings. The external validation check also reveals discrepancies. While the core narrative of a goose protecting a puppy is found in various online sources, the details of the location (Montana), the situation (stuck to a pole), and the overall veracity of the story are uncertain, with sources suggesting the image might originate from China and the narrative is questionable. Both internal and external checks thus find significant discrepancies, with the external check supporting the uncertainty. There's no evidence of visual tampering in the image itself; however, the context surrounding the image is highly problematic. Given the discrepancies in crucial details like the location and the context provided, and the lack of robust verifiable supporting evidence, we can confidently conclude the caption is out of context. The confidence score reflects the certainty in the conclusion given the discrepancies in the location, the context, and uncertain verification. There is no solid confirmation regarding the location or the exact circumstances behind the image. The external evidence casts doubt on the accuracy of the caption, which further strengthens the conclusion of OOC. The validation results are consistent, indicating a clear case of the caption being out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks reveal significant inconsistencies between the caption and the image content. The caption's claims regarding location, circumstances, and the goose's condition are not supported by visual evidence or reliable external sources. The image shows a goose sheltering a puppy, but the details in the caption are unreliable."

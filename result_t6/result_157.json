    "explanation": "The internal validation shows a high degree of confidence (confidence_score: 10) that the image depicts an artist working in his studio, aligning with the caption's description. However, the external validation (confidence_score: 0) completely contradicts this, stating that there's no evidence supporting the claim about Liberian artist Kreevious Bachue, his studio location, or the specific day mentioned in the caption.  The discrepancy is substantial. The external check's lack of supporting evidence significantly undermines the internal assessment. While the image itself is consistent with the caption's general description of an artist at work, the absence of external corroboration makes the claim about the specific artist, location, and day highly unreliable. There is no mention of this artist anywhere that can support the claim and hence, the visual evidence alone is insufficient to verify the caption.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context due to the lack of external validation. The low confidence score reflects this significant uncertainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation suggests the image aligns with the caption's general description, but external validation completely refutes the specific details. The lack of external evidence outweighs the internal visual consistency, leading to an OOC judgment."

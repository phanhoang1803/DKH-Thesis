        "content": "A moment of history comes to a close\nThe closing of the queue to see the Queen lying in state brings to an end what has become a familiar sight over the last few days.\nImages of thousands of people lining up in London at all hours of the day, often in chilly temperatures, are some of the most striking to come out of this historic period.\nThe wait time at one stage was estimated to be more than 24 hours; and the queue snaked from Westminster Hall, down along the River Thames and stretched south for almost 7 miles (11km).\nThe map below shows the queue over the weekend.\nIt brought together people from all walks of life - young children, older people who remembered watching the Queen's coronation on television in 1953, and celebrities such as David Beckham who waited for 12 hours.\nSome even travelled from outside of the UK to pay their respects.\n\"Theres a profound sense of shared grief and affection for Her Majesty in this huge, diverse gathering of people from around the world,\" Canadian politician Jason Kenney wrote on Twitter as he stood in line.\nThe queue closed to members of the public at around 22:30 BST on Sunday. The Queen will continue to lie in state until 06:30 on Monday ahead of her state funeral later in the day.\nA long way to go for the end of the queue\nKristian Johnson\nReporting from Blackfriars Bridge\nShortly before 11pm, the last wristband was handed out.\nThose lucky enough to secure the final few places in the queue are now making their way past Blackfriars Bridge and are being escorted by marshals.\nThey still have a long way to go though - it is a two-mile walk from their position to the end point and they wont arrive at Westminster Hall until the early hours of Monday morning.\nSeveral people without wristbands are still following the official end of the queue, but they will not be permitted entry to the Queen's lying-in-state.\nPipers and lanterns mark Scotlands moment of reflection\nDebbie Jackson\nBBC Scotland\nScotlands moment of reflection started early with lone pipers playing sombre laments at sites in Dornoch, Fort William, Inverness and Portree.\nA spectacular display took place at The Kelpies in Falkirk, during a service at the Queen Elizabeth II canal.\nThe ceremony saw 96 lanterns - one for each year of the Queen's life - being lit and lowered into the Kelpies pool of reflection beneath the giant, 30m (98ft) high Kelpies sculptures.\nWreaths were also floated in the water as a lone piper played.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney took to the steps of the Scottish government's St Andrew's House in Edinburgh alongside cabinet members Angus Robertson, Ben Macpherson, Jenny Gilruth, and Lesley Fraser, the director general corporate.\nIn Glasgow, Rev Mark E Johnstone began a Service of Preparation at Glasgow Cathedral ahead of the silence.\nTennis Fans at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow fell silent for a minute at the Davis Cup group D match between Great Britain and Kazakhstan.\nAn image was beamed on the big screen as the moment was marked.\nCamilla says Queen was able to separate public duties and private life\nAs we reported earlier, Camilla, the Queen Consort, has paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II in a special BBC programme.\nSharing an intimate snapshot of her late mother-in-law, Camilla said the Queen made it a rule to have her \"private time and her private passions - and then her public role\". She said this was \"important\" because it allowed the monarch to define when she was on duty and when she was not.\nReferencing the Queen's love of Balmoral, where she died last week, Camilla said Scotland was where the Queen was able to \"do the things she loved\".\nCamilla also spoke of her joy at having had the opportunity to take the Queen to some of the charities she supports, such as the Medical Detection Dogs.\n\"She loved them... she asked lots of questions,\" Camilla said, adding it was \"very nice\" to take the late monarch \"to things I knew she'd enjoy\".\nYou can watch the special BBC One programme, The Eve of the State Funeral, on iPlayer here.\nLatecomers 'blessed' to join back of the queue\nKristian Johnson\nReporting from the queue\nThe end of the queue has moved to Tower Bridge, with the estimated queuing time now said to be eight hours.\nThere are still people arriving to join the crowds, including Rochelle Pearson. She has travelled from Putney to be here and spoke to the BBC after running to get a wristband from stewards.\n\"I made the decision to come half an hour ago. We just thought: 'We cant miss this iconic occasion,'\" she said.\n\"We've literally thrown everything in our rucksacks and we've just run to get here. We feel blessed to be here,\" Jessica Cooper said.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation gives a high confidence score of 10, suggesting that the image depicts a moment of silence at Waterloo Station, based solely on the visual content. However, the external validation provides a contradictory assessment with a confidence score of 0.  It indicates that the caption is inaccurate, because no reliable external source supports the claim of a two-minute silence at Waterloo Station during the timeframe implied by the image. The external check points to reporting focused on the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state and related events in Scotland, which is a different event altogether. This significant discrepancy between internal and external checks necessitates a careful evaluation. The image itself shows individuals standing still and wearing masks, which could be interpreted as a moment of silence, but this interpretation lacks definitive supporting evidence. Without corroborating evidence from news reports or official statements, the visual interpretation alone is insufficient. Considering the weight of external evidence and the lack of external confirmation for the two-minute silence at Waterloo Station, the final conclusion is that the caption is out of context.  The low confidence score (2) reflects the uncertainty introduced by the disagreement between visual interpretation and the absence of external supporting evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation suggests the image shows a moment of silence, while external validation refutes this, finding no evidence of such an event at Waterloo Station.  The lack of external corroboration outweighs the internal visual interpretation, resulting in a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

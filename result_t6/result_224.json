    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal validation gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows people near the entrance of a building identified as a school.  The caption accurately reflects this visual information.  The lack of explicit mention of the building's use as a polling station doesn't invalidate the caption, as the context suggests it's plausible.  \n\nThe external validation offers a slightly lower confidence score (7) because while source 1 supports the possibility of schools being used as polling stations, it doesn't explicitly confirm this particular school's use in that capacity. The external source also doesn't directly confirm that the people are at the entrance, instead implying it through context. This discrepancy, however, is minor. The core claim of the caption – that people are at a school entrance – is visually confirmed and contextually reasonable. \n\nConsidering both internal and external validations, there is no significant discrepancy. The visual evidence strongly supports the caption's core claim.  The external source provides supplementary context to strengthen the plausibility of the caption, even if it doesn't perfectly mirror the caption's wording. While there's a minor difference in the specificity of location (entrance vs. general vicinity), this is not enough to deem the caption out of context.  Hence, the final assessment is that the caption is not out of context and has a confidence score of 8 reflecting minor uncertainty due to the external source's slightly less precise description.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, confirming the visual details. External validation provides contextual support for the possibility of a school being used as a polling station, although it doesn't explicitly confirm the specifics.  The minor discrepancies do not invalidate the caption's accuracy."

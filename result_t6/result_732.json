        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that the Annabelle doll escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut.  Snopes.com directly addresses this claim, stating that it is false and that the doll never left the museum.  Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, explicitly denied the escape in a YouTube video.  The rumor appears to have originated from a mistranslation.  The fact-check article provides strong evidence contradicting the caption.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds partial alignment between the image and caption. The image shows the Annabelle doll, aligning with the caption's mention of the doll. However, the caption claims the doll escaped from a Connecticut museum, which the image does not depict. The internal check's confidence is high (10) because the visual evidence clearly shows the Annabelle doll.\n\nThe external validation provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim of the doll's escape.  Snopes.com and a statement by Tony Spera directly refute the escape narrative. The external check also has a high confidence score (10) due to the reliable sources used. \n\nThe discrepancy lies in the caption's claim of the doll's escape. While the image accurately depicts the doll, it offers no evidence to support its escape from the museum. The external evidence decisively refutes this claim. Because the external check relies on verified fact-checking and a statement from a person directly involved, it overrides the partial alignment noted in the internal check. Therefore, the caption is out of context (OOC) because the central claim of the doll's escape is false.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds partial image-caption alignment, but external validation strongly refutes the caption's central claim of the doll's escape. The external evidence is decisive, resulting in an OOC verdict."

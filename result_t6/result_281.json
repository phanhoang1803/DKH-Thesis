The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

Snopes rates the claim as false, citing the absence of any official announcements or credible news reports supporting the remake.  The evidence highlights that an image circulating online was a fan-made poster, not a genuine Disney announcement.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes fact-check explicitly states that Disney has not announced a remake of 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' with Kate Winslet.

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (confidence_score: 10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content: a poster for the movie \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" featuring Kate Winslet. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  The Snopes fact-check (confidence_score: 10) strongly refutes the claim in the caption, stating that Disney did not announce a remake of the film and that the circulating image, including the one provided, is a fan-made poster.  There's no ambiguity in the external evidence; Snopes provides a definitive assessment.  The discrepancy arises from a misrepresentation of the image's origin. The image itself is perfectly consistent with the caption, showing the movie title and actress. The out-of-context nature stems from the fact that the image is not from an official Disney announcement, as the caption implicitly suggests. Therefore, the caption is misleading because it presents the fan-made poster as evidence of an official Disney announcement.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy concerning the image content. However, external validation from Snopes definitively proves that the caption's claim of an official Disney remake announcement is false; the image is a fan-made poster. This leads to a final verdict of the caption being out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

Source 1 explicitly mentions photographs circulating on social media showing \"a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm\". While the source casts doubt on the exact circumstances and location of the event, the core claim of the bird warming the puppy is directly addressed and visually depicted in the photographs mentioned.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both support the caption's claim.  The internal check directly assesses the image, finding a strong visual match between the image content and the caption's description. The goose appears to be sheltering the puppy, suggesting an attempt to keep it warm. The confidence score of 10 reflects this strong visual agreement. The external check further corroborates this by referencing sources showing similar images circulating online with captions describing a bird (identified as either a goose or duck) keeping a puppy warm. Although the external source expresses some uncertainty regarding the exact context and location, it does not contradict the core message of the captionâ€”that a bird is providing warmth to a puppy. The confidence score of 8 from the external check, while slightly lower, remains supportive of the caption's accuracy, given the visual evidence and the consistent narrative found online.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external validation. Both align in supporting the caption's core claim, and the overall confidence is high because of the consistent visual evidence in the image and the corroborating external sources.  No visual tampering or miscontextualization is evident. The image clearly shows the bird sheltering the puppy, a visual detail consistent with the caption's assertion.  There are no unsupported claims or assumptions made. The assessment is conservative and prioritizes verifiable facts, and no uncertainties were found in either the internal or external checks.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly support the caption.  Visual evidence clearly shows the bird sheltering the puppy, while external sources corroborate the claim with similar images and descriptions. No significant discrepancies or uncertainties were identified."

        "content": "Claim:\nA Colorado hunter claimed he was sexually assaulted by a Sasquatch.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn May 2017, people on social media got wind of an article about a Colorado hunter who apparently claimed that a Sasquatch (a creature of legend also known as Bigfoot or, in some circles, the Yeti) sexually assaulted him:\nThe article was published by World News Daily Report on 11 May 2017:\nThe 57-year old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday, to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter.\nAll of a sudden, a large gorilla-like creature dropped from a tree in front of him punched him in the face ... While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.\nWhen I regained consciousness, he had already torn my pants and was tearing through my underwear. I stabbed him in the shoulder with my hunting knife, and that made him run away.\nThe item included a photograph of large footprints, purportedly captured at the scene of the incident. That image dated back to at least 2011, and was unrelated to any incidents involving a hunter versus Bigfoot encounter in 2017.\nHowever, all of this is beside the point, because there is no truth to this story; World News Daily Report admits on its own disclaimer page that all of its site content is fictional:\nWNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website  even those based on real people  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a person in a white fluffy suit in a snowy forest. The caption describes a Colorado hunter's claim of sexual assault by a Sasquatch (Bigfoot or Yeti).  The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch; the image contains no Sasquatch or evidence related to a sexual assault. The confidence score of 0 reflects the lack of visual connection between the image and the caption.  The external check confirms the story's falsity. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, verifies that the story originates from World News Daily Report, a site known for publishing fictional content. This corroboration significantly strengthens the assessment that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check reflects the definitive evidence from a reliable source. There is no visual discrepancy to consider, as the image is straightforward and the claim is completely unrelated.  The internal and external checks align in their assessment that the caption is factually incorrect and completely unrelated to the visual content. The absence of any visual component related to the caption's narrative (a Sasquatch, a hunter, or any indication of assault) further reinforces this assessment. Therefore, the caption is demonstrably out of context. The combined evidence from both checks results in a high degree of certainty that the caption is entirely unrelated to the visual content of the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks conclusively show that the news caption is entirely unrelated to the image. The image depicts a person in a snowy forest, while the caption describes a fictional story about a Sasquatch sexual assault claim."

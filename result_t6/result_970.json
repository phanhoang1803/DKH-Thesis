        "content": "Claim:\nA video captures a cat with an extremely deep meow.\nIn May 2017, a 2015 video featuring a cat with an unusually deep voice inexplicably went viral, and was duly picked up by various tabloids:\nDont let this cats small stature fool you  he has a bass voice that would put Barry White to shame.\nIn a video filmed by the kittys owner, hes just chilling on the kitchen counter. Unsurprisingly, his ridiculously low voice has gone viral, with a lot of people wondering how its physically possible for such a tiny cat to produce such a noise.\nThere are several reasons to be skeptical about this footage. The video was originally posted to YouTube by \"Cash CatFlava\" in December 2015, bearing the description \"So this is Jack and he has some sort of type of laryngeal paralysis? At least thats what the vet told me.\"\nSome cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: \"While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat's meow, I've yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat's meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn't change over time!\"\nAccording to the American College of Veterinarian Surgeons, a cat with laryngeal paralysis may display harsh panting or a coarse (not deeper) voice:\nIn dogs and cats with laryngeal paralysis, the muscles that normally pull the airway open do not function properly. When an affected pet breathes in, the walls of the airway do not pull openrather, they are sucked into the opening, or in severe cases sucked shut. Early in the condition, this creates increased noise when they breathe; later, it can completely obstruct their airway, and they can suffocate. The early signs of laryngeal paralysis can be quite subtle.\nYou may notice:\nharshness in their panting\nincreased panting or panting when cool and calm\na hoarse or raspy-sounding bark\nA video of a cat suffering from laryngeal paralysis shows that their meows are not comically deep, but squeaky (and arguably a little sad):\nOur attempts to find similar videos of cats with unusually deep voices were unsuccessful. In fact, the only similar video we could uncover was uploaded by the same YouTube account, Cash Cat Flava, in October 2013:\nSetting aside for the moment what a coincidence it would be that the same person has come across two cats with laryngeal paralysis who sound identical, this video actually gives itself away as a fakery in the first few seconds. Before the cat exits the house, you can hear audio of its actual regular-pitched meow.",

      "explanation": "Source 1 directly addresses the claim of a cat with an unusually deep voice. While it mentions a viral video of such a cat, it concludes that the video was likely overdubbed and that a deep meow is not a known symptom of laryngeal paralysis, a condition the cat in the video was purported to have.  The source provides details from veterinary experts, which adds weight to its conclusion.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a tuxedo cat. The caption claims the cat has an unusually deep voice.  The internal check noted the absence of audio, leading to a low confidence score (7) and a verdict of 'False' because the claim couldn't be verified from the image alone.  The external check, however, strongly supports this assessment (confidence score of 8).  It cites a source that analyzed a similar viral video of a supposedly deep-voiced cat. This source, which included veterinary expert opinions, concludes the video's deep meow was likely overdubbed, as such a deep voice isn't a recognized symptom of the condition it was attributed to.  The high external confidence score and supporting evidence from vet experts substantially bolster the internal check's conclusion. Thus, the image alone does not support the claim of an unusually deep voice, and external sources confirm this is likely misattributed. Therefore, the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is out of context. The internal check flags the lack of audio evidence. The external check provides strong evidence indicating the claim is likely false and possibly due to misrepresentation."

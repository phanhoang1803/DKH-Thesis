They go through a lot just to bring forth new life.\nToday I cried bitterly because I lost a woman, we don't pray for things like this to happen but sometimes God may have other plans. Why is this woman's case so painful? She has been barren for 14 years! We have tried IVF & so many method known to man, the woman went through a lot.\nFinally God blessed her, it was way beyond science and human knowledge. She just got pregnant despite the fact she has ovarian cyst and huge load of fibroids, brethren she got pregnant. Her fibroid started melting and everything was OK, I know that's God, he will do things just to show off his glory and awesomeness.\nAfter 9 months, it was time, her husband rushed her to the hospital and quickly I left everything that I was doing and attended to her. She laboured for hours, after 7 hours, it was so painful so we decided to open her up.\nWe lost her but the baby was alive,. Before her death, she held the baby in her arms and smiled \"God is great\" and then she gave up the ghost.\nI was devastated and sad, I went to broke the news to her husband myself, upon hearing the news, her husband fainted, their happy day just turned sour. We lost a live just to deliver a new life today.\nPlease respect women because they pass through the valley of death to bring life. Respect your wife! Carrying your baby for 9 months is no jokes and labouring for hours to give birth to your children is a huge sacrifice.\nI pray to God to please protect everyone reading this, especially pregnant women, please put them in your prayers. Dear husband, I repeat respect your wife because she is truly the giver of life. May God strengthen all pregnant women, you will all deliver your babies like the women of Hebrew.\nDon't ignore this post, share to others it is very important because the women in our lives should be worshipped. Please if you are having problems with your mother and you refused to call her, I beg you to CALL HER NOW! she went through hell to give birth to you. Show some love to women, they are super. Please share.\nGOD BLESS WOMEN ?",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects the information in Source 1.  The source describes an unnamed doctor recounting the story of a woman who, after years of infertility, became pregnant and gave birth, only to die shortly after childbirth. The source explicitly mentions the woman's prior infertility struggles, the difficult labor requiring a Cesarean section, and her death after delivering a live baby. ",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: The doctor's account details the woman's 14-year struggle with infertility, successful pregnancy despite medical challenges (ovarian cysts and fibroids), difficult labor leading to a Cesarean section, and the mother's death after holding her baby.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both support the caption's accuracy, although with some caveats.  The internal check notes that while the image shows a distraught doctor, it doesn't directly depict the specifics of the news story. However, the doctor's emotional state is consistent with the implied tragedy in the caption. The external check strongly supports the caption by citing a news source detailing the events described in the caption: a woman's death after childbirth following years of infertility and a difficult delivery. Both internal and external checks give a confidence score of 8, suggesting a high level of agreement. There's no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The visual element supports the caption's narrative by showing a doctor's emotional distress, aligning with the tragic events described in the news source.  The absence of direct visual representation of the specific events in the caption doesn't negate the overall agreement. Therefore, the caption is deemed not out of context (OOC=false), and a confidence score of 8 reflects the confidence in this assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation support the caption's accuracy.  The image shows a distraught doctor, aligning with the tragic events described in the news source, which provides details corroborating the caption's narrative."

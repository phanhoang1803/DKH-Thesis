    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) that the caption accurately reflects the image, based on the visual resemblance of the background mountains to the Isle of Skye.  However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy. The external check (score 3) indicates a lack of supporting evidence from external sources. The external source focuses on the impact of rabbits and sheep grazing on Skye, but it doesn't directly support the claim that the sheep in the image is \"looking to Skye.\" The caption's vagueness and the absence of explicit corroboration from external sources weaken its accuracy. The discrepancy arises from the difference in interpretation. While the internal check relies on visual similarity, the external check demands explicit textual evidence. The low confidence score of the external check and the absence of concrete textual evidence in the provided context, despite the visual plausibility suggested by the internal check, lead to the conclusion that the caption may be out of context. Therefore, the final verdict is 'OOC: True'. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty introduced by the contradictory assessment from the external check and the vagueness of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption (confidence 10), while the external check provides weak evidence against it (confidence 3).  The vagueness of the caption and the lack of explicit external support lead to an overall low confidence and the conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

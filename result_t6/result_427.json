        "content": "Claim:\nAn episode of \"The Simpsons\" predicted that U.S. President Donald Trump would cancel his trip to Denmark after the prime minister refused to sell Greenland to the United States.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nThe animated show \"The Simpsons\" has garnered a reputation for \"predicting\" future events during the course of its nearly 30-year run. While a few odd coincidences exist, Simpsons prediction hoaxes may outnumber actual Simpsons predictions.\nFor example, \"The Simpsons\" did not predict that U.S. President Donald Trump would ride down an escalator while announcing his bid for president; Lady Gaga's Superbowl halftime show; the video game Pokemon Go; the fire at Notre Dame cathedral; a mass shooting during a screening of \"Black Panther\"; Trump's touching a glowing orb; or Trump's death.\nIn August 2019, after Trump mulled the idea of buying Greenland and then announced that he was canceling a trip to the area after Denmark's prime minister rejected the idea, another Simpsons \"prediction\" started to circulate on social media.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a message on Twitter about how the animated show had predicted the kerfuffle.\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow made a similar joke on Twitter:\nWhile these tweets were likely posted in jest, some people didn't quite get the joke. At least two threads were started on \"The Simpsons\" section of Reddit asking if the prediction was real, and multiple people chimed in on Twitter about the show's uncanny ability to tell the future. Murphy's tweet was also shared on Fark as proof that \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening had a time machine.\nWe searched Frinkiac, a website named after the Simpsons' bumbling mad-scientist character Professor Frink. The site allows fans to search the show's archives for favorite quotes and jokes. And nothing surfaced for mentions of the words \"Greenland,\" \"Trump,\" and \"Denmark\" together.\nFurthermore, we've previously covered the show's \"predictions\" about Trump's presidency. And as far as we can tell, the first mention of a \"President Trump\" came during the season 11 episode, \"Bart to the Future,\" in 2000. Trump was mentioned in prior seasons, but never as president or a potential buyer of Greenland:",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The image shows Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, holding a Simpsons pillow.  The caption, however, refers to a Simpsons episode that supposedly predicted a specific political event involving Donald Trump, Denmark, and Greenland.  There is no visual evidence in the image to support the claim made in the caption. The internal check correctly identifies the disconnect between the image and the caption, scoring zero confidence in the caption's accuracy. The external check further strengthens this assessment by referencing a fact-checking source (Snopes or similar) that debunks the claim about the Simpsons prediction, providing a high confidence score (8) for the falsity of the caption.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external validation; both methods independently arrive at the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  No visual discrepancies or tampering are noted. The image's content is directly opposed to the narrative presented in the caption. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is entirely out of context with a high degree of certainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods independently confirm that the provided caption is out of context with respect to the image. The image depicts Matt Groening with a Simpsons pillow, while the caption discusses a supposedly predictive Simpsons episode regarding a real-world political event. External fact-checking reinforces the disconnect."

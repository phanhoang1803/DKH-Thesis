While the exact vote count may require verification against official election data, receiving more than seven million votes is not improbable for a presidential election in a large country like the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The description of him as \"largely untested\" is subjective and could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context and perspective. Therefore, the statement's overall plausibility relies on the acceptance of the election results as factual.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows Felix Tshisekedi, aligning with the caption's subject. The internal check highlights the image's context suggesting a post-election scenario, consistent with the caption's mention of election results.  The external check corroborates Tshisekedi's victory in the 2018 Congolese presidential election and the plausibility of receiving over seven million votes.  While the exact vote count would require further verification against official election data, it is not improbable given the DRC's large population. There's a slight discrepancy regarding the description of Tshisekedi as \"largely untested,\" which is subjective and depends on the perspective. However, the core claim regarding his victory and vote count aligns with external evidence. This subjective element marginally lowers the confidence score, but the overall consistency between visual evidence, internal contextual analysis, and external facts validates the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows Felix Tshisekedi, and external sources confirm his 2018 election victory. A slight discrepancy about the description of him as \"largely untested\" exists but does not outweigh the supporting evidence."

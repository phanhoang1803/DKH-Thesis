Brian Kemp and his mother dressed in KKK garb.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image circulated on social media shows a young boy and a woman dressed in Klu Klux Klan (KKK) robes and hoods, with a caption identifying the pictured persons as now-Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and his mother:\nNo evidence suggests this is actually a picture of the Georgia governor or his mother. The photograph is part of the Bettmann Archive, available through the visual media company Getty Images with a caption noting that the identities of the pictured persons are unknown:\nMore important, Getty Images lists the creation date for this photograph as April 27, 1956. As Brian Kemp was born in 1963, it is not temporally possible that he could be the young boy seen here.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that the image shows Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and his mother dressed in KKK robes.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal validation focuses on the visual content of the image itself. The image clearly depicts a young boy and a woman wearing KKK regalia. The internal check correctly identifies the presence of KKK attire but finds the caption's identification of the individuals as Gov. Kemp and his mother to be factually incorrect. The confidence score of 10 reflects the clear visual evidence contradicting the caption's claim.  The internal check's high confidence score reflects the unambiguous visual evidence.\n\nExternal validation corroborates this finding. It confirms that the image indeed circulated on social media with a false caption identifying the individuals as Gov. Kemp and his mother.  External sources provide further evidence debunking the claim, indicating that the image is unrelated to Gov. Kemp. The external check's confidence score of 10 also reflects the strong evidence against the caption's claim, which is supported by independent fact-checking efforts.\n\nThere is complete agreement between internal and external validation. Both methods independently confirm that the caption is inaccurate and misrepresents the individuals in the image. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) further strengthen this conclusion.  There's no ambiguity or uncertainty in the visual evidence or external sources.\n\nNo visual tampering or miscontextualization is detected. The image clearly shows the individuals in KKK attire.  The discrepancy lies solely in the inaccurate identification of the persons in the photograph.  There is no evidence presented suggesting the picture has been altered or manipulated. The visual details align perfectly with the internal and external findings, confirming the falsity of the original caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation conclusively demonstrate that the original caption is out of context. The image shows a young boy and a woman in KKK robes, but they are not Gov. Brian Kemp and his mother as the caption falsely claims."

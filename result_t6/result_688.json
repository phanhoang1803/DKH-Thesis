    "explanation": "The original news caption states that the festival marks the finding of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, according to Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.  Both the internal and external checks support this claim.  The internal check notes that the image shows a woman who appears to be Ethiopian Orthodox, holding a candle, aligning with the religious context of the festival. The connection to Jesus is inferential from the context, but visually supported by the religious setting implied.  The external check provides strong support, citing a source directly describing the Meskel festival as marking the finding of the cross according to Ethiopian Orthodox tradition. The high confidence scores from both checks (8 and 10, respectively) reinforce the validity of the caption. There is no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization. The image complements the caption's description by showing a woman participating in what appears to be a religious ceremony, consistent with the Meskel festival. While the image doesn't explicitly depict the finding of the cross, it depicts a scene consistent with the religious observance described in the caption, hence lending visual support to the textual claim.  The overall high confidence score is based on both the strong visual alignment with the description provided and external verification confirming the accuracy of the description of the Meskel festival's significance within Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity. No discrepancies exist between internal and external checks; both independently support the caption's accuracy. The only inferential element, the connection between the image and Jesus, is made clear by the established connection to the Meskel festival and the religious context of the image itself.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The image visually aligns with the described religious context, and external sources confirm the festival's significance as described."

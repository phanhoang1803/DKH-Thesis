        "content": "Tractor rule change sparks row on car-free island\nOn the car-free island of Sark, bicycles and tractors are the go-to mode of transport - except for Sundays when tractors are not allowed to be driven.\nBut now a group of politicians on the tiny Channel Island with a population of about 580 are trying to change that, arguing Sunday is no longer considered a day of rest.\nThe move has sparked a row among residents - including one dubbed \"The King of Sark\" - who want to preserve the tradition.\nOthers argue times have changed and Sark needs to adapt.\nThe proposition to change the law has been submitted by members of the Douzaine, the body which looks after roads on the island, to be considered by the Chief Pleas in early July.\nAt the moment, tractors are the only motor vehicles which may be driven on the island - but their use is restricted to six days of the week.\nSome people, however, have special permission to drive their tractor seven days a week.\nMembers of Sark's government have asked for the law to be changed so all tractors may be driven at any time.\n'Another working day'\nIn the proposition submitted by Conseiller Chris Bateson, chairman of the Douzaine, he wrote that \"there has been a gradual shift from the notion of 'keeping Sunday special' to it becoming 'just another working day'\".\nHis opinion was echoed by Bernadette Southern, chef at restaurant Fleur du Jardin, who said: \"It's totally different to what it was years ago, when Sunday was a relaxing day.\"\nShe also said the summer season was now so short it was \"essential\" farmers and other people who needed tractors should be able to use them seven days a week.\nShe said: \"The boats change through the winter, so there aren't the same number of tourists. Everybody needs to make their money through the summertime.\n\"Times really do need to change. I think everything else is changing so this needs to change too.\"\n'Sort it out'\nHowever, Jason Salisbury, of Sark Dairy, said he believed the law should remain as it was, saying it was a selling point for tourists that the island was traffic-free, and that keeping one day a week with minimal tractor movement would \"keep Sark special\".\nHe said he did not want to work on Sundays despite working in agriculture.\nHe said: \"If you can't organise yourself not to try during a particular time, then you need to sort it out.\"\nAs a compromise, Mr Salisbury suggested restricting tractors between 10:00 and 15:00, except for emergency services.\n'A slippery slope'\nPeter Plummer, nicknamed the King of Sark, drives the tractor-towed bus service, known locally as the \"toast rack\" because of the shape of its passenger-carrying trailer, taking visitors up and down Harbour Hill on arrival and when leaving the island.\nHe holds special permission to drive his vehicle seven days a week and said he did not think the rule should be changed to allow everyone to do the same.\n\"If the rule is changed, I think people will take it for granted.\n\"It's a slippery slope - at what point do you say no?\"\nHe said that, despite dwindling summer seasons, allowing more tractor movement, and with it more dust and noise, would hurt the tourist economy rather than help it.",

      "explanation": "The provided text discusses a debate on Sark island regarding allowing tractors on Sundays. While it mentions that currently tractors are not allowed on Sundays, and some argue that Sunday is no longer a day of rest, it doesn't directly state that Sunday is the *closest* farmers get to a day of rest.  The evidence shows some farmers want to work on Sundays, contradicting the caption's implication that Sunday is their closest thing to a rest day.  The caption is partially supported but not fully accurate.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 mentions that on Sark Island, tractors are not allowed to be driven on Sundays.  It also includes quotes from individuals with differing opinions on whether this rule should change. Some argue Sunday is no longer a day of rest, and others want to maintain the tradition of a day of rest.  One farmer, Jason Salisbury, states he doesn't want to work on Sundays.",

    "explanation": "The internal check has low confidence because there is no entity in the caption that can be verified against the image. The external check reveals that the caption is inaccurate. The caption states that Sunday is the closest farmers get to a day of rest. However, the external source discusses a debate on Sark Island about whether to allow tractors on Sundays. This debate implies that some farmers *do* want to work on Sundays, which directly contradicts the caption's claim.  The external source provides evidence of differing opinions among farmers about working on Sundays, which is inconsistent with the caption's assertion. The image shows a tractor in a field, which is visually consistent with agricultural work. However, the image alone doesn't confirm or deny whether Sunday is the closest farmers get to a day of rest.  The disagreement between the caption and the external information, coupled with the lack of direct support from the image, leads to a conclusion that the caption is out of context. The confidence score reflects the certainty based on the external evidence countering the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation is inconclusive due to lack of textual entities in the caption. External validation strongly suggests the caption is inaccurate, as evidenced by a debate on Sark Island regarding tractor use on Sundays. The image itself provides no direct confirmation or denial of the caption."

        "content": "Awe-inspiring photographs of fast jets surrounded by a split-second shockwave arent evidence of a plane breaking the sound barrier. BBC Future looks at what causes them.\nIts an eye-catching sight that has been captured by photographers and camera crews time and again; a military jet sweeps in low and fast, travelling at hundreds of miles an hour. As it picks up speed, it begins to be surrounded by a giant cone of vapour, a cloud that seems to erupt around the aircraft.\nThat, were often told in excitable captions, is a sonic boom.\nExcept, it isnt  or at least, not quite. What youre seeing is a physical effect that takes place as an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, but its not the sonic boom itself.\nAs aircraft design has become more sophisticated, planes have become more streamlined, and faster  and begun to do things to the air around them that they just werent able to do when they were slower and more cumbersome. And the mystery shockwaves that surround, low, fast-flying planes as they approach and then pass the sound barrier are proof that the air starts to do some very strange things at such speeds.\nSo what are these mystery vapour cones?\nRod Irvine, the chairman of the Royal Aeronautical Societys aerodynamics group, says the conditions that create the vapour cone all lead toward the breaking of the sound barrier  but the cones are usually photographed at speeds just below the speed of sound.\nFlying so close to the ground, the air is denser and creates more friction and drag  and, anyway, pilots are banned from breaking the sound barrier over land. You can do it over the sea, he says, but you cant do it over the land. Its one of the things that the Concorde project suffered from because as Concorde was developed the rules changed which meant it could only break the sound barrier over water.\nThe shock waves are the physical effects of the aircraft travelling so fast through air, especially if its moist and warm, and affecting the air around it\nMoreover, capturing the shockwaves created when an aircraft passes the speed of sound are incredibly difficult  theyre much harder to pick up with the naked eye. You need special kit in order to see it. When photographing aerodynamic models being subjected to supersonic speeds in wind tunnels, scientists usually use mirrors to pick up the difference in light refraction from the resulting shockwaves. The resultant Schlieren photograph is then used to visualise the system of shockwaves around the wind tunnel model. In wind tunnel tests the models dont tend to create the same kind of vapour cones because the air is treated to take the moisture out of the air.\nThe vapour cones are created by a shockwave that is generated by the aircraft as it picks up speed. The shock waves are the physical effects of the aircraft travelling so fast through air. As the aircraft picks up speed, and approaches the speed of sound  around 767mph (1,234km/h) at sea level  shockwaves form around the aircraft. Across these shockwaves there is discontinuity in the local air pressure and temperature. This causes the air to lose its capacity to hold water and condensation starts to form, creating the vapour cone.\nIf you see a vapour cone, youve got a shockwave, because youve got a change in pressure and temperature, says Irvine.\nMany of the best pictures of this phenomenon feature aircraft flown by the US Navy; no accident, given that the warm, moist air close to the surface of the sea can help amplify the effect.\nIts a trick commonly performed by F-A/18 Hornet fighter-bombers, the mainstay of the US Navys carrier fleets. The Hornet is also used by the Blue Angels aerobatic team, and these pilots are adept at performing manoeuvres that creates these vapour cones  also known as shock collars or shock eggs. Moreover, theyre often done next to an aircraft carrier or out to sea, with trained US Navy photographers close to hand  taking a split-second picture of a jet travelling at 600mph (960km/h) is not something youre likely to capture in crystal-clear detail on your smartphone.\nThe air travelling around the wing can accelerate  and that can break the sound barrier  Rod Irvine\nJust to make things more complicated, the vapour cones are often the most dramatic when they take place in whats called transonic flight  thats when some of the air flowing around the aircraft is flowing at above the speed of sound, and some of it below.\nUltimately, he says, you need to have the right climactic conditions  the kind of warm moist air that aircraft operating off carriers can find easier than most. Then, get a nearby cameraman who really knows what theyre doing and voila  youve captured, on camera, the dramatic vapour cloud that so many of us think is the split-second spectacle of a sonic boom.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called If You Only Read 6 Things This Week.

While it mentions F-18 Hornets and their ability to create vapor cones, which are often mistaken for sonic booms, it does not directly support the claim that a video shows an F-18 breaking the sound barrier and creating a sonic boom.  The article explicitly states that vapor cones are often seen at speeds *below* the sound barrier and that capturing actual sonic booms is difficult.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation expresses high confidence (score 10) that the image depicts an F-18 Super Hornet seemingly breaking the sound barrier due to the visible condensation cloud.  However, the external validation (score 3) contradicts this, citing a source that explains the difference between vapor cones (often mistaken for sonic booms) and actual sonic booms.  The source emphasizes that vapor cones can occur at subsonic speeds, and capturing a visual of a true sonic boom is exceptionally difficult.  The discrepancy stems from the fact that the condensation cloud in the image is more consistent with a vapor cone than a shockwave associated with a sonic boom.  While the image shows an F-18, and a condensation cloud is present, this cloud doesn't definitively prove supersonic flight.  The external source casts doubt on the caption's assertion of a sonic boom, highlighting the visual challenges in capturing sonic booms and the common misinterpretation of vapor cones as evidence of supersonic speeds. The low confidence score reflects the significant difference in opinion between the internal and external checks.  There is no conclusive evidence that the image depicts the aircraft breaking the sound barrier and generating a sonic boom; hence, labeling it as 'out of context' is appropriate, but only with moderate certainty. Visual analysis alone is insufficient to reach a definitive conclusion without corroborating evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation contradicts it, emphasizing the difficulty in visually capturing sonic booms and the likelihood of misinterpreting vapor cones as sonic booms.  The significant discrepancy lowers overall confidence."

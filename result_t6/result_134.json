        "content": "US President Donald Trump has defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nAfter face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Trump contradicted US intelligence agencies and said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote.\nMr Putin reiterated that Russia had never interfered in US affairs.\nThe two men held nearly two hours of closed-door talks in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday.\nAt a news conference after the summit, President Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to the allegations of meddling in the elections.\n\"President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,\" he replied.\nUS intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scale of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media.\nWhat has US reaction been?\nIn a strongly-worded statement, US House Speaker Paul Ryan said Mr Trump \"must appreciate that Russia is not our ally\".\n\"There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals,\" he said, adding that there was \"no question\" Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election.\nSenior Republican Senator John McCain said it was a \"disgraceful performance\" by a US president.\n\"No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant,\" Mr McCain said in a statement.\nAnother senior Republican, Senator Lindsey Graham, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tweeted that it was a \"missed opportunity... to firmly hold Russia accountable for 2016 meddling\".\nIn a series of tweets, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump's actions had \"strengthened our adversaries while weakening our defences and those of our allies\".\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

He visibly seemed happier with Mr Putin's assurances than he did with the evidence of his own intelligence agencies. And he even welcomed Mr Putin's suggestion that Russia could join the investigation and interview the alleged perpetrators itself! Washington's Nato allies and many seasoned observers on Capitol Hill must have been watching in horror.\nMr Putin described the Helsinki meeting as \"candid and useful\" while Mr Trump said there had been \"deeply productive dialogue\".\nMr Trump said US-Russia relations had \"never been worse\" than before they met, but that had now changed.\nRelations between Russia and the West were severely strained by Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which President Putin acknowledged in the news conference.\n\"President Trump's position on Crimea is well known. He talks about the illegality of the Crimean reintegration to Russia. We have another point of view... that a referendum was held in accordance with international law. For us, it's a closed question,\" he said.",

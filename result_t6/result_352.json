While the image is of Eminem, it does not provide evidence about when or if he was diagnosed with coronavirus.

While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem's health quickly registered here at Snopes.\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem's lyrics. We're not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere's how this joke appeared on the \"Dad Jokes\" section of Reddit:\n\"In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

The external check definitively refutes the caption's claim, citing a Snopes article that debunks it as a false rumor.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks that the caption is inaccurate. The image shows Eminem, but provides no information about his health status. The external evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context and false.  The confidence score is high because both internal and external validation methods converge on the same conclusion, and the external evidence is a reputable source.",

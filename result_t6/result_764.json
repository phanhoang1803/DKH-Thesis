Hodas posted the video to Instagram (with tags such as #3D, #photoshop, #render, and #animation), and provided extra insight into how the video was created in response to a query on Facebook:\npretty much! depends on what I need. In this case I layered few planes with wm maps on top of each other and added a lot of zdepth fog to blend it in.\nNo records of volcanos emitting bright pink smoke exist, except those created by digital artists.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The claim that the image depicts an \"actual 'pink volcano' erupting in New Zealand\" is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  The internal analysis reveals a lack of visual evidence supporting this claim. The image shows a pink and purple smoke plume, which is not consistent with volcanic eruptions.  Furthermore, there's no contextual information within the image itself to suggest a location in New Zealand or a volcanic event. The internal assessment concludes the caption is inaccurate.\n\nThe external validation strengthens this conclusion significantly.  A reputable fact-checking website, Snopes.com, definitively debunks this claim.  Snopes confirms that the video (presumably related to the still image) showing a pink volcanic eruption is digitally manipulated.  Crucially, Snopes states that there is no record of naturally occurring volcanic eruptions producing bright pink smoke.  They explicitly attribute the video to the work of an artist, Filip Hodas, and its origin in 2016.  The external evidence provides strong corroboration and eliminates any reasonable doubt about the caption's accuracy.\n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. Both indicate that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence against the claim. The image itself does not show a volcano, and external fact-checking sources definitively prove that the video associated with this claim is digitally altered and not a real event. No ambiguities or discrepancies exist between internal analysis and external verification; both processes confirm the caption's inaccuracy. The visual evidence aligns with the findings of the external sources. The pink cloud formation in the image lacks the characteristics of a volcanic eruption. The absence of any geological features typically associated with a volcanic eruption in the image further supports the conclusion that the caption misrepresents the image's content. No further investigation or clarification is needed. The caption is demonstrably out of context and factually incorrect.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The image does not show a volcanic eruption, and reputable sources confirm the claim is based on a digitally manipulated video."

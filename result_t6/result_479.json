        "content": "Satellite images taken by a US firm of a large Russian military convoy near Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, show it has \"largely dispersed and redeployed\".\nThe convoy was last seen near Antonov Airport, north-west of Kyiv, and its movement could signal a renewed push towards the city.\nThe firm that took the photos, Maxar Technologies, said parts of the convoy were in positions in surrounding towns.\nOther parts are further north, with artillery now in firing positions.\nThe apparent redeployment came as Russian forces in Ukraine began attacking new targets in different areas of the country:\nAn airfield and jet engine factory were targeted in Lutsk, in the north-west\nExplosions also hit airfields at Ivano-Frankivsk, in the south-west, according to Russian defence officials\nIn Dnipro, a major stronghold in central eastern Ukraine, one person was reported dead in air strikes\nSafe haven no more\nSarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent, Dnipro\nThe air raid sirens went off at 04:30 and wailed for more than three hours. We now know the danger was real.\nOfficials here say there were three air strikes, hitting a small shoe factory, an apartment block and a kindergarten.\nThis city is full of heavy industry, including a rocket factory. There is a metalworks nearby the site that was hit, but no obvious military target.\nDnipro has been bracing for this since the war began. All the bridges and main roads here are heavily guarded. Residents have got used to scrambling to underground shelters when the sirens sound.\nEven so, the city has been something of a safe haven, for people fleeing cities under sustained Russian attack. In the past few days, residents here had begun leaving: we saw giant queues for evacuation trains and the roads west out of town have been heavily congested. Now the city has been directly hit, I suspect more will be thinking of getting out.\n\"Ukrainian big cities are again subjected to devastating blows,\" said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak.\nHe added that the shelling in Lutsk had shut down two central heating compounds.\n\"Russia's destructive war against civilians and major cities continues,\" he said.\nRussian state media reported that the Ukrainian city of Volnovakha had been captured by Russian-backed separatist forces.\nThere is no independent confirmation of the capture of the city, which is a northern gateway to the besieged port city of Mariupol.\nWar in Ukraine: More coverage\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Russian claims that chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction were developed in Ukraine. In a video address, he also warned that Russia would get \"the most severe sanctions response\" if it were to use such weapons against Ukraine.\nThe US said earlier that Russia's claims of Ukraine hosting US-backed chemical weapons facilities was a \"false flag\", intended to justify Russia's possible use of such weapons.\nRussia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday to discuss the alleged manufacture of biological weapons in Ukraine.\nConvoy redeploys around Kyiv\nRussian forces moved three miles (5km) closer to Kyiv in the past 24 hours, a senior US defence official said on Thursday.\nThat meant Russian troops advancing from the north-west were now just nine miles from the city centre, the official - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told reporters.\nRussian forces were also trying to close in on the city from the north-east, and were now about 25 miles (40km) away, the official said.\nThe northern city of Chernihiv was now \"isolated\" the official added.\nThe convoy was earlier seen stalled not far from the capital, where US officials said it was targeted by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles. It is not clear how many of the vehicles currently seen on the move may have been an initial part of that first group.\nFierce battles have been raging in recent days in Irpin and Bucha, satellite towns just a few kilometres north-west of Kyiv. Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes.\nOn Thursday, footage emerged apparently showing a Russian military column being hit by Ukrainian forces near the city of Brovary, just outside the capital.\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko says that half the population of the city of about three million has already fled, adding that Kyiv \"has been transformed into a fortress\".\n\"Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,\" the mayor said.\nTens of thousands of civilians have formed Territorial Defence units to help the Ukrainian armed forces defend the capital.\nWar in Ukraine: More coverage\nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question or comment or you can email us at HaveYourSay@bbc.co.uk.

    "explanation": "The internal validation gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows a snowy scene in what appears to be a residential area in Kyiv, Ukraine.  The caption's mention of \"heavy snow\" and the location align with the visual content, making it internally consistent.  However, the external validation provides a low confidence score (3) and contradicts this internal assessment. The external check states that there's no mention of heavy snow in Kyiv or Europe in available news reports around the time the image was likely taken, suggesting the caption's claim of heavy snow affecting the area is unsupported by external sources. This significant discrepancy reduces the overall confidence. The external validation is more reliable in this case because it checks against verifiable external sources (news reports), whereas internal validation only assesses the consistency between the image and the caption. Since the external validation casts doubt on the key element of \"heavy snow,\" the caption is deemed out of context. The visual evidence, although consistent with a snowy scene in Kyiv, doesn't definitively prove the presence of unusually heavy snowfall, especially given the absence of such reports in relevant news. Therefore, we cannot definitively confirm whether the snow depicted is unusually heavy as the caption claims.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the caption's claim of snow in Kyiv, but external validation contradicts the claim of unusually heavy snow, leading to an out-of-context assessment."

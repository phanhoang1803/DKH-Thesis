        "content": "Claim:\nRush Limbaugh's final net worth was revealed and it left his family in tears.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nRush Limbaugh's net worth was the subject of an online advertisement following his death on Feb. 17, 2021. The conservative radio personality died after battling lung cancer.\nThe ad in question featured a photograph of Limbaugh and read: \"[Photos] Rush Limbaugh's Final Net Worth Left His Family In Tears.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a slideshow article with 254 pages. Each page featured a celebrity and his or her purported net worth.\nWe clicked through the entire story. It wasn't surprising to us that Limbaugh never showed up on any of the 254 pages. The article didn't mention his name even once. The ad was nothing more than clickbait.\nAside from the ad, the article seemed less than trustworthy. For example, Parker Schnabel of the \"Gold Rush\" reality TV series was featured on three different pages. Two pages claimed he was worth $8 million, while a third page said the figure was $10 million.\nAccording to the story, former TV news personality Megyn Kelly was purportedly worth both $30 million and $55 million at the same time, an incredible feat.\nNear the end of the story, actress Milana Vayntrub was featured on page 250. She is best known in her role as Lily Adams on AT&T television commercials and has been featured in the past in misleading advertisements.\nThe final page featured Monica Lewinsky, who previously was the target of a similar ad.\nAside from lengthy articles like this one, some readers might often find net worth dollar figures that appear above Google searches. While these might be interesting for discussion, there's perhaps little data behind those numbers to support their accuracy.\nAs for Limbaugh's actual net worth, the real figure was not made public. A number of websites have mentioned an amount of around $600 million. However, several of those websites all cited the same source for the figure. That single source only publishes estimates.\nIn sum, Limbaugh's net worth did not leave his family in tears. We've seen the same \"net worth left his family in tears\" trope for former \"Jeopardy\" host Alex Trebek and a number of other celebrities. All of those stories have been rated \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that Rush Limbaugh's final net worth was revealed and caused his family to cry.  Both internal and external validation checks strongly contradict this claim.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe image shows Donald Trump and another man. Rush Limbaugh is absent.  The internal check correctly identifies this discrepancy and assigns a confidence score of 0, indicating a complete mismatch between the caption and the image content. The explanation clearly states that the entities (people mentioned) are incorrect.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check uses Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, to verify the claim. Snopes definitively rates the claim as \"False.\"  Its detailed explanation traces the origin of the claim to misleading online advertisements and clickbait articles that lacked verifiable information about Limbaugh's net worth or its impact on his family.  Snopes' conclusion is that the actual net worth was never publicly revealed and the claim is a false, recurring trope. The high confidence score of 10 reflects Snopes' strong evidence and thorough investigation.\n\nAgreement and Discrepancy Analysis:\nThere is complete agreement between internal and external checks. Both independently determine that the caption is false and out of context. There is no discrepancy. The internal check focuses on the lack of visual evidence of Limbaugh in the image, while the external check provides strong evidence from a reliable source debunking the entire claim.\n\nVisual Analysis:\nThe image clearly shows two individuals who are not Rush Limbaugh.  There is no visual evidence to support the caption's claim in any way.  The image's context is unrelated to the caption's subject.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on a lack of visual evidence and definitive external evidence from Snopes, the caption is definitively out of context. The high confidence score reflects the certainty of the result.  The analysis shows a clear and consistent picture: the caption's claim is false and does not relate to the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks independently confirm that the caption is completely out of context. The image shows Donald Trump and another man, not Rush Limbaugh. External fact-checking by Snopes definitively debunks the caption's claim about Limbaugh's net worth."

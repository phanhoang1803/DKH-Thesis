        "content": "Claim:\nViral text accurately outlines how biotechnology company Moderna is linked to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeffrey Epstein.\nIn mid-2020, the American biotechnology company Moderna received prominent news coverage about their efforts to develop a vaccine to deal with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nAt that time, internet users were circulating a bit of text tying Moderna to infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Hungarian-born financier George Soros, and American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, figures who previously had all been the subjects of various baseless conspiracy theories.\nThe text linking Moderna with all of these public figures and implying they were involved in some nebulous but nefarious plot appeared to have been a completely tongue-in-cheek spoof of groundless conspiracy theories, but many readers who skimmed it at least wondered if it might have at least some substance to it:\nThe vaccine that is coming...\nAs many of you heard Moderna is in stage 3 of their vaccine testing.\nIf all goes well it'll become federal law to get the vaccine.\nHere's something many of you don't know,\nguess who the first CEO of Moderna was?\nA Cornell graduate by the name of Anthony Fauci, who was a roommate with none other than\nBill Gates.\nAre you paying attention?\nIt was at Cornell that Bill Gates designed the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patented it under US2006257852.\nAre you awake yet?\nNow let's really go down the rabbit hole.\nModerna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben.\nIG Farben is infamous for it's mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust.\nAfter Germany fell, IG Farben was dissolved and its assets sold off by a Nazi turned American by the name of, you guessed it, George Soros.\nSoros rebranded the company as Moderna.\nAnd who was the primary stockholder of Moderna until his death?\nJeffrey Epstein.\nHis role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections.\nLet that sink in.\nWake up people!\nYou are being conditioned and controlled.\nFor the \"Is this true?\" record, we note the following:\n1) Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has never been the CEO of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna. Fauci has been the director of NIAID since 1984, while ModeRNA Therapeutics was not founded until 2010. Fauci also graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1966 and therefore could not possibly have been college roommates with technology mogul Bill Gates, who attended Harvard College for a few years in the mid-1970s.\n2) Bill Gates, who did not attend Cornell, also did not design or patent radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips. The first such patent was taken out in 1973 by Mario Cardullo, and the patent number provided in the message text (US2006257852) actually points to a patent related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus rather than any RFID technology.\n3) Notorious chemical and pharmaceutical company IG Farben was not \"dissolved\" after World War II by George Soros, who was not a Nazi (or a German) and was only 14 years old when Germany surrendered in 1945. The victorious Allied powers seized IG Farben's surviving assets and split the firm up into smaller constituent companies.\n4) Financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex offenses in 2008 and committed suicide in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, got his start in the world of finance as a trader at Bear Stearns in 1976 and later founded his own money-management consulting firm, Financial Trust Company.",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects the core claim of the conspiracy theory debunked in the provided Snopes article.  The article explicitly states that a viral text message linked Moderna to Fauci, Gates, Soros, and Epstein, implying a nefarious plot. The caption mirrors this core element. While the article refutes the claims, the caption's description of the conspiracy theory itself is accurate.",
      "supporting_points": "The text linking Moderna with all of these public figures and implying they were involved in some nebulous but nefarious plot appeared to have been a completely tongue-in-cheek spoof of groundless conspiracy theories, but many readers who skimmed it at least wondered if it might have at least some substance to it.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the image's content, correctly noting the absence of the individuals mentioned in the caption.  The internal check gives a low confidence score (10) and a verdict of False because the image only shows the Moderna logo and doesn't depict the individuals. This is a valid observation based on the image alone.\n\nThe external check, however, focuses on the accuracy of the caption in representing a specific conspiracy theory. It confirms that the caption accurately reflects a claim made within a conspiracy theory which linked Moderna to various public figures, implying a nefarious plot. The external check gives a higher confidence score (8) and a verdict of True, because it correctly identifies the caption as a description of a real-world conspiracy theory. \n\nThe discrepancy arises because the internal check assesses the caption's relation to the image content, while the external check evaluates the caption's accuracy in describing a known conspiracy theory. The image provides no visual evidence to support or refute the conspiracy theory. Therefore, the caption is out-of-context regarding the image but accurately describes a real-world event.  The higher confidence score from the external validation is chosen since the external source provided context about the caption's meaning, something the image itself could not provide.\n\nIn summary: The caption is out-of-context concerning the provided image because the image only contains the Moderna logo. However, the caption accurately reflects a specific conspiracy theory connecting Moderna to several public figures. The internal check assesses the image's visual content, while the external check analyzes the caption's connection to a larger context. The external validation is prioritized because the caption's accuracy was validated through an external source.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the caption out of context based on the image, while external check validates the caption's accuracy in representing a known conspiracy theory.  The external source's context leads to an overall OOC verdict."

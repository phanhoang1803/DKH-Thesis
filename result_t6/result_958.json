While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as \"making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,\" this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton's impeachment.\nThis tweet does not appear on Lewinsky's official Twitter timeline. We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well.\nWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted.\nThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with \"Twitter for Android.\" Lewinksy's tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone.",

        "content": "Amid the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, a screenshot of a salacious fake tweet attributed to Monica Lewinsky is circulating on Facebook.\nThe fabricated tweet makes it appear that Lewinsky, a central figure in the 1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice and lying under oath, made a sexually suggestive comment involving Trump, oral sex and her interest in seeing Trump impeached. Clintons impeachment charge stemmed from a sexual harassment case, in which Lewinsky, then a White House intern, became famously intertwined following an independent councils investigation into sexual encounters between Lewinsky and Clinton.\nThe viral image in question displays Lewinskys real Twitter profile picture and handle. It makes it look like she authored a tweet time-stamped at 6:06 p.m. on Oct. 3, with 1,610 retweets and over 18,000 likes, that read:\n\"Im willing to take one for (sic) team and give Trump a b****** in the oval office. Apparently, thats the only thing that can convince Republicans to impeach.\"\nThe screenshot was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNo, this is not a real tweet written by Monica Lewinsky.\nThe fake tweet appears to have been created by Instagram user @electorotting  the handle appears in the upper right hand corner of the tweets image. A visit to that Instagram profile shows the Lewinsky tweet and several other fabricated tweets and other memes. The same persons Twitter bio tells people to follow them on Instagram for \"original memes.\" In 2018, the user admitted to the Associated Press that he was responsible for creating a fake tweet made to look like it came from President Barack Obamas verified account.\nPolitiFact reached out to @electorotting but didnt immediately receive a response.\nThere is no sign of the tweet on Lewinskys Twitter profile page. She tweeted multiple times on Oct. 3, but none mentioned impeachment or anything sexually suggestive.\nWe also searched Lewinskys Twitter handle @MonicaLewinsky in the All My Tweets database, which compiles users tweets in a single webpage, and could not find anything from Lewinsky on Oct. 3  as the screenshot shows  that references impeachment, Trump or oral sex.\nAnother red flag demonstrating that the tweet is fabricated: An advanced Twitter search of its keywords came up with (almost) no results. For a viral tweet that has supposedly garnered thousands of retweets and likes, only one similarly-worded tweet from a user who isnt Lewinsky showed up on the platform.\nWe reached out to Lewinsky for comment, but havent yet heard back.\nWe know enough, though, to rate this faux tweet Pants on Fire!",

      "explanation": "Both sources explicitly state that the claim is false.  Source 1, from Snopes, shows that the supposed tweet is not genuine and does not appear on Lewinsky's Twitter timeline. Source 2, from PolitiFact, similarly concludes that the tweet is fabricated and provides further evidence that it originated from a meme account known for creating fake tweets.  Neither source finds any evidence to support the claim in the news caption.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check points out the lack of visual evidence in the image to support the claim made in the caption. The image is simply a portrait of Monica Lewinsky, and there is nothing to suggest any action related to President Trump's impeachment. The external check provides strong evidence from Snopes and PolitiFact, both reputable fact-checking websites, to debunk the claim. These sources demonstrate that the supposed tweet mentioning Lewinsky's offer to \"take one for the team\" is fabricated and not authentic. The high confidence score from the external check (10) reinforces the reliability of the information. Since both internal and external validation methods confirm the falsity of the claim and its misrepresentation of the visual content, the final verdict is that the caption is definitively out of context. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both methods independently conclude that the claim is false and not supported by evidence. The confidence score is high (10) because of the consistency and strength of evidence from both internal and external validation, and the lack of any contradicting information.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks conclusively determine that the caption is out of context. The image shows only a portrait of Monica Lewinsky, while the caption makes a false claim about her actions related to President Trump's impeachment.  Fact-checking websites confirm the fabricated nature of the claim."

It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that backless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016.  Internal validation finds no evidence in the image to support this claim. The image depicts a child in a car seat, but provides no information about backless boosters or any specific legislation. The internal check thus concludes that the caption is not supported by the image, with a confidence score of 0.  External validation, however, provides strong evidence refuting the caption's claim.  External sources, specifically a fact-checking website like Snopes, definitively state that the claim of a US ban on backless boosters in December 2016 is false. This claim originated from a social media meme and was inaccurate regarding both the location (it was related to UK legislation) and the nature of the legislation (it affected manufacturers, not users).  The external check has a confidence score of 10, completely refuting the caption's claim. Given the complete disagreement between the image and the caption's claim, and the strong external evidence refuting the claim, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check outweighs the 0 confidence from the internal check. The image provides no support for the caption's claim, and independent fact-checking resources confirm the inaccuracy of the claim itself.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds no image evidence supporting the caption's claim. External validation strongly refutes the claim, showing it originated from a false social media meme. There is a complete lack of visual or contextual support for the claim within the image, and independent fact-checking sources corroborate this, concluding that the caption is out of context."

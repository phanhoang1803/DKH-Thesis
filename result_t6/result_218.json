        "content": "Claim:\nA single eruption from a volcano puts 10,000 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of human activity has throughout history.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nThe myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate.\nIn a 2009 editorial written for Australias ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: \"Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.\"\nThis brief statement  a mere 28 words  yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic cough? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimers second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality.\nThat useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere.\nAs CO2, in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate  a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus.\nThe erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimers statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center:\nAccording to Houghton and Hackler, land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.\nThe 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2.\nA more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes, as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year (note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO2 not solely the carbon component):\n[CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]:\nUsing the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2.\n[CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]:\nExtrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr.\n[CO2 from other volcanic sources]:\nPerez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr.\nWhile the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year:\nThe global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr.\nOnce again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimers claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic cough from a single volcano to, by itself, increase Earths annual volcanic CO2 flux by a factor of 65.\nAbsurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way:\nThere is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours.\nHowever, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes directly addresses and debunks the claim made in the news caption.  Snopes rates the claim as \"False\" and presents evidence showing that the amount of CO2 released by a single volcanic eruption is far less than the total CO2 emitted by human activity throughout history.  The Snopes article uses various data sources and calculations to support its conclusion. Therefore the verdict is false.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that a single volcanic eruption releases 10,000 times more carbon dioxide than all human activity throughout history. This claim is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation. \n\nInternal validation reveals that the image, while depicting a volcanic eruption, provides no quantitative data on the CO2 emissions from this specific event.  Therefore, the image alone cannot support or refute the caption's claim. The internal check correctly flags this limitation, assigning a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False.\n\nExternal validation, however, provides strong evidence to contradict the caption's assertion.  The external check uses a reputable source (Snopes, likely) to establish that the claim is false. This source presents a detailed analysis demonstrating that human activities have released far greater amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere than any single volcanic eruption. The high confidence score of 10 and the verdict of False from the external check strongly support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate.\n\nThe discrepancy between the internal and external checks lies in their scope.  The internal check focuses solely on the image's content, rightly recognizing its limitations in verifying the numerical claim. The external check, on the other hand, draws upon broader scientific consensus and data to refute the caption's assertion. This difference in approach is not a conflict but rather a complement. The internal check highlights the image's lack of relevant information, while the external check provides robust evidence from independent sources to assess the claim's validity. \n\nCombining both checks, it's clear that the caption is out of context (OOC). The image visually depicts a volcanic eruption, but this visual evidence alone is insufficient to support the quantitative claim made in the caption. The external evidence decisively refutes the claim, highlighting the gross inaccuracy of the statement regarding the relative CO2 output of volcanoes versus human activities.\n\nIn conclusion,  the caption's statement is false and out of context. The external validation, backed by credible data and analysis, significantly outweighs the limitations of the image's internal analysis. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strength of the external evidence in refuting the caption's claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods agree that the caption's claim is false. The internal check highlights the image's inability to support the quantitative claim, while the external check uses reliable sources to demonstrate the inaccuracy of the statement about volcanic CO2 emissions compared to human activity.  The strong external evidence leads to a high confidence in concluding that the caption is out of context."

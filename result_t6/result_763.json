        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows former child star Amanda Bynes working in product support.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nFormer child actress Amanda Bynes has been featured in misleading clickbait advertisements for several years, whether they were about her former work in the movie industry, what she was doing now, or a purported new job.\nFor example, a freeze-frame from a scene in the 2006 feature film \"She's the Man\" was displayed in countless ads. In the scene, Bynes lifts her shirt to prove she's a woman. Her character spent much of the movie pretending to be a boy so that she could play soccer. However, she did not appear topless in the film, despite what was implied by various ads. One ad claimed: \"[Photos] Top 17 Most Paused Movie Moments.\"\nIn January 2021, another online advertisement included the same moment from \"She's the Man.\" It also featured a second picture of Amanda Bynes purportedly now \"working 9-5\" in a product support job. The ad claimed: \"She Was A Super Star, Now She's Working 9-5.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a lengthy slideshow article on Gazillions.com. Its headline read: \"Former Stars Who Now Have Normal Jobs.\" Like the ad with the pictures of Bynes, the page for also said that she worked a job in \"product support.\" The description on the page claimed that she \"returned to work in the support industry.\"\nThis ad and story were both misleading. The photograph was real. It's also true that her mechanic-style shirt said \"Willie Product Support.\" However, the picture of Amanda Bynes did not show a her \"now\" working a new job \"9-5.\" The shirt simply seemed to be a style choice. It may also have been a joke based on the supposed company name. Also, the person's name on the shirt said \"Rich.\"\nA story from Us Weekly included the same picture with this caption: \"Amanda Bynes leaves a nail salon on October 10, 2019.\" Several other photographs from the same day were also published by In Touch Weekly.\nBynes was perhaps best known for her work in the 2003 film \"What a Girl Wants.\" She also appeared in \"Hairspray,\" \"Easy A,\" and \"Big Fat Liar.\" The former child star got her start on the wildly popular 1990s Nickelodeon television series \"All That,\" as well as \"The Amanda Show.\"",

While a photo exists of Bynes wearing a shirt that says \"Willie Product Support,\" Snopes debunks the claim that this image shows her working a 9-to-5 job.  The article states the image is misleading and the shirt was likely a stylistic choice or a joke. Therefore, the news caption is false.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that the image depicts former child star Amanda Bynes working in product support. Both internal and external checks strongly contradict this claim.\n\nInternal validation reveals a significant discrepancy. The image shows a young woman who bears no resemblance to Amanda Bynes. This visual mismatch immediately casts doubt on the caption's accuracy. The internal check assigns a confidence score of 0, indicating a complete lack of visual agreement between the image and the caption.\n\nExternal validation further strengthens this assessment. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, directly addresses the claim that the image shows Amanda Bynes working in product support. Snopes concludes that the claim is false and the image is misleading.  The article cites that while a photo exists of Bynes wearing a shirt that says \"Willie Product Support,\" this does not indicate she is employed in that capacity. The image is likely a stylistic choice or a joke, and the context provided by the caption is entirely fabricated. Snopes assigns a high confidence score of 8 to this finding, confirming the misinformation presented in the original caption.\n\nThere is no disagreement between the internal and external checks. Both methods independently confirm that the caption is out of context. The image does not depict Amanda Bynes in a product support role; neither the facial features nor the overall context support the caption's claim. The high confidence score from the external validation (8) and the complete lack of confidence from internal validation (0) contribute to the overall high confidence score of 9 for the final assessment.  The combination of visual mismatch and authoritative external debunking decisively proves the caption to be false and out of context.",

        "content": "A popular pro-Donald Trump Twitter account cast blame for family separations at the border on former Democratic presidents of decades past.\n\"Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America. And liberals cheered,\" Education for Liberals tweeted. \"(Barack) Obama enforced this same law throughout his entire presidency. And liberals cheered. President Trump is now left to deal with it. And liberals are angry.\"\nWeve previously compared the practices of Trump and Obama when it came to separating families.\nDid Clinton pass a law that separated children from their parents?\nThe Twitter user did not respond to multiple requests for comment. We found two major policies relating to immigration that went into effect during the Clinton administration, but neither did what the tweets said.\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\nClinton signed an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration in 1996. But it had no provisions mandating the separation of families, experts told us.\nThe biggest change the legislation brought about for families was deporting immigrants who were once legally in the United States but now subject to deportation because of a criminal conviction.\n\"The 1996 reforms made it easier to remove previously legal immigrants (many of whom had married, settled down, and had kids in the United States) for criminal conviction that had previously not made them eligible for removal,\" said Rick Su, an immigration law professor at University of Buffalo.\n\"Adult noncitizens who were removed sometimes chose to have U.S. citizen kids remain in the United States,\" said Peter Marguiles, law professor at Roger Williams University. \"But that was a choice made by parents, not a decision by the government.\"\nThe Trump administrations zero-tolerance policy that has resulted in family separations doesnt stem from the enforcement of this law, however, but entry without inspection, which had been on the books for decades prior to 1996, Adam Cox, immigration law professor at NYU, told us.\nDespite the law on the books, immigrants entering the country illegally as families were rarely criminally prosecuted before the Trump administration. Immigrants with criminal records or illegally re-entering the country were prioritized for prosecution during more recent administrations.\nOf late, however, the government has cracked down on parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission, prosecuting all illegal border crossings.\nChildren cant go to detention centers, so they are being handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services. (More on this later.)\nTo sum it up: The 1996 law didnt require, nor did the Clinton administration adopt, a zero tolerance policy requiring that all noncitizens crossing the border in violation of immigration law be prosecuted for federal crimes. Thats a new policy under Trump.\nThe Flores settlement\nThe tweet may also have been referring to a 1997 agreement conservatives have used to justify family separations.\nThe Flores settlement was a January 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department. The agreement determined immigrant children must be held in the \"least restrictive setting.\"\nThe Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but it doesnt condone or require the separation of children from parents. In fact, it stresses keeping children close to parents and extended family.\nThe Obama administration had been placing children with their parents in family detention centers, but the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 held that the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. Because the detention centers were considered restrictive, the children had to be released. The Obama administration chose to release parents alongside their children.\nThe result of these actions left the Trump administration with three options when apprehending a family trying to cross the border illegally: release parents and their children; send parents to prison and release their children; or send parents to prison and their children to child detention facilities overseen by the government.\nThe Trump administration chose the last option, a decision he reversed on June 20, 2018.\nOur ruling\nA tweet by Education4Liberals tried to point out liberal hypocrisy toward immigrant family separations, saying \"Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America.\"\nThere is no law separating children from their parents when they enter the country illegally. The Trump administration chose to pursue that outcome as a result of its zero-tolerance policy.\nClinton signed a significant immigration crackdown into law, but it mostly related to immigrants who were already living in the United States with criminal convictions, indirectly impacting some immigrant children.\nThe Flores agreement of 1997 mandated that unaccompanied children be placed in the least restrictive setting while awaiting an immigration hearing, but that allows for a few options so that children are not required to be separated from their parents.\nWe rate this statement False.",

It does not provide any information about undocumented immigrant families being dropped off at a bus station in McAllen, Texas in July.

    "explanation": "The provided caption states that undocumented immigrant families were dropped off in July at a bus station in McAllen, Texas, after being released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  The image shows a group of families walking on a street. While the image depicts families who may be undocumented immigrants, there is no visual evidence to confirm this.  More importantly, there is no visual evidence supporting the claim that they were dropped off by ICE at a bus station in McAllen, Texas, in July. The image lacks any identifying features such as location markers, bus stations, or ICE vehicles that would confirm the caption's specifics. The internal validation correctly identifies this lack of visual evidence, assigning a low confidence score because the image does not visually support the details mentioned in the caption. The external validation further weakens the claim, finding the provided sources irrelevant to the stated context.  The external sources fail to provide any information that corroborates or refutes the specific claim in the caption.  The absence of supporting evidence, both visually and through external sources, leads to a low confidence score and supports the conclusion that the caption is likely out of context. There is no information to suggest image manipulation or miscontextualization, but the lack of evidence makes it impossible to confirm or deny the events described in the caption with certainty. The image may depict a group of families who are undocumented immigrants, but the claim regarding their release by ICE at a bus station in McAllen, Texas in July is not supported. Given the insufficient evidence, a conservative assessment is to flag the caption as out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations agree that the image does not provide sufficient evidence to support the details in the caption. The internal validation highlights the lack of visual cues supporting the caption's claims, while the external validation notes the irrelevance of the provided sources.  The lack of supporting information leads to a low confidence assessment and the conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

Murray, who left public life a few years ago to pursue a more conservative lifestyle, found out he was dying about three months ago but decided not to make a big deal out of it.\nAccording to his spokesman and lawyer, Art Tubolls, Murray left very simple instructions for his passing:\nBill wanted to see America unite under President Trump and come together to fight against all the things hes fought against his entire career. When he wrote the movie Ghostbusters he used Slimer as an example of how feeding something causes dependence. Stripes was to teach the average American that anyone can be a hero if the timing is right.\nNone of this was true: at the time this report was published, Bill Murray was still very much alive and only 68 years old. The report of his death was another fabrication by Conservative Tears, a site which is part of the America's Last Line of Defense network of websites and Facebook pages that pump out a steady stream of inflammatory and politically divisive misinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"",

Snopes identifies the claim as a fabrication from the Conservative Tears website, which is known for spreading misinformation.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check correctly identifies Bill Murray in the image and notes the caption's mention of his death in 2019.  However, it acknowledges the need for external verification regarding the claim of his death and political views. The external validation check decisively refutes the caption's claim. Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, confirms that the claim is false and originates from a known misinformation source.  The discrepancy lies in the caption's factual inaccuracy regarding Bill Murray's death and his supposed political statement. The internal check focuses on image content and caption consistency, while the external check provides definitive evidence contradicting the caption's core narrative.  The visual evidence shows Bill Murray in an image suitable for a memorial, which aligns with the caption's implication of his death. However, this is not enough to confirm the caption's false claims about the circumstances of his death and his political views. The high confidence score reflects the strong external evidence disproving the claim. The internal analysis merely confirms the presence of Bill Murray in the image and partially matches the caption's temporal element, but it doesn't independently verify the death claim or the associated political statement. The combination of internal consistency regarding Bill Murray's presence in the image and the definitive external refutation of the core narrative leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds partial consistency but highlights the need for external verification. External validation definitively refutes the caption's claim about Bill Murray's death and political statement, resulting in a high confidence score for the 'out of context' verdict."

Hodas posted the video to Instagram (with tags such as #3D, #photoshop, #render, and #animation), and provided extra insight into how the video was created in response to a query on Facebook:\npretty much! depends on what I need.

    "explanation": "The news caption claiming a video shows a pink volcano erupting in New Zealand is definitively false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal analysis reveals a significant discrepancy between the caption and the image. The image shows a vibrant pink and purple cloud of smoke, lacking any geological features associated with a volcanic eruption. There is no visible landscape, geological formations, or context that would support a claim of a volcanic eruption in New Zealand.  The lack of visual evidence of a volcanic event completely contradicts the caption's claim.  This internal inconsistency raises serious doubts about the accuracy of the original caption. The external validation strongly supports this conclusion. A fact-check by Snopes.com confirms that the video in question is a digitally manipulated creation, not a genuine recording of a volcanic eruption in New Zealand.  The fact-check definitively states that the video is the work of an artist, Filip Hodas, and that no such event took place. They provide detailed information on the video's origin, its creation, and the deliberate nature of its artistic manipulation.  The fact-check's high confidence score (10) and its detailed explanation leave no room for doubt about the video's authenticity. The external validation fully corroborates the internal analysis, indicating a complete mismatch between the image content and the caption's claims.  Both assessments independently and conclusively demonstrate that the caption is out of context; there's no evidence to link the artistic creation in the video to a volcanic event in New Zealand. The high agreement between the internal (confidence score: 0) and external (confidence score: 10) assessments leads to a strong conclusion that the caption is completely false and out of context. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty regarding this conclusion.  No reasonable interpretation of the visual evidence, coupled with the definitive external confirmation, would suggest otherwise. The visual discrepancy, lack of supporting evidence, and the explicit external debunking converge to a highly confident assessment of the caption's falsity.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation conclusively demonstrate that the news caption is false.  Internal analysis reveals a complete mismatch between the image (pink and purple smoke cloud) and the caption's description (a pink volcano erupting in New Zealand). External fact-checking by Snopes.com definitively confirms that the video is digitally manipulated, not a real event, further corroborating the internal findings."

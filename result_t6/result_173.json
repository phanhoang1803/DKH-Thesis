        "content": "There are some good arguments for lowering the drinking age from 21: It is unpopular among most young adults; it arguably encourages underground binge drinking; enforcement is a complete failure on college campuses. And it is notable, of course, that an 18-year-old is considered an adult in almost every context -- including in the voting booth -- except when ordering a beer.\nBut research has shown that a drinking age of 21 does reduce alcohol use by those under 21, including high school students. Alcohol consumption by young adults has demonstrable and serious costs: for example, a lower drinking age leads to more traffic fatalities. Indeed, traffic accidents are a primary reason why Vietnam-era experimentation with lower drinking ages was abandoned. Other impacts of lowering the drinking age may be less obvious, but no less costly.\nMy research with Angela Fertig examined the impact of the drinking age by looking back at the 1980s, when many states moved from a minimum of 18 to 21. Our study found that a lower drinking age was associated with a statistically higher risk of unintended pregnancy and, largely as a result, worse infant health.\nResearch by economists Christopher Carpenter and Carlos Dobkin shows that arrest rates for violent and nuisance crimes rise sharply at age 21 and persist through at least age 23. A lower drinking age would likely cause this period of alcohol-related criminal activity to start earlier and last longer. Evidence also suggests that a lower drinking age leads to higher levels of binge drinking later in life among men.\nAny move toward increasing alcohol availability to young adults must consider its adverse effects, including traffic fatalities, unplanned pregnancy and crime. Policies like increased public transit availability, access to birth control and educational initiatives focused on harm reduction rather than abstinence have been shown to mitigate the detrimental effects of alcohol use by young adults. Lowering the drinking age will only succeed as part of a comprehensive set of policies that address the unintended consequences.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption states that the legal drinking age has been raised to 23.  Both the internal and external validation checks found this claim to be unsupported by evidence. The image shows two glasses of a flaming alcoholic beverage, but it contains no information about the legal drinking age.  The internal check's confidence score is 0, indicating a lack of textual evidence within the image to support the caption. Similarly, the external check also has a confidence score of 0 and provides no supporting evidence for the caption.  The external check explains that while resources may discuss arguments for and against changes in drinking age, it didn't find any evidence to support a claim that the legal drinking age had been raised to 23.  Therefore, there is a complete lack of support for the caption's claim from both visual and external textual sources. The internal and external validation results are fully consistent in rejecting the caption's accuracy. There is no ambiguity or disagreement between the two checks. No visual tampering or miscontextualization is apparent. The visual content (flaming alcoholic drinks) is unrelated to the text (a statement about changes in drinking age). Given the complete lack of support and the consistent findings of both checks, the confidence score is rated as 10, representing complete certainty that the caption is out of context. The caption is definitively unrelated to the image content.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks unanimously reject the caption as being out of context.  There is no supporting evidence in the image, and external resources do not corroborate the claim about raising the drinking age to 23."

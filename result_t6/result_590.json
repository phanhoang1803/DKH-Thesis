    "explanation": "The image shows a singer performing on stage. The caption claims that a KGB agent admitted the Sex Pistols were financed by the USSR to destabilize Western democracy.  There is no visual evidence in the image to support this claim. The image contains no indication of the Sex Pistols, the USSR, KGB agents, or any political themes related to Western democracy. Internal validation finds the caption unrelated to the image content (confidence_score 0). External validation strongly refutes the claim, citing Snopes' fact-check which labels it as false and attributes the origin to a satirical source (confidence_score 10).  The complete mismatch between the image and the caption, along with strong external evidence confirming the falsity of the caption's claim, leads to a high confidence level that the caption is out of context. There's no ambiguity; the image and claim are wholly unrelated. No visual tampering or miscontextualization is detected.  The external evidence definitively overrides the internal assessment, leading to a final confidence score of 10. The internal check's low confidence score reflects the lack of connection between the visual data and the text.  The external check's high confidence score stems from the reliable source directly contradicting the claim. In summary, both internal and external analysis confirm that the caption bears no relation to the image and thus is completely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm that the caption is out of context. The image depicts a singer, unrelated to the caption's claim about KGB financing of the Sex Pistols and its impact on Western democracy.  External fact-checking definitively refutes the caption's assertion."

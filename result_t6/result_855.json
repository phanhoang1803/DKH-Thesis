It did not come from Clinton's verified Twitter account. It appears to have been created and shared as millions braced for the powerful storm. Dorian pummeled the Bahamas, hovering over the northern part of the Caribbean country for more than three days before moving off and threatening states in the U.S. southeast region.\nThe fake tweet plays on long-standing, wide-ranging conspiracy theories about the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons. The foundation's recovery-assistance efforts in Haiti after a devastating 2010 earthquake have also been the source of a number of unfounded claims.\nClinton, who served as secretary of state during the Obama administration and was President Donald Trump's Democratic rival in 2016, did not write the above tweet. The only thing Clinton tweeted about Dorian were safety tips for Florida residents as the storm approached.",

    "explanation": "The image shows Hillary Clinton smiling, but it does not provide any information about her soliciting donations for Hurricane Dorian relief.  The internal validation correctly points out this lack of visual evidence supporting the caption's core claim. The external validation, a Snopes fact-check, definitively refutes the claim, rating it as \"False.\"  Snopes explicitly states that the tweet alleging Clinton's request for large donations was fabricated and not from her verified account. There is complete agreement between the internal and external validation methods.  Both methods agree that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects this strong agreement and the definitive evidence from the Snopes fact-check, which directly addresses and refutes the claim in the original caption.  The image is not misleading in itself; it simply lacks the information asserted in the caption.  Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context, with a very high degree of certainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations agree that the caption is out of context. The internal check notes the lack of visual evidence, and the external check cites a Snopes fact-check that refutes the caption's claim as false."

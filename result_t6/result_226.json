        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

The video circulating online is identified as a comedy skit, not a genuine depiction of government-sanctioned actions by the Maasai tribe.

    "explanation": "The internal validation check identifies inconsistencies within the image and caption. While the image shows a person who seems to be of Maasai tribe in Kenya, there is no evidence of whipping or enforcement of self-quarantine orders. The internal check gives a confidence score of 7 due to the presence of Maasai and Kenya but expresses uncertainty due to the absence of whipping and self-quarantine aspects. The external validation provides stronger evidence against the caption's claim. Snopes.com refutes the claim, identifying the video as a comedy skit and not a genuine depiction of government-sanctioned actions. This external validation is given a lower confidence score of 2, because while it refutes the main claim, it acknowledges the use of violent tactics by the Kenyan government to enforce curfew but not using the Maasai tribe. Considering both internal and external checks, there is strong evidence that the original caption is out of context. The visual evidence alone doesn't support the caption's claim of whipping people who disobeyed quarantine rules. The discrepancies arise from the caption mentioning actions not shown in the still image. The internal check, despite noting the presence of relevant elements like \"Maasai\" and \"Kenya,\" is unsure about the actions described. The external check directly refutes the core claim, establishing clear disagreement. Weighing both, the conclusive assessment leans heavily on the external check which provides credible evidence from a reliable source, hence the higher confidence score of 8. The claim is definitively out of context because it describes a scenario not depicted in the image and directly contradicts external validation from a fact-checking website.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows partial consistency with the image but lacks evidence for the central claim. External validation strongly refutes the caption's claim, identifying the video as a comedy skit. Both checks point to the caption being out of context."

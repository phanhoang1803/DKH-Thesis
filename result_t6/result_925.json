Wald was a prominent jurist, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian award.  Online searches corroborate that Patricia Wald received this medal in 2013. There are no discrepancies or uncertainties between the internal and external checks. The visual evidence aligns perfectly with the textual information.  No visual tampering or miscontextualization is detected. All details – the individuals, the setting (likely the White House), and the Presidential Medal of Freedom – are consistent and verifiable. The high confidence scores from both internal (10) and external (10) checks further reinforce the accuracy and reliability of the caption. Therefore, the caption is deemed accurate and not out of context.",

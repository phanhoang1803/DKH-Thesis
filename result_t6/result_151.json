Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here.\nIn February 2021, a few weeks after Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, a few social media users appeared to be in denial of reality as they held on to the idea that former President Donald Trump was somehow still the commander in chief. When a photo of Biden in the Oval Office started circulating online, they claimed that the photo was not taken at the White House but actually showed a movie set:\nThis photograph was taken on Feb. 5, 2021, as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a meeting in the actual Oval Office to discuss their COVID-19 relief package. ABC News reported:\nIn an Oval Office meeting with House Democrats on Friday, Biden recounted how as vice president, then-President Barack Obama had tasked him with pushing through legislation on Capitol Hill to address the recession.\n\"It was hard as hell to get the votes for it to begin with, and then it was hard as hell to get even the number we got,\" Biden said at the start of the gathering. \"But one thing we learned is, you know, we can't do too much here; we can do too little. We can do too little and sputter.\"\nThe claim that this photograph was taken on a movie set is based entirely on what appears, at first glance, to be a crack in the wall behind Biden. This crack, however, simply shows a partially opened door.\nThe Oval Office has four doors, two of which were designed to blend in with the walls. Here's a photograph of Trump that shows the same \"crack\" that can be seen in the viral image of Biden. In the Trump photo, it's clear that this \"crack\" is just a door:\nWhile these \"hidden\" doors may conjure up thoughts of secret passages or escape pathways, there isn't anything secret about these doors. They are just normal doors that open up to rooms adjacent to the Oval Office. The decision to blend them into the walls appears to have been a purely aesthetic choice.\nHere's another video from the Oval Office that showcases these doors. In 2010, former President Barack Obama met with some students featured in the documentary \"Waiting for Superman.\" At one point, one of the kids asks Obama about these strange looking doors:",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check incorrectly states that the image shows President Biden in what appears to be the Oval Office and that the caption accurately reflects this.  However, the external validation check, referencing a fact-check from Snopes, decisively refutes this.  The external check provides strong evidence that the image depicts Biden in the actual Oval Office, not a movie set designed to resemble it.  The supposed 'crack' in the wall, mentioned in the context of the false claim, is identified as a partially opened door.  This discrepancy arises from a misinterpretation in the internal check. The internal check lacks the crucial external verification to assess the image's context accurately. The visual evidence itself doesn't explicitly reveal whether the Oval Office is a movie set or the real one, requiring external fact-checking. The external source (Snopes) provides irrefutable evidence that the photograph was taken in the real Oval Office, which is crucial evidence for determining that the caption is out-of-context. Therefore, based on the more reliable external validation and the evidence it provides, we conclude the caption is out-of-context. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence provided by the external fact-check source, which outweighs the flawed internal assessment. The internal validation's low confidence score and lack of external verification lead us to reject its conclusion in favor of the well-supported findings of the external validation.  In essence, visual evidence alone is insufficient to conclude whether the location is a genuine Oval Office or a movie set. External validation is critical in determining this. The external check's strong evidence (photographic and video evidence from Snopes) and high confidence score directly contradict the internal assessment.  Thus, the claim that the picture was taken on a movie set designed to look like the Oval Office is decisively false.",

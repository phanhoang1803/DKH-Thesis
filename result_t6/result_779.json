    "explanation": "The original caption claims that CNN host Anderson Cooper is laughing uncontrollably at Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway.  Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check yielded a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False. The image clearly shows Anderson Cooper, but it does not depict Kellyanne Conway at all.  There is no visual evidence of any interaction between them, let alone Anderson Cooper laughing uncontrollably. The absence of Kellyanne Conway in the image directly contradicts the caption's core assertion.  The internal check's explanation is thorough and completely justified by the image's content.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation also resulted in a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False. The external check explicitly states that there's no information found in supporting articles or resources to corroborate the claim of Anderson Cooper laughing at Kellyanne Conway. The lack of any supporting evidence significantly weakens the credibility of the original caption. The external check's lack of corroborating evidence reinforces the internal check's findings.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nThere are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external validation checks. Both checks independently confirm the inaccuracy of the original caption.  There is no uncertainty surrounding the absence of Kellyanne Conway from the image or the lack of external evidence supporting the caption's claims.\n\nVisual Evidence:\nThe image itself unequivocally supports the findings of both internal and external validation.  The image solely depicts Anderson Cooper in a formal setting, with no other individuals present, let alone Kellyanne Conway.  There is no visual evidence of laughter, uncontrolled or otherwise.  The visual evidence directly contradicts the narrative presented in the original caption.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the combined results of internal and external validation and the clear visual evidence, the original caption is deemed completely out of context (OOC). The confidence score is 10 because there is no ambiguity in the findings of both validation methods and the direct visual evidence. The absence of Kellyanne Conway and the lack of any interaction or laughter in the image irrefutably demonstrate that the caption's description doesn't match the visual reality.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks, supported by visual evidence, confirm that the caption is completely out of context.  The image shows only Anderson Cooper and contains no evidence of the interaction described in the caption."

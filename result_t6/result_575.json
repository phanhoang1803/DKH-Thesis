        "content": "KENOSHA, Wis. (AP)  Anger over the shooting of a Black man by police spilled into the streets of Kenosha for a second night Monday, with police again firing tear gas at hundreds of protesters who defied a curfew, threw bottles and shot fireworks at law enforcement guarding the courthouse.\nThe southeastern Wisconsin city became the nations latest flashpoint in a summer of racial unrest after cellphone footage of police shooting Jacob Blake  apparently in the back, as he leaned into his SUV while his three children sat in the vehicle  circulated widely on social media Sunday. The 29-year-old was hospitalized in serious condition.\nThe shooting drew condemnation from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who also called out 125 members of the National Guard on Monday after protesters set cars on fire, smashed windows and clashed with officers in riot gear the previous night.\nPolice first fired tear gas Monday about 30 minutes after the 8 p.m. curfew took effect to disperse protesters who chanted, No justice, no peace as they confronted a line of officers who wore protective gear and stood shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the courthouse entrance. But hundreds of people stuck around, screaming at police and lighting fires, including to a garbage truck near the courthouse.\nTensions had flared anew earlier Monday after a news conference with Kenosha Mayor John Antarmian, originally to be held in a park, was moved inside the citys public safety building. Hundreds of protesters rushed to the building and a door was snapped off its hinges before police in riot gear pepper-sprayed the crowd, which included a photographer from The Associated Press.\nPolice in the former auto manufacturing center of 100,000 people midway between Milwaukee and Chicago said they were responding to a call about a domestic dispute when they encountered Blake on Sunday. They did not say whether Blake was armed or why police opened fire, they released no details on the dispute, and they did not immediately disclose the race of the three officers at the scene.\nThe man who said he made the cellphone video, 22-year-old Raysean White, said he saw Blake scuffling with three officers and heard them yell, Drop the knife! Drop the knife! before the gunfire erupted. He said he didnt see a knife in Blakes hands.\nThe governor said he has seen no information to suggest Blake had a knife or other weapon, but that the case is still being investigated by the state Justice Department.\nThe officers were placed on administrative leave, standard practice in a shooting by police. Authorities released no details about the officers and did not immediately respond to requests for their service records.\nEvers was quick to condemn the bloodshed, saying that while not all details were known, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the officers must be held accountable.\nThis morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force, he said, just over two months before Election Day in a country already roiled by the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Those shots pierce the soul of our nation.\nRepublicans and the police union accused the politicians of rushing to judgment, reflecting the deep partisan divide in Wisconsin, a key presidential battleground state. Wisconsin GOP members also decried the violent protests, echoing the law-and-order theme that President Donald Trump has been using in his reelection campaign.\nAs always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident, Pete Deates, president of the Kenosha police union, said in a statement. He called the governors statement wholly irresponsible.\nThe shooting happened around 5 p.m. Sunday and was captured from across the street on the video posted online. Kenosha police do not have body cameras but do have body microphones.\nIn the footage, Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of his SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns pointed and shout at him. As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire while Blake has his back turned. Seven shots can be heard, though it isnt clear how many struck Blake or how many officers fired.\nWhite, who said he made the video, said that before the gunfire, he looked out his window and saw six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk. A few moments later, Blake drove up in his SUV and told his son, who was standing nearby, to get in the vehicle, according to White. White said Blake did not say anything to the women.\nWhite said he left the window for a few minutes, and when he came back, saw three officers wrestling with Blake. One punched Blake in the ribs, and another used a stun gun on him, White said. He said Blake got free and started walking away as officers yelled about a knife.\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Blakes family, said Blake was simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident.\nPolice did not immediately confirm either mans account.\nBlakes partner, Laquisha Booker, told NBCs Milwaukee affiliate, WTMJ-TV, that the couples three children were in the back seat of the SUV when police shot him.\nThat man just literally grabbed him by his shirt and looked the other way and was just shooting him. With the kids in the back screaming. Screaming, Booker said.\nBlakes grandfather, Jacob Blake Sr., was a prominent minister and civil rights leader in the Chicago area who helped organize a march and spoke in support of a comprehensive housing law in Evanston, Illinois, days after the 1968 slaying of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\nRachel Noerdlinger, publicist for the National Action Network, told The Associated Press that the Rev. Al Sharpton spoke Monday to Blakes father, who called the civil rights leader for his support. Blakes father will speak at Sharptons March on Washington commemoration on Friday, Noerdlinger said.\nKarissa Lewis, national field director of Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations that make up the broader Black Lives Matter movement, said the shooting was yet another example of why activists have called for defunding police departments.\nTheres no amount of training or reform that can teach a police officer that its wrong to shoot a Black man in the back seven times while his children watch, Lewis said in a statement first shared with the AP.\nOnline court records indicate Kenosha County prosecutors charged Blake on July 6 with sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. An arrest warrant was issued the following day. The records contain no further details and do not list an attorney for Blake.\nIt was unclear whether that case had anything to do with the shooting.\nCrump, who has also represented the Floyd and Taylor families, said Blakes family has asked that demonstrations in response to his shooting remain peaceful.\nThey dont believe violence to be the solution, he said.\nFor more than 100 years, Kenosha was an auto manufacturing center, but it has now largely been transformed into a bedroom community for Milwaukee and Chicago. The city is about 67% white, 11.5% Black and 17.6% Hispanic, according to 2019 Census data. Both the mayor and police chief are white. About 17% of the population lives in poverty.\n___\nWebber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

    "explanation": "The internal validation gives high confidence that the caption accurately reflects the image content: a burnt-out truck with a sign calling for an end to violence. The image itself strongly supports this. However, the external validation casts significant doubt. The external source mentions a burnt garbage truck near a courthouse, but doesn't corroborate the presence of a sign advocating for the cessation of violence.  This discrepancy creates a major conflict. The lack of external corroboration significantly weakens the claim that the caption accurately reflects the event's broader context. While the image is internally consistent with the caption's description of the burnt truck and sign, the absence of external evidence supporting the broader narrative (specifically the \"next day\" and the event's context) reduces overall confidence. The discrepancy arises because the image provides a snapshot, while the caption suggests a narrative involving a specific timeline and broader context of violence that the external source doesn't support. The external source's limited information makes it impossible to conclusively confirm or deny the caption's broader context, leading to a conservative assessment.  Therefore, while the image itself aligns with part of the caption, the lack of external evidence to support the complete narrative leads to a conclusion of out-of-context. The low confidence score reflects the significant uncertainty created by the conflict between internal and external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's description of the image; however, external validation fails to corroborate the broader context described in the caption. This discrepancy, coupled with the limited information from external sources, leads to an assessment that the caption is likely out-of-context."

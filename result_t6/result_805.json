        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes indicates that the image is miscaptioned.  While the image shows a cruise ship and something dark in the water, the evidence states that it is sand and mud stirred up by the ship's turbines, not human waste. Therefore, the news caption is inaccurate.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 states that the image is frequently shared with claims of waste dumping, but this is incorrect.  Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment, explained that the brown clouds are sand and mud.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The news caption claiming the image depicts a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check correctly identifies a lack of visual evidence supporting the claim. The image shows a cruise ship, but no visible human waste is being discharged.  The description states that the image is \"misleading,\" which accurately reflects the absence of proof in the visual data. The confidence score of 3 reflects the certainty of this internal analysis, acknowledging that while the presence of a cruise ship is verifiable, the claim about waste dumping is not. \n\nThe external check further strengthens this conclusion.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, verifies that the image is frequently misrepresented. The external check provides compelling evidence that the brown discoloration in the water is not human waste, but rather sand and mud disturbed by the ship's propellers.  This explanation is supported by a statement from Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment.  The confidence score of 2 for the external check reflects the reliability of Snopes and the authoritative source corroborating the miscaptioning. \n\nThere is complete agreement between internal and external checks. Both conclude that the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  The external check adds crucial context by providing a credible explanation for the brown discoloration in the water, eliminating ambiguity and confirming the misinterpretation of the image.  No discrepancies or uncertainties exist between the internal and external validation results. There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image is genuine, but its interpretation in the original caption is incorrect. \n\nThe high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong and consistent evidence from both internal visual analysis and external fact-checking, which conclusively demonstrates that the original caption is out of context and does not accurately represent the image.  The image depicts a cruise ship in the ocean, near a disturbed patch of sand and mud, not a ship illegally dumping human waste. The combination of the internal lack of visual evidence and the external refutation from a reliable source leaves no room for doubt.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively refute the news caption. Internal analysis finds no visual evidence of waste dumping, while external fact-checking confirms the image is frequently miscaptioned; the discoloration is sand and mud, not waste."

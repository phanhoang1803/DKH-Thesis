The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal validation correctly identifies the movie poster as \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" featuring Kate Winslet. However, the external validation from Snopes contradicts the original caption's claim. Snopes definitively states that Disney's announcement of a remake with Kate Winslet in March 2018 is false, citing a lack of press releases or news articles to support this claim.  The external check's high confidence score (10) and the lack of supporting evidence make its finding highly reliable. Therefore, the original caption is out of context because it presents information that is factually incorrect according to a reliable external source. The visual evidence supports the film title and Kate Winslet's presence but doesn't inherently confirm the alleged announcement date or the validity of the remake claim. While the image itself is not manipulated or miscontextualized, the caption uses it to support a false narrative.  There is a clear discrepancy between the internal validation, based solely on the visual content of the image, and the external validation, which uses credible sources to assess the accuracy of the caption's claim. The external validation's findings are prioritized due to their higher reliability and supporting evidence, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the image shows \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" with Kate Winslet.  External validation (Snopes) refutes the caption's claim of a Disney remake announcement in March 2018, deeming it false.  The external evidence is conclusive, overriding the internal visual assessment. The caption is therefore out of context."

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the caption's accuracy.  The internal check notes that the image shows an SUV arriving at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, NY, which aligns with the caption's description. The external check confirms that Michael Cohen was President Trump's former personal attorney and served time at a federal correctional institution. While the exact date of his arrival at Otisville can't be verified directly from the image or external sources at this time, the information available makes the general scenario plausible. There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The visual details, showing an SUV approaching a correctional facility, directly support the narrative presented in the caption. There is strong agreement between the visual evidence, internal textual analysis, and readily available external information. However, the exact date of arrival stated in the caption cannot be definitively confirmed, slightly lowering the confidence score.  Therefore, a minor reduction in the confidence score reflects this limitation in certainty while the overall accuracy and alignment of the caption remain very high.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The image shows an SUV at the Otisville correctional facility, aligning with the caption's description of Michael Cohen's arrival. External checks confirm Cohen's status as Trump's former attorney and his incarceration, making the scenario plausible, although the exact arrival date is unverified."

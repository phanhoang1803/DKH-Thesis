    "explanation": "The internal validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy, achieving a perfect confidence score of 10. The image clearly shows Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street, which aligns precisely with the caption's description. The caption's mention of Brexit and the EU is also consistent with the political climate during May's premiership.  However, the external validation, while supportive, presents a lower confidence score of 7. The external source (presumably a news article) provides contextual information about May's efforts to secure a Brexit deal and her potential resignation, aligning with the general timeline and events described in the caption. Yet, the source doesn't explicitly corroborate all specific details in the caption, such as the cabinet's agreement on a draft deal or her precise statement about stepping down earlier than intended. This discrepancy between the internal and external validation results leads to a lowered overall confidence score. The lack of direct confirmation of all aspects of the caption from the external source, despite the general context's alignment, is the primary reason for assigning \"OOC: true\".  The image itself is not in dispute; it is the certainty of the caption's complete accuracy, specifically the details of the Cabinet agreement and the exact wording of her resignation statement, that is uncertain.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (confidence 10), showing Theresa May at 10 Downing Street during the Brexit period. External validation provides contextual support but lacks explicit confirmation of all details (confidence 7), leading to uncertainty about the precise wording and specific events mentioned in the caption.  The discrepancy results in a lowered confidence and an \"out of context\" designation."

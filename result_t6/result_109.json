        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 3,
      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes.com actually debunks the claim in the news caption.  While the image shows a cruise ship and brown discharge in the water near a coastal city, the investigation revealed the discharge was sand and mud stirred up by the ship's turbines, not human waste. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate.",
      "supporting_points": "The Snopes article explicitly states that the image is miscaptioned and that the brown cloud is actually sand and mud churned up from the ocean floor, not human waste.  The article also details how cruise ships treat their waste, indicating that the discharge of untreated human waste is unlikely.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both agree that the original news caption is inaccurate. The internal check identified a lack of visual evidence supporting the claim of human waste dumping, assigning a confidence score of 3.  The external check, referencing Snopes.com, definitively debunks the caption, providing strong evidence that the brown discharge is sand and mud stirred up by the ship's propellers, not human waste. This external check also had a confidence score of 3.  The combination of these checks, coupled with a visual inspection of the image, which reveals no visible signs of human waste, strongly suggests that the caption is out of context and misleading.  The image shows a cruise ship in proximity to what appears to be stirred-up sediment in the water; however, there is no visible evidence to support the claim of human waste dumping.  The clarity of the image, showing the ship and the surrounding water, allows for a relatively confident assessment of the visual evidence.  Therefore, the final confidence score is 9 out of 10, reflecting a high degree of certainty that the caption is inaccurate and out of context based on both visual and external verification.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes confirm that the original news caption is inaccurate. The image shows a cruise ship near stirred up sediment, not evidence of human waste dumping. External verification from Snopes.com strongly supports this conclusion."

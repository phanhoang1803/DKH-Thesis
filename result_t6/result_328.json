Several disturbing images from the blackout went viral on social media. One image shared on several different Twitter accounts, however, had nothing to do with that power outage, despite claims to the contrary:\nThe author of the above tweet asserted this image to be taken in Texas during the 2021 blackouts, but this is impossible. The image used in that tweet has been on the internet for years.\nFor example, the image appears in a January 2018 article on EbaumsWorld titled \"36 Amusing Pictures That Will Destroy Your Boredom.\" It can be found, as well, in a December 2019 article about preventing frozen pipes on the website of the company Thompson Building Associates.\nBecause the photo predates the Texas blackout by several years, online claims linking it to current events in Texas are \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows high confidence (confidence score: 10) in the caption's plausibility based solely on the image content. The image depicts a significant ice buildup inside a house, which is consistent with a scenario where frozen pipes burst during a period of extreme cold, such as the Texas blackout.  However, the external validation (confidence score: 10) strongly contradicts this assessment.  The Snopes fact-check definitively proves the image is not from the Texas blackout in February 2021, but predates this event by several years. This external evidence is robust and reliable, coming from a reputable fact-checking source. The discrepancy arises from a limitation of the internal check:  it only assesses the visual consistency and the general plausibility of the scenario, not the temporal context or the provenance of the image. The external check, however, provides crucial information that overrides the internal assessment.  The fact that the image has been circulating online since at least 2018, long before the Texas blackout, irrefutably demonstrates that the caption is incorrect and the image has been misattributed. There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image itself is genuine, but its association with the Texas blackout is entirely false.  Given the strong external evidence, we must prioritize the external validation results. Therefore, the caption is determined to be out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation initially supported the caption due to visual consistency with the described scenario. However, strong external evidence from Snopes fact-check definitively proves that the image predates the Texas blackout, rendering the caption false. The external evidence overrides the internal assessment."

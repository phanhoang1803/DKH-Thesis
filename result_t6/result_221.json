(AP)  A beloved giraffe at a zoo in South Dakota has died.\nOn Thursday, the Great Plains Zoo and Butterfly House & Aquarium in Sioux Falls announced the death of Chioke, an 18-year-old reticulated giraffe. He died March 28.\nFollowing a severe fracture in his front left foot, Animal Care and Veterinary leaders made the difficult, but responsible, decision to humanely euthanize him, the zoo said in a news release.\nChioke, born in Busch Gardens in Tampa, Florida, came to the zoo in 2007. He grew to nearly 15 feet tall and sired three offspring, who went on to other zoos. The Great Plains Zoo remembered him for his playfulness.\nHe had recurring hoof and foot issues in his later years, including two fractures to the tip of his toe bone and resulting arthritis, the zoo said. He suffered a more serious fracture in March.\nThe zoo consulted nationwide for a treatment plan and used several methods, including drugs, rest and laser therapy, but ultimately decided to euthanize Chioke due to quality-of-life concerns after his team had ruled out immobilizing him for surgery or an orthopedic device, and X-rays showed the fracture had worsened.\nZoo staff visited the giraffe to say goodbye, feeding him apple biscuits, a favorite of his.\nWe remember Chioke as a gentle, curious, mischievous giraffe who was always up for feedings and interacting with his keepers and guests, the zoo said. Chioke means gift from God, and he certainly was.",

    "explanation": "Internal validation suggests the caption is accurate because the image clearly depicts a giraffe in a zoo-like setting. The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10. However, external validation contradicts this. An external source indicates a news report about a giraffe's death at the Great Plains Zoo, suggesting the image may not be from Denver Zoo as the caption claims. This external check has a low confidence score of 3.  The discrepancy arises because the image itself doesn't contain any identifying information (like a zoo sign) to definitively confirm its location. While the internal analysis is strong based on visual observation, the external information casts doubt on the caption's accuracy regarding the specific zoo. Therefore, considering both pieces of evidence, we must conclude the caption is likely out of context. The final confidence score is low (4) due to the lack of definitive visual or external evidence to pinpoint the zoo's location.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (score 10), identifying a giraffe in a zoo. External validation contradicts this (score 3), citing a news report about a giraffe's death at a different zoo.  The image lacks identifying information, making it difficult to confirm location.  Hence, the caption is deemed out of context."

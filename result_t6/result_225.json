These pictures were purportedly taken in Thailand in December 2004, but they actually date from 2002 and depict not a tsunami, but a tidal bore (unusually high tides resulting in waters flowing upstream at high speeds) on the Qian Tang Jiang River, in Hangzhou, China.\nTidal bores occur at predictable times, and watching these events is a four-day-long government-sponsored tourist festival in China, hence there were plenty of people and photographers on hand to observe the one captured in the pictures above. Several news outlets in a variety of countries have been taken in by these photos and have run them as genuine pictures of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\nLast updated: 11 January 2005\nSources:\nChakrawertti, Samiran. \"After the Deadly Tsunami, a Photo Hoax Wave.\"\nThe Times of India. 7 January 2005.\nHollemans, Ellen. \"Citizen Falls Into Tsunami Trap.\"\n[South Africa] Mail & Guardian. 10 January 2005.\n[South Africa] Mail & Guardian. \"The Citizen Eats Humble Pie.\"",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal validation strongly supports the caption, finding a perfect match between the image and the description of a massive wave approaching a crowded beach.  However, the external validation completely contradicts this assessment.  External sources explicitly state that the image is not from the 2004 Asian tsunami, but rather a 2002 tidal bore in China. This discrepancy is critical and necessitates a careful evaluation. The high confidence score of 10 from the internal check is based solely on the visual content matching the description. However, this visual match is irrelevant if the image itself is misrepresented and not what it is claimed to be. Visual inspection alone cannot definitively confirm if the image depicts a tsunami; the visual appearance of a large wave is insufficient to conclusively classify it as a tsunami. Other events, like tidal bores, can exhibit similar visual characteristics. The external check's high confidence score of 10 and its clear evidence from reliable sources indicating that the image shows a tidal bore, significantly outweighs the internal validation. The external evidence is substantial and directly refutes the caption's claim. Therefore, while the image visually appears consistent with the caption's description of a tsunami hitting a crowded beach, the external evidence proving that it is a misrepresented image of a tidal bore makes the caption inaccurate and misleading. This leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There is no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization within the image itself; the issue lies in the misidentification and misrepresentation of the event. Visual details do align with the caption's description internally, but this internal consistency is rendered meaningless by the definitive external evidence that the image is not what the caption claims. This results in a high confidence level that the caption is out of context (OOC).",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption based on visual appearance. However, external validation definitively refutes the caption's claim, identifying the image as a 2002 tidal bore in China, not the 2004 tsunami. The external evidence is conclusive and outweighs the internal visual assessment."

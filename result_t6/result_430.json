        "content": "Claim:\nNASA warned that Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) could hit Earth in April 2020 and cause catastrophic danger.\nOn April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earths surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earths surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earths surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earths surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earths atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earths surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

      "explanation": "The news caption's claim that NASA warned of a catastrophic asteroid impact in April 2020 is partially supported and partially contradicted by the evidence.  The evidence confirms that Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was predicted to pass by Earth in April 2020 and that it is large enough to cause catastrophic damage if it hit. However, the evidence strongly refutes the claim that NASA warned of an imminent catastrophic impact, stating that the asteroid would pass at a safe distance of 3.9 million miles from Earth, far outside the range of posing a threat.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 directly quotes the claim, but then goes on to explain that the asteroid would not come close enough to hit Earth.  The source also notes that many news outlets created alarmist headlines exaggerating the danger.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that NASA warned of a catastrophic asteroid impact in April 2020, causing catastrophic danger.  Internal validation flags uncertainty because while the image shows an asteroid and NASA's involvement is plausible, the specific asteroid's designation and the claim of an imminent impact are not visually verifiable. The lack of visual evidence for the claimed catastrophic danger further weakens the internal assessment.\n\nExternal validation reveals a discrepancy.  While external sources confirm the existence of Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) and its predicted pass near Earth in April 2020, they contradict the caption's assertion of a NASA warning of catastrophic impact.  The evidence strongly indicates that the asteroid passed at a safe distance, far outside any threat range. News outlets are cited for creating alarmist headlines exaggerating the danger. \n\nThe disagreement between internal and external checks highlights the caption's inaccuracy. Internal validation identifies uncertainty regarding the specific details (asteroid designation, imminent impact) while external validation directly refutes the core claim of a NASA warning about a catastrophic impact.  Both checks converge on the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The confidence score reflects this convergence of evidence indicating that the caption is a misrepresentation of the event, likely an exaggeration of an actual news story.  The visual evidence supports the presence of an asteroid but does not confirm or refute the claim of an impending catastrophic impact and its context within the specified timeframe.",

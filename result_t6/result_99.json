        "content": "Claim:\nA video documents the U.S. Navy's wasteful practice of launching pickup trucks into the water.\nOn 9 February 2019, the Facebook page \"The Other 98%\" posted a video that supposedly showed a truck being launched via a catapult off the deck of the USS Gerald Ford. The video was accompanied by a message suggesting that the United States could easily afford to pay for the Green New Deal proposed in Congress or Medicare for all since the Navy was wasting so much money dumping trucks into the water:\nThe text overlaid on the video reads: \"Trucks were just launched off the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to test its jet catapult system. Don't ever let anyone tell you we can't afford Medicare for all or the Green New Deal.\"\nSeveral things are wrong with this assertion:\nThis incident didn't \"just\" happen. The video is from 2015.\nThe object being launched is not a commercially available truck. This is actually a weighted sled (referred to by the Navy as a dead load).\nThese sleds can be retrieved from the bottom of the river.\nEconomic estimates for the proposed Green New Deal or Medicare for All vary, but they can't be compared to the cost of a few wasted pickup trucks.\nThis viral clip originated with a video uploaded to the U.S. Navy's YouTube page in 16 June 2015 and shows a test of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), a catapult system designed to launch aircraft. At the time, the Navy was using dead loads to mimic the weight of an aircraft:\nHere's a better look at the \"truck\" in the video:\nThe viral Facebook video suggests that the Navy was being wasteful, as these \"trucks\" were lost and left to decay in the water. But that's not always the case. These tests were conducted in the relatively shallow waters of the James River (as opposed to the ocean) and can usually be retrieved for additional tests. A contemporary report from Engadget noted that this specific sled (which was not equipped with any electronics, an engine, or any other especially expensive materials) was recovered from the James River:\nThe Navy has been testing the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System or EMALS for months aboard the Gerald R. Ford carrier, but this is the first time a \"dead-load\" (or a weighted steel sled that weighs up to 80,000 pounds) is involved. Its advantages over traditional catapults that use steam instead of electromagnetic energy include smoother acceleration and its ability to place less stress on the aircraft -- plus, it was designed to work even with more advanced carriers that the military will surely use in the future. It will take a long time before any plane goes near the system, though: the Navy has already retrieved the sled above from the depths of the James River to conduct more dead-load launches.\nIn July 2017, the first fixed-wing airplane was launched using EMALS:\nWhile one could certainly argue that the U.S. government wastes money on certain projects that would be better spent on more worthwhile endeavors, this viral Facebook video isn't the best example to support this argument. This \"truck\" is actually a weighted sled and wasn't lost to the water.",

Source 1 confirms that a video depicts an object being launched from the USS Gerald Ford using a catapult system.  While Source 1 clarifies that the object wasn't a truck but a weighted sled used to test the system, the core claim of a catapult launch from the USS Gerald Ford is supported.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation processes produced conflicting results regarding the accuracy of the news caption. The internal check found the caption to be inaccurate with a confidence score of 10, primarily because the image shows no truck being launched.  The external check, however, yielded a different result. While acknowledging that the launched object was not actually a truck but a weighted sled used for testing, the external validation judged the caption as partially true because a launch from the USS Gerald Ford did occur, giving it a confidence score of 8.  This discrepancy stems from a difference in interpretation: the internal check focuses on the literal accuracy of the caption's description, while the external check acknowledges the core event (a catapult launch from the USS Gerald Ford) as being truthful, even if the object's identity was misrepresented. The visual evidence strongly supports the internal check's assessment; no truck is visible in the image. The external evidence doesn't contradict the visual evidence.  The external evidence introduces a new fact—the launch of a weighted sled—that wasn't present in the original caption.  Therefore, while the external source provides some supporting evidence of a launch event on the USS Gerald Ford, it does not change the fact that the caption is factually inaccurate concerning the object being launched. Because the visual evidence corroborates the internal check's assessment and the external check only partially confirms the caption (while adding additional information), the final assessment is that the caption is out of context. The lower confidence score (7) reflects the conflicting results and the additional information provided by the external source. While the image doesn't show a truck being launched, and thus the caption is inaccurate, the external source provides some contextual background of a launch event aboard the ship.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly refutes the caption due to the absence of a truck in the image.  External validation partially supports the claim of a catapult launch from the USS Gerald Ford but reveals that the launched object was not a truck, creating a discrepancy. Visual evidence confirms the internal findings. The final assessment is that the caption is out of context."

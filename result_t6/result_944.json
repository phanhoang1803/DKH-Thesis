The photo, which was taken of Trump with his parents in 1992, has been altered.\nTHE FACTS: The manipulated photo, edited to make it appear Trumps parents are wearing Klan garb, has circulated before on social media. It surfaced again this week on Facebook and Twitter.\nThe original photo was taken by Judie Burstein in 1992, according to Globe Photos, a celebrity and entertainment photo company that archived the image in March 2004.\nThe image shows Trump in a red tie and a black suit standing with his arms wrapped around his mother and father. Mary Trump is wearing a pink and black floral suit, with pearls draped around her neck. Fred Trump is wearing a navy suit, red pocket square and polka dot tie. The three Trumps posed for the photo against a marble wall backdrop and a sign that reads theater tickets.\nTrump followed his father into the real estate business. Fred Trump, who made a fortune in real estate, died in 1999 at the age of 93. Mary Trump died in 2000, at the age of 88.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claiming that the photograph depicts Donald Trump posing with his parents in Ku Klux Klan robes is demonstrably false.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly support this conclusion.\n\nInternal validation reveals significant uncertainty. While the image shows Trump with his mother and another man in robes, the robes' affiliation with the KKK remains unconfirmed.  The internal check acknowledges the need for further information to verify the claim, assigning a low confidence score of 4. This uncertainty highlights the limitations of relying solely on visual inspection for such sensitive claims.\n\nHowever, external validation provides robust evidence contradicting the caption. Multiple reliable sources explicitly state that the circulating photograph is fabricated; it's a digitally altered version of an original image.  These sources detail how the original photo shows Trump's parents in regular attire and explain the process of alteration that added the robes and symbols, thus misrepresenting the scene.  The external check provides a high confidence score of 10, emphasizing the definitive nature of its findings. \n\nThe discrepancy between the internal and external checks highlights the importance of corroborating visual evidence with reliable external sources, especially for sensitive and potentially misleading content. The low confidence of the internal check underscores the limitations of visual analysis alone and the potential for manipulation.  The high confidence and strong evidence from external sources, however, convincingly demonstrate the falsity of the original caption.  The image has been manipulated, and the caption is therefore out of context and inaccurate.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation identified uncertainty due to ambiguous visual evidence, while external validation conclusively proved the image was digitally altered and the caption is false. The external evidence outweighs the internal uncertainty, leading to a conclusive assessment of the caption's falsity."

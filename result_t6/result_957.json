        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump said that he planns to eradicate Section 8 housing, welfare, and Medicaid.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 9 November 2016, web site FAMMTV published an article (bearing the unquestionably provocative title: \"DONALD TRUMP TELL BLACKS \"KISS YOUR SECTION 8, WELFARE & MEDICAID GOODBYE\") which appeared to report that president-elect Donald Trump said he planned to get rid of assistance programs that are purportedly being abused by \"lazy\" Americans:\nWhen Donald Trump officially take office, you can expect some major changes. Donald Trump believe Americans became lazy with all of the government assistance programs that the government offer the people. Donald Trump recently said \"Americans will no longer be able to be lazy, and depend on the government to take care of them\".\nMany working American believe a lot of government assistance programs need to be abolished. One of them programs are Section 8. Why do a such program exist anyway? Well Donald Trump doesn't believe in any of it and believe working citizens of America would like to see their tax money being spent in better ways than taking care of able working Americans that simply refuse to. Even though there are working Americans that are on Section 8, 75% of Section 8 recipients go through numerous jobs, and some refuse to work at all.\nAnother program Donald Trump doesn't believe in is Welfare. Although he openly admitted that he see the point in the program, he don't think Americans understand that if should be used to help those get on their feet instead of a reliable source of income. He believe American need to recreate jobs and recreate American Businesses that other countries are now benefiting from.\nThe article's lack of any substantiating material should have been a clue that it was not a real story. Had Trump made any sort of divisive or racist assertion of the sort (such as implying that social programs like Section 8 housing exist solely to benefit black people), those comments would have been unquestionably newsworthy in the wake of his upset victory in the 2016 election.\nUnited States presidents are not vested with the power to either create or pass laws on their own:\nThe president does not have the power to create or rewrite legislation  that is Congresss job. He is not authorized to dispense with or suspend the law. British kings made this practice familiar to the Framers of the Constitution, who deliberately chose to deny such a power to the president ... lets start by referring to the Constitution. Article II charges the president with the duty to carry out the law  to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.",

      "explanation": "The provided evidence directly addresses the claim in the news caption. Source 1, from Snopes, rates the claim as false.  The article explains that a hoax news site falsely reported that Donald Trump planned to eliminate Section 8 housing, welfare, and Medicaid. While the source mentions Trump's views on government assistance programs, it emphasizes that he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally abolish them and that the original claim was unfounded.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes fact-check article explicitly states that the claim is false.  The article details how the claim originated from a hoax news site and lacked any supporting evidence. It also highlights that the president does not have the power to unilaterally abolish such programs.",

    "explanation": "The news caption claims that Donald Trump planned to eradicate Section 8 housing, welfare, and Medicaid.  Internal validation reveals that the image shows a sign indicating acceptance of food stamps and EBT, which are related to welfare programs. However, the image itself contains no information about Donald Trump or his plans. This discrepancy suggests the caption is out of context with respect to the image. External validation further strengthens this conclusion.  A Snopes fact-check article confirms that the claim about Trump's plan is false. The article traces the claim to a hoax news source and points out the factual inaccuracy of the statement. The external validation provides strong evidence that the caption is not supported by verifiable information. Therefore, both internal and external checks consistently indicate that the caption is out of context with respect to the provided image. The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement between the internal and external validation methods, which both support the conclusion that the claim is false and unrelated to the image content.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image lacks any information relating to Donald Trump or his plans concerning welfare programs, and external fact-checking confirms that the claim made in the caption is false."

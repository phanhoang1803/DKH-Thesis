        "content": "Claim:\nActor-comedian Bill Murray died at age 81 in February 2019, expressing a wish to see Americans united under Trump.\nOn 9 February 2019, the Conservative Tears website published an article reporting that actor-comedian Bill Murray had died at the age of 81, expressing that he \"wanted to see America unite under President Trump\":\nBill Murray Dead at 81  Wanted To See Americans United Under Trump\nWilliam Billington Bill Murray is dead this evening in his home in Winnetka, Wisconsin. Murray, who left public life a few years ago to pursue a more conservative lifestyle, found out he was dying about three months ago but decided not to make a big deal out of it.\nAccording to his spokesman and lawyer, Art Tubolls, Murray left very simple instructions for his passing:\nBill wanted to see America unite under President Trump and come together to fight against all the things hes fought against his entire career. When he wrote the movie Ghostbusters he used Slimer as an example of how feeding something causes dependence. Stripes was to teach the average American that anyone can be a hero if the timing is right.\nNone of this was true: at the time this report was published, Bill Murray was still very much alive and only 68 years old. The report of his death was another fabrication by Conservative Tears, a site which is part of the America's Last Line of Defense network of websites and Facebook pages that pump out a steady stream of inflammatory and politically divisive misinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"",

The Snopes article explicitly states the claim was false at the time of publication.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 from Snopes.com directly refutes the claim in the news caption, stating it was a fabrication by a website known for spreading misinformation.

    "explanation": "The news caption is definitively false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check correctly identifies a discrepancy: the image shows Bill Murray, but the caption claims he died at 81 and made a specific political statement. The image provides no evidence to support this claim.  The external check strengthens this conclusion by citing a Snopes.com fact-check that directly debunks the claim.  Snopes identifies the origin of the false information as a website known for spreading misinformation, further diminishing the credibility of the caption.  There is no ambiguity or disagreement between the internal and external checks; both point decisively to the falsity of the caption. The visual evidence further supports this conclusion.  The image shows Bill Murray, but there is no indication of his age at the time of the image nor any indication that it depicts him expressing the political views attributed to him. The caption's claim is entirely unsupported by the visual evidence.  In summary, all lines of evidence, visual, textual, and external fact-checking, strongly refute the news caption's claims, establishing that the caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm that the caption is false. The image shows Bill Murray, but the caption falsely claims his death at 81 and attributes a political statement to him which is unsupported by any evidence in the image or via external verification.  Snopes.com debunks the claim conclusively."

        "content": "The Clintons and George Soros are likely bedfellows when it comes to conservative conspiracy theories, and now that union is allegedly official.\n\"Did you know?\" begins a July 22 Facebook post with what looks like a doctored image of Chelsea Clinton and George Soros. \"Chelsea Clinton is married to Mark Mezvinski (sic). Mark Mezvinski is George Soros (sic) nephew!!\"\nThis post, which includes the words @illuminati killers, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim isnt a new one, and it was amplified by the actress Roseanne Barr last year when she accused Clinton of being married to Soros nephew and tweeted: \"Chelsea Soros Clinton.\"\nClinton retweeted Barr  Barrs tweet has since been deleted  and said: \"Good morning Roseanne - my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soross nephews are lovely people. Im just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day!\"\nOpen Society Foundations is a philanthropic organization founded by Soros.\nClinton married her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, whose name was misspelled in the Facebook post, in July 2010. Reuters reported that the only high profile guests seen in the town where they married other than former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under Bill Clinton, actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, and fashion designer Vera Wang.\nMezvinsky is an investment banker and the son of Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, both former Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nSearching the Nexis database for anything involving the couple, George Soros, and the word \"nephew,\" we found 35 news stories. They were all about Roseanne Barrs allegation that Clinton is married to Soross nephew. And they didnt corroborate her claim.\nWe couldnt find any evidence to lend credence to this Facebook post. We rate it Pants on Fire!",

      "explanation": "The Politifact article directly refutes the claim that Chelsea Clinton is married to George Soros' nephew.  The article details Roseanne Barr's false claim, Chelsea Clinton's response denying the claim, and a search of news databases that failed to find any evidence supporting the claim.  The article concludes by rating the claim as \"Pants on Fire!\"",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that Chelsea Clinton is married to Marc Mezvinsky, not George Soros' nephew.  It cites Chelsea Clinton's own denial of the claim and a lack of corroborating evidence from news databases.",

    "explanation": "The original caption, \"Chelsea Clinton is married to George Soros' nephew,\" is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check correctly identifies the image as depicting George Soros but points out the absence of Chelsea Clinton or any reference to her marital status in the image itself.  The confidence score of 0 reflects the image's lack of direct evidence pertaining to the claim. The external check provides compelling evidence from a Politifact article.  This article thoroughly investigates the claim, citing Chelsea Clinton's denial, a lack of supporting evidence in news databases, and the fact that she is married to Marc Mezvinsky, not George Soros' nephew. The Politifact article rates the claim as \"Pants on Fire!\"  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check reflects the thoroughness and reliability of the Politifact investigation, which utilized multiple sources and fact-checking methodologies. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks; both definitively refute the original caption.  The image itself is not misleading; it simply doesn't provide any information about Chelsea Clinton's marital status. Therefore, the original caption is completely out of context with respect to the provided image. There is no visual evidence or contextual clues within the picture that would support the false claim. The image features George Soros alone, making any connection to Chelsea Clinton purely fabricated and unsubstantiated. The lack of any connection between the image and the caption, combined with the strong evidence from external fact-checking, leads to a high confidence score in the assessment that the caption is completely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly refute the original caption.  The internal check finds no evidence in the image, while the external check cites a reputable fact-checking source that debunks the claim. There is perfect agreement, resulting in a high confidence that the caption is out of context."

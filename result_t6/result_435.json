        "content": "Supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, the Democratic Republic of Congo's veteran opposition leader, have gathered in the capital, Kinshasa, to express their shock at his death.\nA prominent opponent of successive leaders, he was due to head a transitional council under a deal for President Joseph Kabila to step down.\nThe 84-year-old died in Belgium where he went last week for medical checks.\nThe information minister said he would be given a state funeral.\nMr Tshisekedi returned to Kinshasa last July to a hero's welcome after two years in Brussels for medical treatment.\nHis death comes at a sensitive time for DR Congo and follows fierce clashes last year when it was announced that President Kabila would stay in power until April 2018.\nMr Tshisekedi's death comes as the opposition and government were negotiating the departure of President Kabila after 16 years in power.\nThe unfinished talks still require the creation of a transitional government and agreement on election dates. Mr Tshisekedi had been expected to chair a transition oversight committee.\nHe was a brave proponent of democracy. For more than half a century, a vast nation could unite behind him, against the autocracy of Mobutu Sese Seko or the Kabilas, father and son. But in that time, Mr Tshisekedi became a monument in his own right. His intransigence, at times, may have hindered democratic progress.\nIn the past three years of Mr Tshisekedi's illness, his son Felix has taken an increasingly prominent role. The future of the the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party is now in the balance. Other, younger, opposition leaders may now find room for manoeuvre in transition talks that are expected to continue under the auspices of the Congolese bishops' conference.\nWitnesses say as word of his death spread in Kinshasa on Wednesday evening, clashes broke out between a small group of his supporters and police, who fired teargas.\nMourners who gathered at his son's house in Kinshasa said they were concerned about the future.\n\"This man sacrificed his life, his youth for us all. This man made us open our eyes. He was our icon. This man was an icon for Africa. He was great. We lost a great man,\" one woman told the BBC.\nAnother said his supporters saw him as incorruptible: \"He was an historic opponent. [Nelson] Mandela was the best and Tshisekedi comes after.\"\nDidier Reynders, the foreign minister of Belgium - the former colonial power - described Mr Tshisekedi as a \"remarkable political figure\".\n\"Belgium joins forces with the Congolese people in their grief and their desire to see his work bear fruit,\" the AFP news agency quotes him as saying.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows high confidence (confidence_score: 10) that the image depicts Mr. Tshisekedi with supporters. However, the external validation expresses low confidence (confidence_score: 3) because it cannot confirm if the event happened on a Thursday. The external source mentions supporters gathering after Mr. Tshisekedi's death, but the specific day isn't confirmed. This discrepancy between the internal and external validations reduces the overall confidence score.  The image itself doesn't provide any information about the day of the week. Therefore, while the image strongly suggests a gathering of Mr. Tshisekedi with his supporters, the lack of external confirmation regarding the day makes the original caption's claim of \"Thursday\" uncertain. This uncertainty and the significant difference in confidence scores between internal and external checks lead to the conclusion that the caption might be out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the image content, but external validation cannot confirm the day mentioned in the caption.  The discrepancy results in a low overall confidence and an out-of-context assessment."

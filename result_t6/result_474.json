Mr Bolton, who fell out with Mr Trump, says the former president has no consistent principles, only moods, grudges and an obsession with his image. Thus he could both threaten North Korea with fire and fury and hold three chummy summits with Kim Jong Un, for example, or both talk about leaving the NATO alliance and then reinforce its eastern flank.\nThis article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline Stranger danger\nFrom the March 30th 2024 edition\nDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents\nExplore the edition\nMore from Briefing\nThe Assad regimes fall voids many of the Middle Easts old certainties\nWhat if Syria abandoned its hostility to the West and stopped menacing Israel?\nSyria has exchanged a vile dictator for an uncertain future\nIt is not clear how stable or how benign the new regime will be\nGambling is growing like gangbusters in America\nTechnology and legal changes are spurring a betting bonanza\nThe Adani bribery case could upend Indian business and politics\nThe allegations against the corporate champion may end up being resolved diplomatically rather than in court\nThe war in Ukraine is straining Russias economy and society\nDespite advances on the battlefield, pressure is growing\nHow will Donald Trump handle the war in Ukraine?\nAnd how will Ukraine, Russia and Europe respond?",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence that the image accurately depicts President Trump. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy. The external check found that the original caption's assertion—that President Trump, even as a \"feeble commander in chief,\" could impose his will on the nation—lacks supporting evidence. The external source focuses on criticisms of Trump's foreign policy inconsistencies and lack of consistent principles, not on his ability to impose his will or his perceived feebleness as commander in chief.  The disagreement highlights a critical issue: the caption presents a subjective interpretation or opinion not directly supported by objective facts. While the image is accurately described in terms of who is present, the caption's evaluation of that person's political actions and power is unsupported and out of context. The internal and external checks disagree significantly regarding the caption's interpretation and analysis of President Trump's actions. The external check's low confidence score reflects the lack of supporting evidence for the caption's claims, making it a subjective assertion rather than a verifiable fact. The external source does not directly contradict the presence of President Trump in the image; however, it completely undermines the caption's judgment about his political strength or power.  Visual evidence simply confirms the presence of President Trump, but the image offers no information about the assertions made in the caption. The caption's claim should be regarded as unsupported conjecture. In summary, because the caption's core assertion is not substantiated by the provided external source or other readily available verifiable information,  it is deemed out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of President Trump, but the external check finds the caption's interpretation of his power and actions unsubstantiated and out of context. The caption presents an opinion, not a verifiable fact."

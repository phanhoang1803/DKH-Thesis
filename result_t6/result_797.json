        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

Snopes fact-check shows the photo is real, but the man is not a veteran; he was born without arms. While Trump did touch his face, the caption's claim about the man's veteran status is false.

    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score (8) because the image seems consistent with the caption at face value.  The image shows President Trump touching the face of a person with prosthetic arms, who might be interpreted as a veteran given the context. The caption accurately reflects this visual information. However, the external validation (confidence score 2) reveals a significant discrepancy.  The Snopes fact-check refutes the caption's claim that the man is a U.S. veteran.  The external source clarifies that the individual was born without arms, and not a veteran who lost his arms. This directly contradicts a central claim of the caption. Because the external source is a reputable fact-checking website, its information should be prioritized.  The discrepancy highlights a case of misrepresentation in the caption. Although the image visually depicts Trump touching the man's face, the context of the man being a veteran is false. The visual details support the interaction described, but the crucial element of veteran status is misleading, thereby making the caption out of context. The low confidence score reflects the significant difference between the internal interpretation and the reliable external fact-check, resulting in a final verdict of 'out of context'.  The internal check failed to account for crucial external validation which revealed that the presented image is fundamentally misinterpreted in the caption. Therefore, while the image itself is authentic, the caption's context is significantly flawed, making it an inaccurate representation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation suggests a high degree of accuracy, whereas external fact-checking reveals a significant factual error regarding the man's veteran status, leading to a final assessment of the caption being out of context.  The external evidence is prioritized due to its higher reliability and factual accuracy."

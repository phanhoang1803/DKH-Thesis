      "explanation": "Source 1 explicitly states that the FBI investigated whether President Trump's firing of James Comey was an obstruction of justice.  This is a key aspect of the news caption's claim that the FBI investigated the firing as a potential national security threat. While the source focuses more on whether Trump was working for Russia, the obstruction of justice angle is directly relevant to national security concerns.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The original news caption states that the FBI investigated whether the firing of James Comey was a national security threat.  Internal validation shows a low confidence score (7) because, while the image depicts James Comey surrounded by reporters, it doesn't provide any direct visual evidence of an FBI investigation into his firing. The image only shows Comey in a situation that could potentially relate to the investigation, but it doesn't show any agents or evidence of an active investigation.  The external validation has a higher confidence score (8) and supports the caption by citing a source that confirms the FBI's investigation into whether the firing was an obstruction of justice.  This is strongly relevant to national security concerns. Although the external source mentions the potential connection to Russia, the core fact of an FBI investigation into Comey's firing remains.  However, there's a slight mismatch between the caption's focus on a national security threat and the external source's emphasis on obstruction of justice.  While obstruction of justice can be considered relevant to national security, the caption's direct phrasing isn't fully corroborated by the source.  Considering the lower internal confidence score and the slight nuance difference between the caption's phrasing and the external source, the overall conclusion is that the caption is slightly out of context.  The image provides no explicit visual evidence of the investigation, and the external source's corroboration is indirect regarding the specific 'national security threat' aspect of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation reveals a lack of visual evidence supporting the claim of an FBI investigation in the image. External validation finds a source confirming an FBI investigation related to the firing, linking it to obstruction of justice, which is relevant to national security. A slight discrepancy exists between the caption's focus on 'national security threat' and the source's emphasis on 'obstruction of justice'. The low internal confidence and nuance difference lead to an overall OOC judgment."

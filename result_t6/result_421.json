It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence (score 10) in the accuracy of the caption based on the image content. The image clearly shows Jodie Foster and a quote related to wealth disparity. However, the external validation check reveals a crucial discrepancy.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, confirms the widespread circulation of this image and quote but definitively states that the quote is falsely attributed to Jodie Foster. This external evidence significantly undermines the caption's accuracy, despite the internal consistency.  The external check's confidence score of 8, while high, is lower than the internal check's score because it involves verifying information from an external source. The discrepancy arises from the mismatch between the image's visual content (Jodie Foster and the quote) and the quote's actual origin (unknown or falsely attributed). The internal check focuses solely on the image's immediate content, while the external check considers broader contextual information. While the image and quote are visually linked, the misattribution critically affects the caption's veracity, leading to a final judgment of 'out of context'.  Therefore, although the image visually supports the claim of a Jodie Foster quote on wealth disparity, the external evidence irrefutably demonstrates that the attribution is incorrect. This situation highlights the importance of corroborating information from multiple sources, particularly when dealing with potentially controversial claims or quotes. In this case, relying solely on the visual content would lead to an incorrect assessment of the caption's accuracy. The external fact-checking source provides crucial contextual evidence that directly refutes the caption's claim regarding the quote's authorship. This demonstrates the limitations of internal validation when used in isolation.  A thorough validation process needs to combine multiple validation approaches.",

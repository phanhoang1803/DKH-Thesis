In April, anti-government protesters demanded that the socialist president, Mr Ortega, step down over unpopular pension reforms.\nHowever, he refused to negotiate and instead sent in the security forces.\nHundreds were then killed in the space of weeks.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check finds the image consistent with the caption, identifying Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo and noting the November timeframe.  The external check corroborates this by citing a source that explicitly mentions Ortega and Murillo together in November, in their official roles as President and Vice President of Nicaragua. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. The image itself clearly depicts the two individuals, and their attire and setting align with expectations of a formal political event. The high confidence scores (10 from both checks) further reinforce the validity of the caption.  There's no evidence of visual manipulation or miscontextualization. The analysis of visual details is completely consistent with the internal and external findings. Therefore, the caption accurately reflects the content of the image.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  Danielle Schwartz didnt ask for an oil painting of her cat. But she loves the portrait of Stinky that hangs in her upstate New York home, a surprise gift from an unlikely place: an online pet store.\nIts one of the more than 1,000 free paintings that Chewy sends to select customers each week  even during the pandemic  tapping into peoples obsession with their fur children and, it hopes, winning customers for life.\nIn the cutthroat world of online shopping, that personal touch and a bit of kitsch is how Chewy is looking to stand out among the competition, which has only gotten stiffer as more people shop online and add pandemic pets to their families. Pet ownership is expected to grow 4% in 2020, the first increase in several years, according to the Petco Foundation.\nChewys strategy seems to be working on Schwartz, whose blue-eyed cat likes to rub up against the painting from his cat tree.\nI just want to buy everything from them, she says. Theyre a big company. I was shocked that they did something so personal.\nThe portraits have become a hit on social media, where people share images of them or beg for their pets to be turned into works of art.\nEric Sheridan, a sales specialist from Lee, Florida, asked for a portrait through the Twitter account of Gozer, his Boston terrier with more than 3,000 followers. A Chewy representative messaged back: My paws are crossed that well be able to send you one. It arrived a month and a half later. Christmas came early, Sheridan tweeted from Gozers account.\nNot everyone is delighted by getting a mystery portrait  the company acknowledges that some confused customers send them back. But many who get a pet portrait document it for social media, giving Chewy free advertising  a trend the company noticed when it first started shipping them out.\nCustomers were going bananas, says co-founder Ryan Cohen, who helped come up with the idea in 2013 before leaving the company.\nChewy was founded in 2011, marrying the fast delivery of Amazon with the friendliness of a local pet store. It also aimed to grab a piece of the fortune Americans spend on their pets, which was expected to total $99 billion in 2020, according to the American Pet Products Association. Pet store chain PetSmart bought Chewy in 2017 for more than $3 billion to grow its online business, but then spun Chewy off two years later into a publicly-traded company now worth about $40 billion, even though it has never made a profit.\nAmazon and Chewy dominate the online pet supplies industry, with Amazons market share at more than 50% and Chewys at 34%, according to retail consulting firm 1010data. But the pandemic has been especially good for Chewy as people avoid physical stores. Its stock price more than tripled in 2020. Sales soared 45% in the August to October quarter. And it added 5 million new customers in the last year, bringing its total customer base to nearly 18 million.\nPhillip M. Cooper, a pet industry consultant, credits the customer service. It set the standard, he says.\nThe companys 2,500 agents are trained to answer pet parents questions, like which foods are best for older pooches or where to find a shelter. Chewy sends new customers handwritten notes and all shoppers get snail-mail holiday cards. It even sends flowers to people whose pets died.\nIt helped ease the pain, says Jordan Redman of Norman, Oklahoma, who received a bouquet of flowers after Bud, her golden retriever, died.\nBut its the paintings that have customers panting. Theres no way to purchase one from Chewy, and the company doesnt exactly say how someone will be selected. But it typically sends them out to those that have pet photos on their Chewy account or have shared one with a customer service agent.\nFor clues, look to the experience of Danielle Moore, who said Chewy asked her to send a photo of her Australian cattle dog Kana during a call about returning an order. Kanas likeness showed up three months later. Moore loved it so much she tried to purchase another through Chewy, but the customer service agent wouldnt budge. Instead, the chemist from Dallas commissioned one for $36 on Etsy, and the paintings hang on a wall together.\nChewy doesnt disclose the cost of making and sending the portraits. It has worked with hundreds of artists around the country who are emailed photos of their subjects by the company.\nJosh Lawson, who paints 20 to 50 portraits a week, has done snakes, goats and even what he thinks were bison. It can take two hours or more to do a portrait. Fluffy kittens, for example, need extra attention and a long-tip brush to get the right amount of fluff. I want to make them look real, he says.\nTheres pressure to do so. Chewy says it rejects artwork that doesnt look enough like the pet or sends it back to be reworked. The goal is for people to talk up Chewy to others and to get a prime spot on shoppers walls, serving as a billboard for the company.\nAnnesley Clark, a law student in St. Louis, was surprised by how much the free painting looked like her pit bull mix, Willow. I was beside myself, she says. Its her exactly.\nShe couldnt wait to show it off. The next day, she took it to a socially-distanced picnic with four others and held up the artwork. I said, Look at this. Its perfect. Her friends agreed.\n_____",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence that the caption accurately reflects the image's content. The image depicts a man with three guitars, which aligns with the caption's description of him showing off final products he intends to sell. However, the external check reveals a complete lack of supporting evidence, indicating that the caption is likely out of context. The external check failed to find any information corroborating the assertion that the image shows someone showcasing products for sale. This significant discrepancy necessitates a low overall confidence score. The visual evidence strongly suggests that the man in the photo possesses and displays guitars; thus the internal consistency check was high. Nevertheless, without external validation or any contextual details confirming the narrative implied in the caption, it is impossible to confirm that the caption is accurate. It's entirely possible that this image was misinterpreted, and the context of the image wasn't fully understood. It is also plausible that the caption was created without access to reliable information related to the image's context, leading to an inaccurate description. Therefore, based on the contradictory findings, we conclude that the caption is out of context, with a low confidence score, reflecting the significant uncertainty in the accuracy of the provided caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation completely refutes it.  The significant discrepancy leads to a low confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

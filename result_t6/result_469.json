      "explanation": "The provided text mentions Kenya in a list of countries with events that occurred in 2020.  While it doesn't explicitly state a man chasing locusts in Samburu County on May 21, 2020, the inclusion of Kenya in the context of significant events during 2020 makes the caption plausible.  The lack of specific details lowers the confidence score.",

    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check strongly supports the caption's accuracy. The image clearly depicts a man running amidst a large swarm of locusts, consistent with the description of a man chasing locusts. The mention of Samburu County, Kenya, and the date adds specificity, although the image alone cannot independently verify this information. The external validation check provides supporting evidence by mentioning Kenya in the context of significant events in 2020, including locust swarms. Although it doesn't explicitly corroborate the exact details of the caption (the specific location, date, and the man's action), it aligns with the general context of locust plagues in Kenya during that period.  The lower confidence score from the external check is due to the lack of precise details. Discrepancies: The external check doesn't directly confirm the specific event described in the caption; it only supports the plausibility of locust swarms in Kenya in 2020.  This is not a contradiction, but a limitation of the external evidence. Visual details: The image is consistent with a locust swarm, the man's actions suggest he is attempting to evade or disperse the swarm.  There's no visual evidence to suggest tampering or miscontextualization. The quality of the image helps build confidence in the visual evidence. Conclusion: While the external check provides less specific validation than the internal check, both support the core assertion of the caption. The internal consistency and visual details strongly suggest that the caption is likely accurate.  However, the absence of complete external verification for the location, date, and precise event warrants a moderate confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy, showing a man interacting with a locust swarm. External validation offers contextual support but lacks specific details about the reported event. Visual evidence is consistent with the caption. A moderate confidence is assigned due to incomplete external verification."

        "content": "Donald Trump has signed an executive order to ban federal money going to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions.\nThe US president's order shows he \"wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn,\" his press secretary Sean Spicer said.\nThe executive order - known as \"the Mexico City Policy\" - is likely to concern pro-choice groups, already wary of his anti-abortion stance.\nMr Trump supports a US abortion ban.\nBut this is not the first time a foreign funding ban has been put in place. Republican President Ronald Reagan first created the Mexico City Policy in 1984 introducing the ban, only for the Democrats to later rescind it under the Clinton administration.\nThe policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to \"neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\".\nFor decades, it has been the case that no US money can be spent on overseas abortions but the Mexico City policy takes that a step further.\nIn 2009, Barack Obama ended the policy, which had been reinstated under President George Bush's tenure.",

The provided evidence focuses on President Obama's 2009 decision to end the Mexico City Policy, which restricted US funding for international organizations that perform or promote abortions. There is no mention of any order by Obama celebrating abortions on Mother's Day.  The caption is factually incorrect.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that President Obama issued an order for abortions to be celebrated on Mother's Day. This claim is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe image itself contains a news chyron that reads \"OBAMA PROCLAIMS MOTHER'S DAY TO BE RENAMED TO 'NATIONAL ABORTION FREEDOM DAY'.\"  However, the key word is \"proclaims.\"  The image does not show any actual official order or decree from the President. It presents a fabricated news story, which makes the internal validation unreliable for confirming the accuracy of the claim in the original caption.  The visual evidence shows a fabricated news segment with a provocative image designed to mislead the viewer. The statement \"Obama issued an order\" is thus not supported by the internal evidence.\n\nExternal Validation:\nExternal sources confirm that no such order was ever issued by President Obama.  There is no credible evidence to support the claim that he proclaimed Mother's Day to be \"National Abortion Freedom Day.\" The external sources point to the misinformation nature of the claim, further strengthening the assessment that the original caption is completely fabricated and out of context.\n\nDiscrepancies:\nThe primary discrepancy lies in the difference between what the manipulated image portrays and the reality.  The image attempts to create a false narrative of Obama's views on abortion and Mother's Day. External fact-checking sources are essential to debunk the false claim.  The internal analysis identifies a fabricated news graphic, which is used to mislead the viewer.  The external sources corroborate this assessment by confirming the falsity of the statement.\n\nVisual Tampering/Miscontextualization:\nThe visual evidence clearly shows signs of manipulation. The news graphic is a fabricated piece intended to present a false narrative. It uses the image of Obama and superimposes a fabricated news headline.  The image in the inset further enhances the deceptive nature of the whole message.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nBased on both the internal analysis of the image and extensive external fact-checking, the original caption is demonstrably false and out of context. The claim that Obama issued an order for abortions to be celebrated on Mother's Day is completely unsubstantiated and a clear example of misinformation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods confirm that the original news caption is false and out of context. The image presents fabricated news designed to mislead.  No credible evidence supports the claim that Obama issued an order celebrating abortions on Mother's Day."

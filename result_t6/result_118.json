        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check found some consistency between the image and the caption. The image shows a woman named Ricky Ellsworth, and the caption states that she was murdered by a Minnesota cop. However, this internal consistency is weak because the image alone doesn't confirm or deny the claim of murder by a Minnesota cop.  The external validation check, using a Snopes fact-check, strongly contradicts the caption.  Snopes reveals that the meme is false, likely conflating unrelated events. The fact-check points out that the woman depicted is not Ricky Ellsworth, the person named in the meme's claim about being killed by a Minnesota police officer, and that the actual events surrounding Ricci Ellsworth's death (note the different spelling) occurred in Tennessee and did not involve a police officer.  The fact-check acknowledges the case of Justine Damond, a white woman killed by a Minneapolis police officer, but emphasizes that this does not align with the information in the provided meme. The external check's high confidence score (10) and its direct refutation of the meme's central claim, bolstered by verifiable sources, outweigh the weak internal consistency based solely on the name in the image. The discrepancies between the internal and external checks are substantial, with the external check definitively proving the meme's falsity. Considering both the internal and external evidence, it's clear that the caption is out of context and misrepresents the facts surrounding Ricci Ellsworth's death. Visual inspection of the image did not reveal any obvious tampering or miscontextualization, but the external evidence completely overrules the weak internal evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation showed weak consistency between the image and the caption, while external validation using Snopes decisively refuted the caption's claim. The external evidence, with its high confidence score, outweighs the weak internal evidence, indicating that the caption is out of context."

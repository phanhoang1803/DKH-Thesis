    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that President Obama planned to replace the bald eagle with the bison as the national animal of the U.S.  Internal validation reveals a discrepancy: while the image depicts a bison, it lacks any visual elements related to President Obama or a national animal replacement. The internal check highlights the caption's partial relevance to the image but flags the absence of crucial elements mentioned in the caption.  External validation confirms the caption's inaccuracy.  The bald eagle remains the U.S. national animal; there is no credible evidence to support the claim of a proposed change under President Obama's administration. The external check reinforces the caption's falsity and identifies it as potentially a hoax or satire.  Both internal and external checks strongly indicate a mismatch between the caption and reality. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from both types of validation, which concur in deeming the caption as out of context and factually incorrect. The image's focus on a bison is irrelevant to the central claim of the caption regarding a presidential decision about the national animal. There is no visual evidence to suggest any connection between the image and the events described in the caption, further solidifying the out-of-context nature of the caption.  In conclusion, the strong agreement between the internal and external analyses, combined with the lack of visual support for the caption's core claim, decisively supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The image shows a bison, but the caption's claim about President Obama changing the national animal is factually incorrect and lacks any visual representation within the image."

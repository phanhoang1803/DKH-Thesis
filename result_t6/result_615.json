        "content": "Nearly a month after supporters of President Donald Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recounted the experience from her perspective.\nIn a 90-minute Instagram Live video, Oscasio-Cortez described fearing for her life as she hid in the bathroom of her office in the Cannon House Office Building, a part of the Capitol complex.\nDays later, the second-term congresswoman pushed back against right-wing critics who said she exaggerated the danger she faced during the riot.\n\"AOC wasnt even in the Capitol building during her near death experience,\" read one headline on RedState, one of several conservative websites that questioned Ocasio-Cortezs account.\n\"AOC lied!\" another headline said. \"She Wasnt Even in the Capitol Building During the RiotHer Life Was Never in Danger: Report.\"\nSimilar claims attacking Ocasio-Cortez cropped up in widespread posts on Facebook, where they were flagged as part of the companys efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nOn Twitter, hashtags likened Ocasio-Cortez to actor Jussie Smollett, who was indicted for false reports to police and accused of staging an attack against himself.\nThe criticism also reached cable news. \"There were no rioters in (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's) hallway,\" said Fox News host Tucker Carlson. \"Trump voters weren't trying to kill her.\"\nOcasio-Cortez stood by her remarks and pushed back against the attacks online. As she went back and forth on Twitter with conservative activist and One America News Network correspondent Jack Posobiec, readers asked PolitiFact what was true and what wasnt.\nIts true that Ocasio-Cortez was not in the main Capitol building where the House and Senate chambers are located as rioters broke in. She was in the Cannon building.\nBut she never claimed in her video to have been in the main Capitol building, and the Cannon building was one of two buildings in the broader Capitol complex that was forced to evacuate.\nOcasio-Cortez feared she \"could die\" as police knocked on her door\nIn her Instagram Live video, Ocasio-Cortez said she had just gotten off the phone with her chief of staff and was scrolling through lunch options at around 1 p.m. when she heard \"huge, violent bangs on my door.\" It was like \"someone was trying to break the door down,\" she said.\nAround that time, rioters were already gathering outside the Capitol, but they had not broken in, according to timelines from USA Today, the Washington Post and the New York Times.\nOcasio-Cortez said she ran over to her legislative director, Geraldo \"G\" Bonilla-Chavez, who told her to \"hide, hide, run and hide.\"\nAs she hid in her office bathroom behind the door, Ocasio-Cortez said she heard a mans voice yelling from inside her office. \"I just hear, Where is she? Where is she?\" Ocasio-Cortez told her Instagram Live viewers. \"And this is the moment where I thought everything was over.\"\n\"I mean, I thought I was going to die,\" she said.\nOcasio-Cortez said the person calling for her was actually a Capitol Police officer who did not identify himself  a fact she did not know as she hid.\nOcasio-Cortez said the Capitol Police officer told her to go to another building. She said she could hear \"all of these rioters behind the glass of the door\" as she and Bonilla-Chavez sought a place to take shelter. She ended up hunkering down in the office of Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., who also detailed the experience on Feb. 1 during an interview with MSNBC.\n\"I fully expected that by this point, the building had been breached and there were people walking the hallways,\" she said.\nThe attacks\nSome websites attacking Ocasio-Cortez cited comments from Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. Mace tweeted Feb. 2 that the rioters never made it to the hallway she shares with Ocasio-Cortez.\nMace was addressing a story from Newsweek, which erroneously reported that Ocasio-Cortez said rioters had entered her office. In her Instagram Live video, Ocasio-Cortez said that she was scared by the banging on her door because she did not know it was an officer.\n\"None of us knew in the moment what areas were compromised,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Feb. 4, after Mace shared a Fox News headline that used her comments to discredit Ocasio-Cortez.\nThe Cannon building was one of two buildings evacuated by Capitol Police as pro-Trump rioters outside moved toward to Capitol, which they broke into just after 2 p.m. It is a part of the larger Capitol complex, which is connected by underground tunnels accessible to lawmakers.\nSeveral lawmakers, including Mace, tweeted about the evacuation in real time. \"Just evacuated my office due to a nearby threat,\" Mace wrote in her Jan. 6 tweet posted at 1:45 p.m. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., said that the evacuation was due to \"a pipe bomb reported outside.\"\nThe Capitol Police did not respond to PolitiFacts inquiry about the evacuation. An FBI agents affidavit in support of an arrest warrant for one man charged in the riot said that the evacuation was \"in part because of a suspicious package found nearby.\"\nPipe bombs were discovered Jan. 6 near the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters. Both locations are within blocks of the Cannon building.\n\"They are manipulating the fact that most people dont know the layout (of) the Capitol complex,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet. \"We were all on the Capitol complex  the attack wasnt just on the dome. The bombs Trump supporters planted surrounded our offices too.\"\nA spokesperson for the congresswoman declined to comment further.\nThe criticism of Ocasio-Cortez also minimized the threat posed to lawmakers and police by the mob at the Capitol, as Snopes reported. Videos and photos show rioters fighting with police, carrying zip-tie handcuffs and weapons, and chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n\"Assassinate AOC,\" one man facing charges tweeted hours after storming the building.",

While it doesn't explicitly state \"TikTok and Twitter,\" the reference to \"widespread posts on Facebook\" and \"On Twitter\" strongly suggests the platforms mentioned in the caption were likely involved. The article focuses on the events surrounding the Capitol riot, but the presence of photos circulating online is implicitly confirmed.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies that the image depicts Dua Lipa, not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The caption's claim that photos of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez circulated widely on TikTok and Twitter in late 2020 and early 2021 is factually accurate according to external sources. However, the images provided show Dua Lipa, not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The discrepancy lies in the fact that the caption is accurate regarding the existence and spread of photos of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez online during the specified period, but the provided visual content is completely unrelated. The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this immediate mismatch between image and caption.  The external check's higher confidence score of 8 comes from verifying the claim about the online circulation of images of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  However, it fails to verify the claim's relevance to the specific images in question. The external source supports the caption's factual statement about the existence of AOC's photos online but does not confirm that the specific photos provided are of AOC. Therefore, the caption is considered out-of-context concerning the provided images. The visual evidence strongly supports the internal check. There is no visual evidence or indication that the images are of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The images clearly show Dua Lipa based on widely available images of the singer.  The high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong agreement between the internal visual analysis and the verified factual accuracy (but irrelevant context) of the caption's statement.  Despite the external check's higher numerical score, it supports only one part of the caption. The crucial element- the images in the provided picture being related to the caption - is not supported by the external check, and strongly contradicted by the internal visual evidence.  There is no reasonable doubt based on the evidence that the caption is out of context for this image. While external sources confirm the existence of widely circulated pictures of AOC, these specific pictures are definitively of Dua Lipa.  The final judgement is based on a careful evaluation of both internal and external evidence, with a strong emphasis on visual verification, which is paramount in this context.  External confirmation of a claim about a general phenomenon should not outweigh contradictory visual evidence relating to the image in question.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds a complete mismatch between the image (Dua Lipa) and the caption (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). External check confirms the caption's factual claim about online circulation of AOC's photos but doesn't validate its relation to the provided images.  Visual evidence strongly supports the internal check. The caption is out of context for the given images."

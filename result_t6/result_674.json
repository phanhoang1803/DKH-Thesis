    "explanation": "The internal check analyzes the image and concludes that the caption accurately reflects the visual content.  The bear appears to be chasing the cyclist. However, the external check, using a Snopes fact-check, reveals that the image is digitally manipulated.  The original image did not contain a cyclist; it was added later. This discrepancy highlights a significant issue: while the image, as presented, supports the caption, the underlying reality contradicts it. The high confidence score from the internal check is invalidated by the strong evidence of image manipulation confirmed by an external source.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because it describes a scenario not originally present in the photograph. The visual evidence alone, without knowledge of the image's manipulation, would indeed suggest a bear chasing a cyclist, but the external validation provides irrefutable proof of alteration, undermining the internal analysis. The high confidence score assigned by both checks highlights a weakness: internal analysis should always be tempered with external verification, especially when dealing with images found online that may have been altered. In this case, the external verification (Snopes fact-check) trumps the internal visual analysis, resulting in the conclusion that the caption is OOC. The explanation provided by the external check is comprehensive, detailing the image's origin and the process of its alteration. The supporting points in the external check clearly lay out the path of the image's history and manipulation. The fact that the cyclist was added in post-processing invalidates any conclusion derived solely from visual inspection. In conclusion, despite the apparent visual support for the caption, the external validation reveals a clear case of image manipulation, making the caption \"A photograph shows a bear chasing a cyclist down a mountain road\" out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation deemed the caption accurate based on the image's apparent content.  However, external verification (Snopes fact-check) proved the image was digitally altered, adding the cyclist. The external check is considered more reliable, indicating the caption is out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a driver evading police by bouncing the car off the roofs of two vehicles.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nIn April 2021, a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed someone evading police in a car by jumping the vehicle off a ramp, bouncing off the tops of of a semi-truck and a bus that were driving by, then landing on the other side of the road and driving away.\nAt the time of this writing, this video had been viewed more than 4.7 million times. This footage, however, does not capture a real car chase but computer generated images.\nIt was created by a 3D artist who uses the handle @2NCS on social media. When this video was posted to the artist's Instagram page, it was accompanied by hashtags such as #3d and #animation to indicate that this was a CGI video, not a genuine piece of footage.\n@2NCS identified himself on his website as a 23-year-old named Dionisis who lives in the United Kingdom: \"My name is Dionisis and I'm 23 years old. I live in UK. For me working as a car designer was a life goal. My motivation stems from the possibility that 3d graphics offer me, turning my imagination into reality. CGI is a great art that changed the way I express myself.\" Dinosis added that he uses the software programs Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe After Effects to create his videos.\n@2NCS has had a few other videos go viral after internet users incorrectly assumed that they were real. In 2019, for example, a video that supposedly showed a Lamborghini evading police by sliding underneath a truck racked up more than 10 million views.\nHere's a look at how that viral video was made:",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that a video shows a driver evading police by bouncing the car off the roofs of two vehicles.  Internal validation reveals inconsistencies. While the video shows a car performing a stunt and evading police, it does not accurately depict the car bouncing off the roofs of two vehicles. The car appears to jump over a structure, not bounce off vehicle roofs. This discrepancy lowers the internal confidence score.  External validation, through a fact-check by Snopes, definitively confirms that the video is computer-generated imagery (CGI), not a real event. This completely contradicts the caption's claim.  The external validation significantly strengthens the case against the caption's accuracy.  The high confidence score of the external validation (10) outweighs the moderate confidence score of the internal validation (7).  There is a clear consensus between internal and external checks that the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  The visual evidence, while initially suggesting a car stunt, is ultimately revealed to be CGI, rendering the claim presented in the caption as false and out of context.  The detailed explanation provided by the external source (Snopes) is highly reliable, leaving no room for doubt that the original caption is inaccurate and significantly misrepresents the video's content. Therefore, the final assessment concludes that the caption is out of context and the overall confidence score is high (10).",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations agree that the original caption is inaccurate. Internal analysis points out inconsistencies in the description of the car's movements, while external fact-checking confirms that the video is CGI, making the caption's claim entirely false."

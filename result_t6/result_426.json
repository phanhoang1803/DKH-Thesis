While the exact affiliation of the crowd is unclear from just the image, the caption's description of a police officer being dragged by \"caravan members\" is plausible based on the visual evidence.  The confidence score is not 10 because the caption assumes the crowd are \"caravan members\" which requires additional context not supplied in the image itself.",

It has been shared with text that says: Mexican official being dragged by the caravan. Anyone up for open borders??\nBut thats not true. The photo doesnt show migrants who are currently traveling north from Central America. It shows protestors during a clash with police in 2014. That demonstration had followed the disappearance, and suspected massacre, of 43 students in the Mexican city of Iguala. The clash with police in the photo happened in Acapulco.\nThis isnt the first time that an old photo has been paired with misinformation about the so-called caravan. Earlier we wrote about three old photos  one showed a bloodied officer from 2012; one showed an officer with a bloody nose from 2011; one showed an officer kneeling during another demonstration about the missing student teachers in 2014. Those three unrelated photos were circulating with this bogus claim: Mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico  And WE are supposed to believe these are just poor, helpless refugees seeking asylum???\nAlthough the photos have been shared thousands of times on Facebook, they have nothing to do with the group of migrants who are currently in the news.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\n2,300 migrant children in Central American caravan need protection, UNICEF says.

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal validation shows a moderate confidence (confidence score 8) in the caption's accuracy based solely on the image's visual content. The image depicts a police officer being pulled by a crowd, aligning with the caption's description. However, the caption's assertion that the crowd is composed of \"caravan members\" is not explicitly supported by the image itself, leading to a less certain score.\n\nHowever, the external validation provides strong contradictory evidence (confidence score 10), with sources explicitly stating that the image originates from 2014, depicting riots after the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. This directly refutes the caption's claim that it shows members of a migrant caravan.\n\nThe discrepancy between internal and external checks is significant. While the image internally supports the core action described (a police officer being pulled), the external evidence decisively refutes the contextual claim about the crowd being \"caravan members\".  The external information clarifies the event as a 2014 protest unrelated to any migrant caravan.\n\nGiven the robust external evidence that contradicts the caption's context, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context (OOC = true). The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong external validation that contradicts the caption's context, while acknowledging the internal assessment's partial accuracy in describing the depicted action. The external evidence clearly supersedes the limited contextual information gained from the image alone.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption's description of the action shown, but lacks explicit confirmation of the crowd's identity.  External validation strongly refutes the caption's claim about the context of the image, identifying it as a 2014 protest in Mexico unrelated to any migrant caravan."

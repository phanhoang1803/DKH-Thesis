        "date": "2019-02-15T11:00:40",
        "content": "\"I stand here before you tonight, as your Congresswoman-elect, with many firsts behind my name.\"\nSupporters greeted Ilhan Omar's emotional victory speech with rapturous applause when the Democrat won Minnesota's fifth congressional district in November 2018.\nThe 37-year-old mother of three is the first Somali-American, first African-born American, and one of the first two Muslim American women to serve in the US Congress.\nMs Omar has drawn adoration and criticism since that election success as one of a new generation of young politicians shaking up the status quo in Washington DC.\nShe recently clashed with the US envoy to Venezuela, in a clip that has since gone viral.\nBut while she has won support for her approach on Capitol Hill, she has also faced repeated accusations of anti-Semitism, and even allegations of campaign finance violations in Minnesota.\nWho is Ilhan Omar?\nMs Omar was born the youngest of seven siblings in Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 1981. Her mother died when she was two years old.\nRaised by her father and grandfather, the family fled the country during the Somali Civil War and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before moving to the US in 1995.\nOriginally working in education, she began her political career managing city council campaigns and working as a senior policy aide for Minnesota politicians.\nIn 2016 she won election to the state's legislature - unseating a 44-year incumbent in the process.\nMs Omar told the BBC in a 2017 interview that young people who \"believed more in my platform, my ideas, and the merit of what I stood for\" drove her to run.\n\"A lot of the elders and mainly the women in the community thought it would be better... if I took a back seat,\" she said.\nWhat do her fans think?\n\"A refugee girl came here and achieved the American dream,\" Somali refugee Awmam Mahdi told the BBC.\n\"I think it's very positive for everyone who is an immigrant,\" the Ohio resident said, calling her a \"role model\".\nMs Omar supports policies like greater healthcare coverage, more background checks for gun buyers, and abolishing the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\nDuring her victory speech she gave a powerful rebuke to the Trump administrations immigration stance, declaring: \"Here in Minnesota, we don't only welcome immigrants - we send them to Washington\".\nThe president had previously told Minnesotans Somali immigrants there were \"spreading their extremist views\" and joining the so-called Islamic State group.\nShe drew praise for fighting to change a 181-year ban on headwear in the House of Representatives, allowing her to wear a hijab for her oath of office, and holds a place on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\nPoliticians and analysts have identified her with of a number of young Democratic politicians disrupting the status quo on Capitol Hill.\nBoth 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Palestinian-American woman Rashida Tlaib - one of the first Muslim women in Congress, alongside Ms Omar - were also elected in November 2018.\nMs Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Ms Omar after a testy exchange with US special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, went viral.\nDuring a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Ms Omar brought up Mr Abrams role in the Iran-Contra scandal, in which the US secretly sold weapons to Iran and funnelled the proceeds to Nicaraguan anti-Communist groups.\nShe also questioned Mr Abrams comments on US policy in El Salvador, including when he seemingly downplayed a massacre in the town of El Mozote in 1981.\n\"Watching her question Trump's envoy... feels like justice,\" Ms Ocasio-Cortez wrote.\nMr Abrams called the exchange \"ridiculous\" and said he would not respond to a \"personal attack\".\n\"I don't think this entire line of questioning is meant to be real questions and so I will not reply,\" he said during the hearing.\nWhat do critics say?\nBut for all her fans, Ms Omar has not had the easiest start in Washington DC.\nShe has been repeatedly embroiled in controversy over remarks critics have called anti-Semitic.\nA 2012 post of hers resurfaced in which she claimed Israel had \"hypnotised the world\", provoking outrage for what many saw as an offensive characterisation of Jewish people.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attacked Ms Omar's \"prejudicial accusations\" and demanded an immediate apology.\nShe later did so, tweeting a statement saying she had colleagues \"educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes\".\nBut the controversy continued when Ms Omar, speaking at a Washington DC event in March, questioned what she termed \"the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country\" - in reference to pro-Israel lobbying.\nPeople from both parties again criticised the remarks, saying they played on anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish Americans having divided loyalties - though Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren all spoke out in her defence amid the furore.\nMr Sanders in a statement said people should not \"equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel\".\nPresident Trump has called on her to resign from Congress and \"certainly\" from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, calling the congresswoman \"terrible\".\nMs Omar wrote a tweet in response, saying: \"You have trafficked in hate your whole life\".\n\"I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you?\"\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions Rashida Tlaib and Bernie Sanders separately.  Source 1 mentions that both are politicians, but it does not state that they held a press gathering together or that Rep. Tlaib is a \"radical anti-Semite.\" The source mentions accusations of anti-Semitism against Ilhan Omar, not Rashida Tlaib. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim in the news caption.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows that the image does depict Bernie Sanders and Rashida Tlaib together, supporting a part of the caption. However, the caption's claim of Rashida Tlaib being a \"radical anti-Semite\" is a subjective and highly contentious statement not visually verifiable from the image. The internal check rightly flags this as a matter of opinion, not a visual fact.  The external check further weakens the caption's credibility.  It finds no reliable source supporting the claim of a joint press gathering to promote a shared vision for America, let alone evidence specifically labeling Rep. Tlaib as a \"radical anti-Semite.\"  The external check notes that some sources mention accusations of anti-Semitism against other figures, but these are not directed at Rep. Tlaib. The discrepancy lies in the caption's assertion of both the meeting and Tlaib's political stance, neither of which are confirmed by external sources. Since the external validation casts serious doubt on the core claims of the caption – the nature of the gathering and the characterization of Rep. Tlaib –  and the visual evidence only partially supports the caption, we conclude the caption is largely out of context. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty inherent in evaluating subjective political claims based on limited visual data and a lack of corroborating evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the image depicting Sanders and Tlaib, but not the negative characterization of Tlaib. External validation finds no support for the core claims of the caption regarding the nature of their meeting and Tlaib's political label. Discrepancy exists between the caption's assertions and verifiable facts, leading to an OOC classification."

        "content": "The president won about 73% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, Moise Katumbi, on 18%, officials said.\nThe 20 December election was marred by widespread logistical problems.\nIt had to be extended to a second day in some parts of the vast country.\nAbout two-thirds of polling stations opened late, while 30% of voting machines did not work on the first day of the vote, according to an observer group.\nMillions of people waited for hours before they were able to vote, while some gave up and went home.\nThe opposition said the problems were part of a deliberate plan to allow the results to be rigged in favour of Mr Tshisekedi, 60.\nSeveral of the main challengers have called for protests after Sunday's announcement.\n\"We call on our people to take to the streets en masse after the proclamation of the electoral fraud,\" they said in a joint statement.\nThe army has been deployed in various parts of the capital, Kinshasa, to prevent any unrest, while Mr Tshisekedi's supporters have taken to the streets to celebrate.\nThe head of the election commission has previously said the opposition candidates wanted a new election because \"they know they lost... they are bad losers\".\nElection chief Denis Kadima acknowledged some irregularities but insisted that the results reflected the will of the Congolese people.\nPresident Tshisekedi will be sworn in for a second term on 20 January.\nThe son of veteran opposition leader tienne Tshisekedi, the president was first elected in 2019.\nThat followed a poll which some observers, including the influential Catholic Church, said was won by former oil executive Martin Fayulu. He came third in this election with 5% of the vote.\nNone of the other 16 candidates gained more than 1% of the vote.\nMr Kadima said turnout was about 43% of the 41 million registered voters.\nIt is not clear if any of the 18 opposition candidates will challenge the results in court. Mr Katumbi has already said it is not worth it, because the courts are not independent.\nThe Constitutional Court has 10 days to hear any legal challenges before it is due to announce the final results on 10 January 2024.\nDR Congo is roughly four times the size of France, but lacks basic infrastructure. Even some of its main cities are not linked by road.\nAbout two-thirds of the country's 100 million population live below the poverty line, earning $2.15 (1.70) a day or less.\nVoters also chose parliamentary, provincial and municipal representatives, with about 100,000 candidates in total.\nDuring the campaign, Mr Tshisekedi repeatedly lashed out at Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, who he accuses of backing the M23 rebel group which has seized territory in the east of the country. Rwanda has repeatedly denied the charges.\nIn his last election rally, Mr Tshisekedi vowed to declare war on Rwanda, although observers dismissed this as rhetoric aimed at whipping up nationalist sentiment.\nThe elections were not held in parts of the east because of the fighting which has raged in the area for the past three decades. Some seven million people have been forced from their homes - more than in any other country except Sudan.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check found no evidence within the image to support the caption's claim that the people shown are supporters of Felix Tshisekedi in Kinshasa on Thursday. The image depicts people celebrating in the streets at night, but there are no visual cues (signs, banners, clothing, etc.) to indicate their political affiliation or location.  The lack of such visual indicators makes it impossible to verify the caption's claims based solely on the image. The external validation, however, offers some support for the caption. An external source mentions that Tshisekedi's supporters celebrated in Kinshasa's streets. This aligns with the celebratory nature depicted in the image. However, the external source does not definitively link the provided image to this event. The external source's information is broad and not specific to the given image, raising uncertainty. The disagreement between internal and external checks, coupled with the absence of specific visual details supporting the caption, necessitates a cautious approach. While the external source provides a context that is potentially related to the image content, the lack of visual evidence within the image itself linking it to the specified individuals and location leads to a low confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image's ambiguity prevents definitive confirmation of the caption's assertions.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds no support for the caption's claims within the image, while external validation offers some contextual alignment but lacks direct evidence linking the image to the specific event described. The lack of visual cues in the image makes it impossible to confirm the caption's claims with certainty."

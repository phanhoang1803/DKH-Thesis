        "content": "Claim:\nA video screen grab shows U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal flouting mask rules in the Capitol.\nIn the days following a riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, an incident that forced members of the Senate and House of Representatives to evacuate the area and take shelter, a number of lawmakers announced that they had tested positive for COVID-19. When Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Seattle announced that she, too, had tested positive, she laid the blame on her Republican colleagues who refused to wear a face mask:\nShortly after Jayapal made this announcement, some social media users started sharing a picture that supposedly showed Jayapal acting hypocritically by not wearing her own mask. The following picture is real, but it's sorely missing some context:\nThis image was taken as a pro-Trump mob pounded on the door of the House Chambers. As the area was put on lockdown, members of the House, staff, reporters and other personnel were instructed to take cover in the balcony and put on \"escape hoods.\" While it's difficult to tell in the viral picture of Jayapal (a clearer video of this moment can be seen later in this article), the representative can be seen holding one of these hoods.\nReporter Melanie Zanona mentioned these escape hoods in a comment about the Capitol riot to Politico:\nThe gallery staff started telling us, Were hearing we might have to go into lockdown. If thats the case, were going to have to lock the doors and escort you to inside the chamber. Theres a balcony that overlooks the House floor. They told us if we do go into lockdown, were all going to go on the balcony, take your snacks, take your cellphones. We might be there a long time if we do have to go into lockdown, so bring all the things you need. They also told us where the escape hoods were located.\nHere's a video of the moment. The person closest to the camera (left side of the frame) can be seen wearing one of these hoods (it looks a like a gas mask in a plastic bag). Jayapal can be seen holding this hood around the 9-second mark:\nJayapal responded to accusations that she wasn't wearing a mask in Congress on Jan. 12, 2021, writing:\nWhile taking cover under the seats of the gallery, we were instructed to take off our mask in order to put on a gas mask. Why did we need a gas mask in the House?\nBecause Trump and his Republicans had incited insurrectionists to launch a deadly attack on the Capitol. That's why.\nIt should also be noted that Jayapal's statement criticized her GOP colleagues for not wearing masks while \"locked down in a secured room at the U.S. Capitol.\" The above-displayed video screen grab was not taken in a \"secured room.\" This video was taken while the attack on the Capitol was just beginning, while lawmakers were still in immediate danger, and while they were being told to put on escape hoods before being moved to a more secure location.\nWhile the image of Jayapal without a mask is real, many people shared it without proper context.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the claim that the image shows Rep. Pramila Jayapal in the Capitol.  However, the image quality is low, making it difficult to definitively determine if she is or isn't wearing a mask.  The caption states she is \"flouting mask rules\", which requires a clear visual confirmation of mask non-compliance. The image doesn't provide this clarity.  While the external check cites Snopes's account, which mentions that she was preparing to put on an escape hood and that this was during a lockdown,  this additional context does not change the fact that the core visual assertion of the caption (mask non-compliance) is not definitively supported by the image itself. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because, despite identifying Rep. Jayapal correctly, it makes an assertion about mask-wearing that the image does not support conclusively. The low image resolution limits the verification accuracy, leading to a slightly lower confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirmed Rep. Jayapal's presence. However, the image's low resolution prevented conclusive verification of mask compliance, leading to an OOC judgment."

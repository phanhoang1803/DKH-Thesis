        "content": "Claim:\nA video clip shows supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders failing to identify a single country on an unlabeled world map.\nOn Feb. 17, 2020, Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map  with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\nCruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernies base,\" implied  if not directly asserted  that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\nThis is Bernies base  the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment  no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\nKimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:",

    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges limitations in verifying the claim directly from the image, assigning a low confidence score of 8.  The external check strongly refutes the caption's claim, providing evidence that the video was part of a comedy segment and the participants were not specifically identified as Bernie Sanders supporters.  This external evidence significantly lowers the confidence in the caption's accuracy. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks highlights the importance of relying on robust external verification when the visual evidence alone is insufficient.  The internal check correctly points out that the image only shows the individuals and an unlabeled world map; it does not reveal their political affiliations or their ability (or inability) to identify countries.  The external check's lower confidence score (3) reflects the possibility of errors or biases in external information. However, the overwhelming evidence suggests that the news caption is misleading.  The comedy context contradicts the serious tone of the original caption and introduces a significant element of misrepresentation. The visual content alone is insufficient for confirmation; it could be used in a variety of contexts, making it inconclusive. The external evidence provides concrete details about the context of the video that fundamentally alters the meaning of the visual data.  Therefore, considering both visual and external factors, the news caption is judged to be out of context. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty inherent in evaluating a claim based on limited visual evidence combined with potentially biased external sources.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the image inconclusive, while external check strongly refutes the caption's claim, revealing the video's comedic nature and the lack of evidence supporting the statement about Bernie Sanders supporters.  Discrepancies exist, but external evidence is highly significant, deeming the caption out of context."

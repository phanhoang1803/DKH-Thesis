According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\nRobs a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com  where the story originated  clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press theyve had no such complaints made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation finds the caption plausible given the image shows a damaged scuba tank and emergency responders, suggesting a possible accident. The external validation confirms the claim's presence in the original source, although it also notes that the claim was part of a hoax.  Both internal and external validations agree that the claim is present in the news context, but external sources clarify it as a hoax. The image, while consistent with an accident scenario, does not explicitly depict the specific event described in the caption. Therefore, although the caption's claim is verifiable in its context, it's ultimately out of context considering it was part of a false story. The discrepancy arises because, while the image supports a plausible accident scenario, the specific details in the caption (scuba tank filled with marijuana smoke, loss of testicles) are not directly observable and are definitively false according to external fact-checking sources. This makes the caption, although seemingly supported by visual evidence to a degree, ultimately out of context due to the deliberate falsehood of the core claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds the caption plausible based on the image's depiction of a damaged scuba tank and emergency response, suggesting a possible accident. However, external validation reveals that the claim was a hoax, despite being present in the original news source.  The final judgment is that the caption is out of context because the core event is demonstrably false, even though the image itself is not inconsistent with a general accident scenario."

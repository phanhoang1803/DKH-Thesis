That meme claimed BLM had raised \"over a billion dollars\" but had not used that money to provide necessities such as food, housing, or schooling; instead, they had expended it on buying \"huge charter busses to transport members to riots\":\nAs for the first part of the meme, BLM is a \"decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people\"; it isn't a centrally organized group that was founded for the purpose of feeding the hungry, providing housing, or funding schooling, nor does it raise money on that basis.\nMoreover, the photograph accompanying this meme does not show any buses purchased by BLM \"to transport members to riots,\" or for any other purpose. The vehicles pictured here belong to the Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, who wrapped their buses with the Black Lives Matter name as a show of support for the movement, as documented on the Raptors' Twitter account:",

Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"  The source explicitly states that the photograph does not show buses purchased by BLM and that the buses pictured belong to the Toronto Raptors, who used them to show support for the movement. This directly contradicts the caption's assertion.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies the presence of \"Black Lives Matter\" on the buses, giving a true verdict based solely on the image content. However, this internal validation is insufficient to confirm the caption's claim regarding the buses' use in transporting people to riots. The external check, using a reputable fact-checking website (Snopes.com), decisively refutes the caption's claim.  Snopes provides evidence showing that these buses belong to the Toronto Raptors and were used to express support for the Black Lives Matter movement, not to transport people to riots.  The high confidence score from the external check (10) significantly outweighs the lower confidence score of the internal check (10) due to its limited scope. The discrepancy highlights the importance of external verification when analyzing claims made in news captions.  While the image itself does show buses with \"Black Lives Matter\" branding, the context provided by the external source is crucial in determining the accuracy of the entire claim.  The significant and well-supported evidence from Snopes.com demonstrating that the caption is inaccurate, and the busesâ€™ ownership and usage are misrepresented, strongly suggests that the caption is out of context.  Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context (OOC = true) with a high confidence score of 10, reflecting the weight of evidence from the external fact-check.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms visual elements (buses with \"Black Lives Matter\"), but external check (Snopes.com) definitively refutes the claim about the buses' intended use, showing they belong to the Toronto Raptors and were used for showing support, not transporting to riots. The external evidence outweighs the limited internal analysis, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

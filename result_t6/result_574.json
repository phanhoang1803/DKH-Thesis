TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didnt come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely.

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that the image is a recruitment flyer for a group seeking to hire \"professional anarchists.\"  However, a thorough analysis reveals this claim to be false. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal validation check reveals a significant mismatch between the caption and the image content. The image depicts a graffiti artwork featuring a figure holding a bouquet of flowers. There is no mention of recruitment, anarchists, or any related terminology within the image itself. The internal check confidently concludes that the caption is inaccurate based solely on the image's content, assigning a confidence score of 0.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation process strengthens the finding of the internal check. External sources confirm that images circulating online purporting to be recruitment flyers for \"professional anarchists\" are fake and part of a disinformation campaign. These images are explicitly identified as containing fabricated information, such as fake contact details. This external evidence aligns perfectly with the internal assessment, offering a confidence score of 10 and further confirming the inaccuracy of the original caption.  The external source's high confidence score (10) outweighs the internal check's low confidence (0), ultimately yielding a high overall confidence score in the conclusion.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is no discrepancy between the internal and external validation checks. Both assessments consistently and independently conclude that the caption is misleading and does not accurately reflect the image's content. The external validation provides concrete evidence refuting the caption's claim, adding substantial weight to the conclusion.\n\nVisual Analysis:\nA careful visual inspection of the image confirms the internal assessment. The image clearly shows a stylized artwork; it lacks any text, logos, or symbols associated with recruitment or anarchist groups. The image's artistic style is inconsistent with the format typically used for recruitment flyers, further reinforcing the mismatch.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth internal and external validations conclusively demonstrate that the original caption is out of context (OOC). The image does not represent a recruitment flyer for \"professional anarchists.\" The combined evidence establishes a high level of certainty (confidence score of 10) in the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The external source provides substantial support for this assessment, solidifying the final verdict.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The image depicts an artwork, not a recruitment flyer, and external sources confirm that similar images are part of a disinformation campaign."

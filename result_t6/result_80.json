        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton got her wish that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought.\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, its an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds the image consistent with the caption, as both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are clearly visible. However, the external validation (Snopes) strongly contradicts this assessment. Snopes rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned,\" demonstrating that the quote attributed to Hillary Clinton is fabricated, and the image is a cropped portion from Donald Trump's wedding, misrepresenting the context.  The high confidence score from the internal check is based solely on the visual presence of Clinton and Trump, failing to consider the crucial element of the false quote. The external check's high confidence, coupled with Snopes' detailed explanation of the fabricated quote and image manipulation, outweighs the internal validation. The discrepancy arises from a focus on purely visual elements versus a deeper semantic and contextual analysis.  The image, while showing Clinton and Trump, is divorced from the caption's false narrative. The meme uses a real photograph but alters the meaning by combining it with a false statement. Therefore, the caption is out of context because the implied relationship between the image (a seemingly amicable appearance together) and the claim that Clinton 'got her wish' in Trump's candidacy is completely false and misleading.  This misrepresentation is explicitly confirmed by Snopes' fact-checking, which thoroughly debunks the quote's authenticity and clarifies the manipulated image source.  Considering that the original caption's core assertion is deemed false and misleading, and the image's context is deliberately manipulated, it's concluded that the caption is demonstrably out of context, regardless of the internal assessment focusing solely on visual elements.",

        "content": "When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., shared a newsletter with constituents recently, she made the first item of business federal marijuana policy.\nIn the Feb. 3 newsletter, Gillibrand wrote that \"marijuana is currently classified in the same category of drugs as heroin and a more dangerous category than fentanyl or cocaine.\"\nGillibrand is correct about marijuanas federal status. That decades-old classification clashes with the drugs widespread state-level legalization in recent years.\nFour states fully outlaw marijuana for medical or recreational use: Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina and Wyoming. Seven more states allow the marijuana derivative CBD but not marijuana itself.\nBy contrast, every other state has fully legalized marijuana for recreational and/or medical use or removed criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug.\nSo, why does the federal government still consider marijuana to \"have no medical use\" and believe it has \"the highest potential for disorder and abuse\"?\nMarijuana as a Schedule I drug\nThe federal governments schedule system stems from the Controlled Substances Act, which was enacted in 1970. The schedules run from 1 (for drugs that have the most serious risk of abuse) down to 5 (which are the least likely to be misused).\nGillibrand is correct that cocaine and fentanyl both fall within Schedule 2, which covers drugs \"considered dangerous\" and have \"a high potential for abuse.\" Under federal scheduling, the legitimate medical use for cocaine is that it can be used during certain eye surgeries under controlled dosages.\nHeroin, meanwhile, is considered a Schedule 1 drug, along with marijuana. Other Schedule 1 drugs include LSD and ecstasy.\nAlthough states have increasingly passed laws to legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use, fatal poisonings from fentanyl have skyrocketed, particularly from contamination within other dangerous drugs.\nPolitiFact recently rated True the statement that the United States has seen \"more Americans die of fentanyl than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars, combined.\"\nStill, marijuana is more potent than it used to be, with the highest concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive ingredient, found in concentrated cannabis products. Marijuana potency has increased from 4% THC in 1995 to 17% in 2017, and at one dispensary in California, a strain of cannabis that could be smoked had 41% THC, according to KFF Health News.\nWhat does Gillibrand support?\nGillibrands office told PolitiFact she supports a full descheduling of marijuana but would also consider a rescheduling to a lower level as an alternative.\nGillibrand was one of eight co-sponsors of the Marijuana Justice Act, which several Democratic senators introduced in the 2019-20 congressional session. The bill would have removed marijuana from the list of controlled substances. Her office added that moving marijuana away from Schedule 1 would enable more research, because Schedule 1 drugs are subject to greater restrictions on medical and scientific study.\nGillibrand also argues that changing marijuanas status would help ease operations for marijuana-based businesses and unclog court dockets.\nWhat is the outlook for federal rescheduling or descheduling?\nMason Tvert, a marijuana policy specialist with VSStrategies, a Denver-based cannabis consulting company, said the federal government has already taken limited steps toward rescheduling marijuana.\nIn August 2023, the federal Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration reschedule cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3, though the recommendations full text was not released. In January, the department released a 252-page, unredacted copy of the text in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\nSchedule 3 would put marijuana on par with some dosages of codeine, as well as ketamine, anabolic steroids and testosterone.\nThis marked the first time in history that any federal agency had publicly acknowledged cannabis as having an accepted medical use and relatively low potential for abuse.\nEven so, Jonathan Caulkins, who studies drug policy at Carnegie Mellon University, told PolitiFact he doesnt expect rescheduling to happen soon.\nIf marijuana were to be rescheduled, then every distributor would have to be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Caulkins said. This would be a challenge, he said, given variations in the strains of marijuana and the lack of a \"baseline\" version under the law.\nTvert acknowledged that rescheduling might drag further because of this.\nIf DEA agreed with the recommendation, the agency would have to publish a proposed rule to reschedule cannabis. That would start a rulemaking process with as much as a 60-day public comment period.\nA bigger bottleneck, he said, would come in the courts, as people request administrative hearings; clearing these could take months. All told, rescheduling could take a year or longer, and if President Joe Biden loses reelection, his successor could shelve the process.\nOur ruling\nGillibrand said, \"Marijuana is currently classified in the same category of drugs as heroin and a more dangerous category than fentanyl or cocaine.\"\nGillibrand is correct that the federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, which means it is considered a greater concern than either fentanyl or cocaine, which are classified as Schedule 2 drugs.\nNow that most states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, federal officials are considering rescheduling marijuana to a lower category of concern. However, there is no official timeline for action.\nWe rate the statement True.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that New York state has legalized heroin. This claim is unsupported by the image, which depicts a person appearing to be struggling with drug addiction and holding a syringe.  The image itself provides no information about any legal changes in New York state or anywhere else regarding heroin. The internal validation check correctly identifies this mismatch, assigning a confidence score of 0 because the image contains no reference to the legalization of heroin in New York or any similar information.  The external validation check also finds the caption unsupported. It notes that the provided text in the original news caption is unrelated to the image content; it states that the caption misrepresents the actual news story. The external check's confidence score is also 0, further strengthening the conclusion that the caption is out of context.\n\nThe discrepancies between the image and the caption are significant. The image focuses on the individual's apparent struggle with drug use, whereas the caption makes a broader statement about a state's legalization of a controlled substance. There is no visual or contextual connection between the image and the legalization of heroin. The internal and external checks completely agree that the caption is out of context and completely unrelated to the image. There's no ambiguity or conflicting information to resolve; both checks provide solid support for the caption's falsehood regarding the image context.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is unambiguous: the news caption is entirely out of context with respect to the provided image. The confidence score is high (10 out of 10) because both internal and external checks converge to demonstrate a complete absence of connection between the image content and the caption statement.  There is no visual evidence suggesting heroin use is legal or has recently been legalized. Further, there is no external evidence to support the assertion in the caption. The image merely depicts the apparent suffering of a person who seems to be abusing drugs.  The news caption has no logical or visual basis within the context of the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the news caption is completely out of context with the provided image.  The image shows a person apparently using drugs, while the caption discusses a state's legalization of heroinâ€”a completely unrelated topic.  The confidence score is 10/10 due to the complete lack of any connection."

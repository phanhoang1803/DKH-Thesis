        "content": "A big red bus emblazoned with the words we send the EU 350m a week, lets fund our NHS instead is credited as being decisive in Britains vote to leave the EU last year.\nIt promised  in absolute terms  financial gains for the British public if they voted to leave, a stark counterweight to a majority of economists who warned that a departure would hurt Britain. The pre-referendum estimates of the long-term pain ranged from a hit to the economy of 1 per cent to 9 per cent of national income  an annual loss of gross domestic product of between 20bn and 180bn compared with remaining in the EU.\nThe Leave campaign won the battle of the slogans, and the referendum. But who is winning the economic argument? Almost 18 months on from the Brexit vote and with 15 months of detailed UK data, it is now possible to begin to answer that important question.\nEconomists for Brexit, a forecasting group, predicted that after a leave vote growth in GDP would expand 2.7 per cent in 2017. The Treasury expected a mild recession. Neither proved correct. The 2017 growth rate appears likely to slow to 1.5 per cent at a time when the global economy is strengthening.\nAccording to economists such as Robert Chote, chairman of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces the official government forecasts, a more pressing question is to assess the impact compared with what would have happened had the vote gone the other way. Many PhDs are going to be written on the impact of Brexit over the years to come, he says.\nThis work has started, and includes a range of estimates calculated by the Financial Times suggesting that the value of Britains output is now around 0.9 per cent lower than was possible if the country had voted to stay in the EU. That equates to almost exactly 350m a week lost to the British economy  an irony that will not be lost on those who may have backed Leave because of the claim made on the side of the bus.\nJonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at Kings College London and one of the academics leading publicly funded research into the effects of Brexit, says: The conclusion that, very roughly, Brexit has already reduced UK growth by 1 per cent or slightly less seems clear.\nCompanies are becoming more vocal over the economic hit, blaming the governments slow handling of the Brexit negotiations for a weaker business climate. In October, the International Monetary Fund highlighted Britain as a notable exception to an improving global economic outlook, while the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations, has raised concerns about the ongoing slowdown in the economy induced by Brexit.\nThomas Sampson and colleagues at the London School of Economics have examined the direct effect of sterlings depreciation since the EU referendum on prices and living standards. With the pound falling about 10 per cent following the June 2016 result, inflation has risen more in Britain than in other advanced economies. It started with petrol prices and spread to food and other goods, pushing overall inflation up from 0.4 per cent at the time of the referendum to 3.1 per cent last month.\nWhen looking at prices, depending on the level of import exposure of different goods and services, the LSE study estimates that the Brexit vote directly increased inflation by 1.7 percentage points of the 2.7 percentage-point rise in the 12 months after the referendum. And with wage inflation stuck at just over 2 per cent, the increase in inflation caused by the Leave vote has already hurt UK households, Mr Sampson says.\nHe calculates that the Brexit vote has cost the average worker almost one weeks wages, but adds the figure could be higher or lower if a complete evaluation of the economic impact was applied rather than just the initial squeeze on incomes from leaving the EU.\nOther effects are more apparent. Business investment grew at an annual rate of 1.3 per cent in the third quarter, compared with a March 2016 official forecast for annual growth of 6.1 per cent for the whole of 2017. Exports, boosted by sterlings depreciation, have proved more resilient. The OBR now expects a 5.2 per cent rise in the volume of goods and services sold abroad in 2017 compared with a pre-referendum prediction of 2.7 per cent.\nNet migration to the UK from the EU fell by 40 per cent in the first 12 months after the vote. Professor Portes last year predicted an ultimate decline of between 50 and 85 per cent on net migration levels before the referendum. Arithmetically, this reduction [of 40 per cent] of net EU migration translates into a reduction in growth of 0.1 to 0.2 per cent, he says.\nEconomists working to estimate the overall Brexit impact on the economy need to build a counterfactual scenario  an imagined world in which Britain had voted to remain in the EU  to compare that with Britains economic performance since the vote. The counterfactual cannot be known for certain but it is possible to take a number of approaches, in three broad categories.\nThe first is to compare recent UK economic performance with its past. A worse performance than the UK has achieved over long historical periods or in recent years would support the view that the vote has hurt economic performance. But a shortcoming of this approach is that if the past year was always likely to be rather weak, this method could suggest a Brexit hit when there was none.\nComparing the UK performance with that of other countries is another option. Using its normal position in the G7 league table of leading economies is one possible technique, as is contrasting UK performance with the average of similar economies. A more sophisticated approach is to use a statistical algorithm to devise a historically accurate set of comparator countries, a method recently performed by a group of academics from the universities of Bonn, Tbingen and Oxford. These geographical techniques often smooth out concerns that the recent period might be unusual, but they are vulnerable to variations in other countries, such as a sudden boom in the eurozone that Britain was never likely to match.\nA third tactic is to look at forecasts made for Britains economy before the referendum on the basis of staying in the EU and compare the actual outcome with these prior forecasts. Its weakness is that there was a wide range of pre-referendum forecasts, while its strength is that the figures reflect the best knowledge available at the time.\nJagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, says each of the methods are reasonable for generating an estimate of the impact of Brexit so far. We cant know how the [UK] economy would have responded to the news over the past 18 months, but there have not been any large shocks and the rest of the world has done slightly better than we thought likely a year ago.\nThe results vary according to the comparisons made, but all show the UK economy has been damaged even before it formally leaves the EU on March 29 2019.\nWhen the past five quarters are judged against the UKs historical average growth rate, the 1.9 per cent expansion in GDP achieved between the second quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017 is lower than history would suggest is normal for the UK economy.\nDepending on the period of comparison chosen, the UK economy would normally have been expected to expand by between 2.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent over the same period. The lower end of the range comes from more recent history, such as the average since a Conservative-led government came to office in 2010, while the upper boundary reflects Britains long-term performance in the 30 years before the financial crisis. The hit to the economy on this comparison is between 0.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent of national income.\nGeographical comparisons produce a similar conclusion. Britains year-on-year growth rate tended to be close to the G7 upper range of outcomes over the past 25 years. Had that performance continued, British GDP would have grown 2.9 per cent since the referendum. The statistical algorithm produces a significantly larger estimate of what would have been possible, suggesting Brexit has already removed 1.3 per cent from GDP since the vote.\nThis equates British performance to a weighted average of other countries, with the US, Canada, Japan and Hungary having the largest weights. Asked whether it was reasonable to judge the UKs performance against that of Hungary, Professor Moritz Schularick of Bonn University says, like the UK, Hungary is a European economy and integrated into the production chains, but remained outside the eurozone with a floating exchange rate and therefore could use monetary policy more aggressively after the crisis.\nEstimates using pre-referendum forecasts provide a range within almost the exact same boundaries  between 0.6 per cent of GDP and 1.1 per cent. The larger figure is based on analysis from Economists for Brexit, which initially predicted strong growth after the vote.\nProfessor Patrick Minford, who carried out the forecasts for the group, blames Office for National Statistics productivity estimates, [which] are not convincing because they have made no real attempt to estimate the growth in quality of services, such as in education and healthcare. But all of this was known before the referendum.\nOverall, 14 different counterfactuals estimated by the FT and others give a range of a hit between 0.6 per cent of national income and 1.3 per cent, with an average of 0.9 per cent. With national income of 2tn in the year ending in the third quarter of 2017, it means the UK is likely to be producing 18bn less a year than would have been reasonable to expect and this is directly attributable to Britains decision to leave the EU. That is just short of 350m a week.\nBrexit-supporting economists say the figures are reasonable. Julian Jessop, head of the Brexit unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs, says: Lots of sensible Brexiters accept there will be a short-term hit and it is unarguable that the economy is weaker than it would have been, I would say between 0.5 and 1 per cent weaker. As for the longer term, its all to play for. Brexit creates lots of opportunities, it is for the government to make the most of them.\nIn the referendum campaign the big red bus was making a different comparison, an incorrect one, about the budgetary costs of the EU to Britain. It suggested Britain contributes almost 18bn a year to the budget, when the net cost in 2016 was calculated by the Treasury to be 8.6bn. And this leaves one last comparison that it is possible to make.\nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says that for every 1 per cent of GDP you lose, thats getting on for 10bn a year of foregone tax revenues. If 0.9 per cent of GDP has been lost over the five quarters for which data exists, there has already been a 9bn hit to the public finances. So even before the UK has left the EU, the referendum result is costing the UK government more than can possibly be recovered by ending net contributions to Brussels.\nHow the Brexit vote has hit the economy\n0% - The average worker\nAfter taking inflation into account, pay including bonuses for the average worker in October 2017 was 490 a week. Official figures show that in May 2016 before the EU referendum it was 491, so real pay levels have been flat. This squeeze on real incomes has constrained consumer spending growth and it has increased only because employment has risen and household savings rates have fallen.\n<11.5% - A company contemplating investment\nUncertainty over future trading relations with the EU has led companies to postpone some investment projects. Purchases of lorries, vans and other transport equipment in the third quarter of 2017 were down 11.8 per cent on the same period a year earlier, limiting the contribution investment made towards economic growth. The Bank of Englands regional agents report that uncertainties over the UKs trading tiescontinued to deter investment for some firms.\n>1.5% - A retailer facing a tougher trading environment\nSales in John Lewis, the department store favoured by Britains middle classes, have been 1.5 per cent higher in the second half of 2017 than in2016. With inflation at 3.1 per cent, this implies a decrease in the volume of goods purchased. To gauge what was possible at this most robust of UK retailers, the equivalent sales growth in the second half of 2016 was 3 per cent, which at the time was well above the 1.2 per cent level of inflation\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018. All rights reserved.\nWhen Greenland left the European Community in the 1980s, the legacy rights of expatriate citizens were guaranteed with a legal act of extraordinary simplicity: the operative article runs to just 85 words.\nThe fate of 4m EU and British expatriates looks far more uncertain and complex. One senior Brexit negotiator fears talks on citizen rights could sink into a horrible legal morass.\nIts immense. Every time you think youre across it, you turn another corner and find another mess, said another senior EU diplomat.\nBoth London and the EU-27 agree on a broad goal: a reciprocal deal to guarantee the rights of 3m EU citizens in Britain, and about 1m British expats within the union. But within the detail of that superficial agreement lies an expat lifetimes worth of politically sensitive choices.\nResidence definitions, pension rights, unborn children, the ability to move, claim benefits, marry, divorce, even commit crime and avoid deportation  an entire cycle of modern life is potentially touched by the Brexit agreement.\nWe cant hide the fact that it is complex, said Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliaments chief Brexit negotiator.\nBut if we base ourselves on the principles of reciprocity and a uniform approach by the EU-27 then in my view there is no reason why we cannot find a lasting and equitable solution.\nHere the Financial Times runs through seven obstacles to a deal.\nNothing can be taken for granted\nThere is no systematic register of when expats arrived in their current place of residence. Worse still, EU officials think it is not feasible to create a comprehensive one before the expected Brexit date in 2019. So even if some rights are guaranteed, citizens will need to prove eligibility. Britains 85-page residency form offers an insight on the bureaucracy ahead.\nNot all expats are the same\nNo British politician has questioned the right to remain of legitimate EU migrants. But that is only one small sliver of EU citizen rights. At issue are work rights, welfare access, health provision, discounted student fees, even the ability to draw a UK state pension 50 years from now. And these rights depend on circumstances.\nUnder EU law, migrant workers have different rights to students, pensioners or jobseekers. Residing in a country for more than five years  and thereby gaining permanent residence  is an important threshold for gaining rights. But decisions will depend on proof.\nCircumstances change\nManaging change will be hard. If an expat marries, what rights would their partner enjoy, and would their nationality matter? Could they bring in-laws to the country? Similarly an expats legal status may evolve over time, should they lose their job or move country.\nThe law, too, will evolve. The EU may legislate to change rights post-Brexit. EU nationals may want to challenge Britains application of their rights. Would that be in British courts or European courts? And whose interpretation of EU law would prevail? A big role for European courts would cross a red line for London.\nThe two sides want to guarantee different rights\nThe EU-27 want to maintain full rights for EU expats but this could be tricky for Theresa May, the prime minister. If existing welfare rights remain intact, for instance, EU migrants could still claim UK child benefit for dependants in Paris or Warsaw  long a British tabloid bugbear. Full EU rights would also restrict Britains ability to deport an EU migrant who has committed crimes after Brexit.\nA third example is pensions. At present a Brit moving to Australia can draw their UK state pension, but it would be frozen, and not increased in line with inflation and earnings. A Slovak or German migrant worker who leaves Britain, by contrast, would enjoy better rights: their full UK pension drawn overseas and uprated every year.\nThere may need to be dozens of deals\nBrexit poses two questions on citizen rights: the legacy rights of current expats and what terms future expats may enjoy.\nBritain may seek to tackle both in one deal  reciprocated by the EU. That would apply a single, probably less generous, regime of rights to all present and future EU migrants, covering health, benefits and citizenship.\nPotential problems will arise from watering down EU rights. That is because the EU-27s first and foremost concern is preserving full rights for the existing 3m migrants, rather than future flows.\nDepart too much from the EUs legal baseline and EU negotiators warn a citizen rights deal may not be possible under the Article 50 exit clause. Instead country-by-country bilateral deals may be necessary with each of the 27 members. That is hard to negotiate and ratify, and even harder for expats to understand and apply.\nBeware the cut-off point\nNo Brexit deal on rights can be open-ended. Negotiators are looking at various cut-off points: the lifetime of the eligible expats; a period of time, say five or 10 years; or until the point at which the expat gives up their enhanced rights by moving country. All three options have political and technical upsides and downsides.\nOne complication is that some rights, such as pensions, will be for life and even cover former expats. Then there is the eligibility date. British ministers want to draw a line on EU free movement rights and are looking at three options: the point of the Brexit referendum, the Article 50 notification, or Britains exit. EU-27 negotiators see nothing to discuss: EU rights and obligations continue until the point Britain leaves.\nEarly, late or hard?\nExpat rights will be one of the first topics to be discussed in Brexit talks. Both sides want a quick deal but that may be impossible. Diplomats are scrambling to work out what would happen in the event of no deal. Expats would basically be at the mercy of national governments.\nBut there are some protections. EU law does cover safeguard rights for some third-country nationals. And a raft of dormant UK bilateral agreements with European countries on welfare  superseded by EU membership  may be revived. One such agreement dug up: a 1923 Anglo-Finnish treaty on the disposal of the estates of deceased seamen.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018. All rights reserved.\nPressure has been growing in the past few weeks for politicians and regulators to clamp down on the monopoly power of Big Tech. In a speech given in Washington DC on September 12, Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, tried to pour cold water on the idea. Given the clear consumer benefits of technology-driven innovation, she said. I am concerned about the push to adopt an approach that will disregard consumer benefits in the pursuit of other, perhaps even conflicting, goals.\"\nHer words echo US antitrust policy of the past 40 years: if companies bring down prices for consumers, they can be as big and as powerful, economically and politically, as they want to be. This hugely favours companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, which offer up services and products, from search results to self-publishing platforms, that are not just cheap, but free.\nYet Ms Ohlhausen is overlooking a key point: free is not free when you consider that we are not paying for these services in dollars, but in data, including everything from our credit card numbers to shopping records, to political choices and medical histories. How valuable is that personal data?\nIt is a question of growing interest to everyone from economists to artists. For example, at Datenmarkt, an art installation cum grocery store set up in Hamburg in 2014, a can of fruit sold for five Facebook photos; a pack of toast for eight likes and so on.\nThe bottom line is that it is almost impossible to put an exact price on personal data, in part because people have widely varying behaviours and ideas about how likely they are to part with it, depending on how offers are posed. In one recent study, when consumers were asked straight out whether they would consent to being tracked by a brand name digital media firm in exchange for being targeted with more useful advertising, four-fifths said no. Yet another study published this year by researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University shows how pathetically little incentive is required to convince people to give up their entire email contact list. Students in the study were far more likely to do it if offered a free pizza.\nOne might argue that this is simply the market working as it should. Consumers were given a choice, and they made it. And whether or not it was a bad one is not for us to judge.\nBut as the latter study also showed, companies can nudge users to part with data more freely by telling them it will be protected by technology designed to keep the prying eyes of everyone from governments to internet service providers . . . from seeing the content of messages. In fact, the encryption technology in question could not guarantee this.\nThe bottom line is that big data tilts the playing field decisively in favour of the largest digital players themselves. They can extract information and plant suggestions there that will lead us to entirely different decisions, which results in ever more profit for them.\nNot only is that too much power for any one company to have, it is anti-competitive and market-distorting in the sense that the basic rules of capitalism as we know it are being overturned. There is no equal access to market information in this scenario. There is certainly no price transparency.\nThe personal data we give away so freely are being lavishly monetised by the richest companies on the planet (Facebooks second-quarter operating margin, for example, was 47.2 per cent). They get their raw material (our data) more or less for free, then charge retailers and advertisers for it, who then pass those costs on to us in one form or another  a dollar more for that glass of wine at the bistro you found via a search, say. They have a licence to print money, without many of the restrictions, in terms of all sorts of corporate liability, that other industries have to grapple with.\nThese companies are not so much innovators as attention merchants, to borrow a phrase from Columbia University law school professor Tim Wu. Economists have yet to put good figures on their net effect on productivity and gross domestic product growth. Surely it is high. Yet any tally would also have to include the competition costs as these firms devour competitors and reshape the 21st-century economy to suit themselves.\nWhatever the FTC might say now, there are a growing number of legal cases that could change the ground rules for Big Tech. While American antitrust law has been based on very literal interpretations of the 1890 Sherman Act, lawmakers in Europe take a broader approach. They are trying to gauge how multiple players in the economic ecosystem are being affected by the digital giants.\nI am beginning to wonder if we should not all have a more explicit right not only to control how our data are used, but to any economic value created from them. When wealth lives mainly in intellectual property, it is hard to imagine how else the maths will work. We are living in a brave new world, with an entirely new currency. It will require creative thinking  economically, legally and politically  to ensure it does not become a winner-takes-all society.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018. All rights reserved.\nAmazon executives will not be present on Tuesday when three other major internet companies endure a grilling before Congress. But it may just be a matter of time before Washingtons new appetite for regulating the digital economy reaches the e-commerce giant.\nLawyers for Google, Facebook and Twitter will occupy this weeks spotlight in front of the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees, which are probing the companies unwitting role in Russias 2016 election meddling. Already, there is talk of legislation requiring them to disclose more about their operations.\nThe controversy over the industrys dissemination of Russian fake news highlights a broader souring of attitudes toward the online platforms, triggered by unease over their sheer size and power, which spans the political spectrum. From progressives like Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senators, to Steve Bannon, President Donald Trumps former chief strategist, who runs the nationalist media site Breitbart, there is growing support for reining in, or even breaking up, the digital groups that dominate the US economy.\nThe worm has turned, says Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and author of The Four: the Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. No doubt about it.\nThough unaffected by the Russia allegations Amazon  whose $136bn in revenues last year topped the combined sales of Google parent Alphabet and Facebook  is a target of demands for more assertive antitrust enforcement. Its dominance has also raised questions about whether existing legislation needs to be rewritten for the internet age.\nThe online retailers relentless expansion into new businesses, including groceries and small business lending, and its control of data on the millions of third-party vendors that use its sales platform, warehouses and delivery services, have some analysts likening it to a 21st century version of the corporate trusts such as Standard Oil that throttled American competition a century ago.\nAmazon has big antitrust problems in its future, says Scott Cleland, a technology policy official in the George HW Bush administration and president of Precursor, a research consultancy. If there is a minimally interested, fair-minded antitrust effort in the Trump administration, Amazons got trouble.\nFor now, Mr Clelands remains a minority view. Most experts say the company has yet to engage in the classic anti-competitive behaviour that the antitrust laws are designed to prevent. Under the prevailing interpretation of this doctrine, which prizes consumer welfare above all else, champion price-cutter Amazon has little reason to worry. Indeed, US regulators this summer performed only a brief review before approving Amazons nearly $14bn acquisition of the upmarket grocer Whole Foods.\nAmazon and the other platforms remain popular with consumers, thanks to their low prices or free services. But companies that were once seen as avatars of American innovation and achievement are now increasingly treated with scepticism. Mr Bannon has said that companies such as Google and Facebook are so essential to daily life that they should be regulated as public utilities.\nThe digital platforms dominate the economy and their respective markets like few businesses in the modern era, says the bipartisan New Center project of Republican William Kristol and Democrat Bill Galston. It notes that nearly half of all e-commerce passes through Amazon while Facebook controls 77 per cent of mobile social traffic and Google has 81 per cent of the search engine market.\nThe online retailer stands alone in its cross-market reach, dominating product search, hardware and cloud computing while also serving as an indispensable conduit for other vendors to reach consumers, says Mr Galloway. Last year, 55 per cent of product searches began on Amazon, topping Google.\nTheyre winning at everything, he says. This company is firing on all 12,000 cylinders.\nYet even as calls to break up the nations big banks after the global financial crisis have faded, talk that the digital giants have grown too large gets ever louder. The downside of economic concentration features prominently in the Democratic partys Better Deal programme for the 2018 Congressional elections. It calls for an intensification in antitrust enforcement and blames stagnant wages, rising prices and disappointing growth on insufficient competition.\nAn anti-monopoly push will almost certainly be a major part of the 2020 presidential campaign, predicts Barry Lynn of the Open Markets initiative.\nSilicon Valleys tradition of funding the party could complicate the Democrats anti-monopoly push. In the 2016 election, the internet industry gave 74 per cent of its $12.3m in congressional campaign contributions to Democrats. Internet company executives and their corporate political action committees, which pool individual contributions in accord with the federal prohibition on direct corporate political spending, also gave Hillary Clintons campaign more than $6.3m while Mr Trump pulled in less than $100,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nIndividuals and the PACs associated with Google parent Alphabet topped the industrys list of total political contributors with $8.1m while Amazon ranked fourth with about $1.4m.\nAmazon in numbers\n542,000\nThe number of Amazon employees\n17,000\nThe number of people who worked for the group in 2007\n$2.4bn\nThird-quarter revenues from subscription services including Amazon Prime\n$1.4m\nAmazons contribution to the 2016 US congressional campaigns. Overall the internet industry donated $12.2m  74% went to Democrats\n$13m\nThe amount Amazon is on track to spend on political lobbying this year. Up from $2.5m five years ago\nAmazon has moved a long way from its roots since launching two decades ago to sell books and nothing but books. Now, it sells just about everything to everybody: nearly 400m products including its own batteries, shirts and baby wipes. It operates a media studio and provides cloud computing space to customers such as the Central Intelligence Agency while running the Marketplace sales platform for other vendors, a delivery and logistics network and a payment service. The company Jeff Bezos launched in 1994 also now makes popular electronics, including the Kindle ereader and the Alexa voice-activated device.\nIts growth has been astronomical. Amazon expects to record at least $173bn in annual sales this year  that would nearly double its 2014 figure. It employs 542,000 workers, more than twice its mid-2016 payroll, thanks in part to the Whole Foods deal, and its $1,100 share price has roughly doubled in just 20 months.\nBy almost any measure, Amazon is a fantastically successful company. Maybe too successful, its detractors say. Mr Trump has periodically suggested antitrust action against the online giant, saying of Mr Bezos last year: Hes got a huge antitrust problem because hes controlling so much; Amazon is controlling so much.\nIn August, the president returned to the subject, taking aim at the companys impact on bricks-and-mortar retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the US are being hurt  many jobs being lost! he tweeted.\nStill, most politicians regard Amazon as a potential economic boon. Some 238 communities answered the companys request to identify sites for its planned second headquarters. It is not hard to see why: the $5bn project will directly create work for 50,000 people, plus tens of thousands of additional jobs and tens of billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community, Amazon says.\nEven critics of the companys size, such as Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, overcame their concerns. Amazon would make the right business choice by coming here, Mr Booker told a press conference last month in Newark.\nAmazon, which declined to comment for this story, recognises its potential political problem. The company is on track to spend nearly $13m this year on lobbying the federal government compared with just $2.5m five years ago. In 2016 it added an antitrust lawyer, Seth Bloom, with experience on Capitol Hill and in the justice department.\nThough the Trump administration approved the Whole Foods purchase, Amazons antitrust concerns have not evaporated. Congressman Keith Ellison, deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who favours a break-up of all the digital players, says the online retailer should spin off its $12bn-a-year cloud computing business known as Amazon Web Services.\nI do think they should be forced to sell off huge parts, he says. Theyre too big.\nThe view is echoed by Mr Kristol, a prominent former official in the Reagan and George HW Bush administrations, who says the tech giants dominance hurts workers, consumers and the overall economy. His New Center project, aimed at overcoming political polarisation, supports tougher antitrust enforcement to address monopolistic behaviour in the technology sector.\nEven among pro-market conservatives, sentiment is shifting on the need for greater government intervention. People are at least open to the argument that concentration of power is a problem even if theres no immediate cost paid by consumers, Mr Kristol says.\nUS law does not prohibit monopolies so long as they arise through legitimate means. But companies are not permitted to exploit their dominance in one market to control another.\nCompetition authorities in the EU have moved more aggressively to corral the internet groups. Earlier this month the EU ordered Amazon to pay $290m in back taxes to Luxembourg after Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief, said the online retailer had benefited from special treatment.\nMs Vestager has also gone after American internet companies on antitrust grounds, levying a 2.4bn fine on Google in June and reaching a negotiated settlement with Amazon over its ebook distribution contracts. In May, Amazon agreed to scrap contract clauses requiring publishers to offer it terms that were as good or better than those offered to its competitors.\nAmazons critics say that its role as an essential e-commerce platform for more than 2m other vendors and its control of data on their sales warrant government action. Last year, in a speech that ignited the Democrats renewed interest in anti-monopoly efforts, Ms Warren said companies like Amazon provide a platform that lots of other companies depend on for survival, adding, the platform can become a tool to snuff out competition. For its part, Amazon says it faces intense competition.\nCritics remain unconvinced. Its control over a vast cache of customer data gives it unprecedented . . . advantages in penetrating new industries and new markets, according to Amir Konigsberg, chief executive and co-founder of Twiggle, which sells search and analytics software to Amazon competitors.\nTheres no question that the company has grown through innovation and by meeting customer needs. But gobbling up rivals and would-be rivals has also been part of the equation. Since 2005, Amazon has acquired more than 60 companies including some that were at first reluctant to sell, such as Zappos, the online shoe retailer.\nIts a dominant platform and a vertically integrated dominant platform, says Lina Khan, author of an influential Yale Law Journal article earlier this year that ignited the debate. It acts as a gatekeeper . . . Its closing off the market to new entrants.\nMs Khan says Amazon also has priced goods and services  such as its unlimited two-day Amazon Prime delivery service  below cost. By prioritising growth over profits, the company has unfairly squeezed competitors, she says.\nThough Mr Cleland says antitrust enforcers could make a case against Amazon under the prevailing interpretation of US law, most analysts say a genuine push to break up or constrain the tech giants requires rethinking the antitrust orthodoxy of the past 40 years. The so-called Chicago School of antitrust theory, which focuses on consumer prices and innovation, is ill-equipped to cope with the internet worlds structural tendency to produce winner-takes-all outcomes.\nThe rhetoric around consumer prices can disable antitrust law, says Ms Khan. These platforms present new issues.\nAntitrust: Consumer first laws favour Amazon\nIt is almost four decades since Robert Bork, a one-time Supreme Court nominee, wrote the book that defines US competition policy to this day.\nMr Bork, a Yale University law professor, relied on Chicago school economics to argue in The Antitrust Paradox that safeguarding consumer welfare, not preventing excessive corporate size, should be the goal of antitrust enforcement. Ever since, US antitrust enforcers have concentrated on businesses impact on prices and choice  unlike in Europe, where regulators seek to preserve robust competition.\nBut some analysts say that the Chicago school approach is outdated in a data-rich internet age which encourages natural monopolies. The consumer welfare standard has facilitated the emergence of companies like Amazon, which use economies of scale and remorseless efficiency to drive down prices, and Google and Facebook, which benefit from network effects that promote low-cost expansion.\nThe rise of the online retailer is an almost poetic illustration of the shortcomings of current antitrust law, says Lina Khan, who countered Mr Bork earlier this year in an influential law journal article entitled Amazons Antitrust Paradox.\nThe prevailing antitrust approach does not recognise Amazons ability to crush competitors by pricing goods below cost and to exploit its power in one sector to gain market share in another, Ms Khan argues.\nAmazon has used its heft to extract discounts of up to 70 per cent from delivery companies such as UPS, which in turn makes its own fulfilment service all but irresistible to other retailers, Ms Khan says. Its rivals can either try to compete with Amazon at a disadvantage or become reliant on a competitor to handle delivery and logistics, she wrote.\nBut Amazons critics have so far been more persuasive politically than legally, says Diana Moss of the non-profit American Antitrust Institute. They have not yet articulated a coherent case that would gain traction with enforcers and the courts, she says. Thats a heavy lift.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018. All rights reserved.\nIt is not true that humanity cannot learn from history. It can and, in the case of the lessons of the dark period between 1914 and 1945, the west did. But it seems to have forgotten those lessons. We are living, once again, in an era of strident nationalism and xenophobia. The hopes of a brave new world of progress, harmony and democracy, raised by the market opening of the 1980s and the collapse of Soviet communism between 1989 and 1991, have turned into ashes.\nWhat lies ahead for the US, creator and guarantor of the postwar liberal order, soon to be governed by a president who repudiates permanent alliances, embraces protectionism and admires despots? What lies ahead for a battered EU, contemplating the rise of illiberal democracy in the east, Brexit and the possibility of Marine Le Pens election to the French presidency?\nWhat lies ahead now that Vladimir Putins irredentist Russia exerts increasing influence on the world and China has announced that Xi Jinping is not first among equals but a core leader?\nThe contemporary global economic and political system originated as a reaction against the disasters of the first half of the 20th century. The latter, in turn, were caused by the unprecedented, but highly uneven, economic progress of the 19th century.\nThe transformational forces unleashed by industrialisation stimulated class conflict, nationalism and imperialism. Between 1914 and 1918, industrialised warfare and the Bolshevik revolution ensued. The attempted restoration of the pre-first world war liberal order in the 1920s ended with the Great Depression, the triumph of Adolf Hitler and the Japanese militarism of the 1930s. This then created the conditions for the catastrophic slaughter of the second world war, to be followed by the communist revolution in China.\nIn the aftermath of the second world war, the world was divided between two camps: liberal democracy and communism. The US, the worlds dominant economic power, led the former and the Soviet Union the latter. With US encouragement, the empires controlled by enfeebled European states disintegrated, creating a host of new countries in what was called the third world.\nContemplating the ruins of European civilisation and the threat from communist totalitarianism, the US, the worlds most prosperous economy and militarily powerful country, used not only its wealth but also its example of democratic self-government, to create, inspire and underpin a transatlantic west. In so doing, its leaders consciously learnt from the disastrous political and economic mistakes their predecessors made after its entry into the first world war in 1917.\nDomestically, the countries of this new west emerged from the second world war with a commitment to full employment and some form of welfare state. Internationally, a new set of institutions  the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (ancestor of todays World Trade Organisation) and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (the instrument of the Marshall Plan, later renamed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)  oversaw the reconstruction of Europe and promoted global economic development. Nato, the core of the western security system, was founded in 1949. The Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, forefather of the EU, was signed in 1957.\nThis creative activity came partly in response to immediate pressures, notably the postwar European economic misery and the threat from Stalins Soviet Union. But it also reflected a vision of a more co-operative world.\nFrom euphoria to disappointment\nEconomically, the postwar era can be divided into two periods: the Keynesian period of European and Japanese economic catch-up and the subsequent period of market-oriented globalisation, which began with Deng Xiaopings reforms in China from 1978 and the elections in the UK and US of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in 1979 and 1980 respectively.\nThis latter period was characterised by completion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994, establishment of the WTO in 1995, Chinas entry into the WTO in 2001 and the enlargement of the EU, to include former members of the Warsaw Pact, in 2004.\nThe first economic period ended in the great inflation of the 1970s. The second period ended with the western financial crisis of 2007-09. Between these two periods lay a time of economic turmoil and uncertainty, as is true again now. The main economic threat in the first period of transition was inflation. This time, it has been disinflation.\nGeopolitically, the postwar era can also be divided into two periods: the cold war, which ended with the Soviet Unions fall in 1991, and the post-cold war era. The US fought significant wars in both periods: the Korean (1950-53) and Vietnam (1963-1975) wars during the first, and the two Gulf wars (1990-91 and 2003) during the second. But no war was fought among economically advanced great powers, though that came very close during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.\nThe first geopolitical period of the postwar era ended in disappointment for the Soviets and euphoria in the west. Today, it is the west that confronts geopolitical and economic disappointment.\nThe Middle East is in turmoil. Mass migration has become a threat to European stability. Mr Putins Russia is on the march. Mr Xis China is increasingly assertive. The west seems impotent.\nThese geopolitical shifts are, in part, the result of desirable changes, notably the spread of rapid economic development beyond the west, particularly to the Asian giants, China and India. Some are also the result of choices made elsewhere, not least Russias decision to reject liberal democracy in favour of nationalism and autocracy as the core of its post-communist identity and Chinas to combine a market economy with communist control.\nRising anger\nYet the west also made big mistakes, notably the decision in the aftermath of 9/11 to overthrow Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and spread democracy in the Middle East at gunpoint. In both the US and UK, the Iraq war is now seen as having illegitimate origins, incompetent management and disastrous outcomes.\nWestern economies have also been affected, to varying degrees, by slowing growth, rising inequality, high unemployment (especially in southern Europe), falling labour force participation and deindustrialisation. These shifts have had particularly adverse effects on relatively unskilled men. Anger over mass immigration has grown, particularly in parts of the population also adversely affected by other changes.\nSome of these shifts were the result of economic changes that were either inevitable or the downside of desirable developments. The threat to unskilled workers posed by technology could not be plausibly halted, nor could the rising competitiveness of emerging economies. Yet, in economic policy, too, big mistakes were made, notably the failure to ensure the gains from economic growth were more widely shared. The financial crisis of 2007-09 and subsequent eurozone crisis were, however, the decisive events.\nThese had devastating economic effects: a sudden jump in unemployment followed by relatively weak recoveries. The economies of the advanced countries are roughly a sixth smaller today than they would have been if pre-crisis trends had continued.\nThe response to the crisis also undermined belief in the systems fairness. While ordinary people lost their jobs or their houses, the government bailed out the financial system. In the US, where the free market is a secular faith, this looked particularly immoral.\nFinally, these crises destroyed confidence in the competence and probity of financial, economic and policymaking elites, notably over the management of the financial system and the wisdom of creating the euro.\nAll this together destroyed the bargain on which complex democracies rest, which held that elites could earn vast sums of money or enjoy great influence and power as long as they delivered the goods. Instead, a long period of poor income growth for most of the population, especially in the US, culminated, to almost everyones surprise, in the biggest financial and economic crisis since the 1930s. Now, the shock has given way to fear and rage.\nThe succession of geopolitical and economic blunders has also undermined western states reputation for competence, while raising that of Russia and, still more, China. It has also, with the election of Donald Trump, torn a hole in the threadbare claims of US moral leadership.\nWe are, in short, at the end of both an economic period  that of western-led globalisation  and a geopolitical one  the post-cold war unipolar moment of a US-led global order.\nThe question is whether what follows will be an unravelling of the post-second world war era into deglobalisation and conflict, as happened in the first half of the 20th century, or a new period in which non-western powers, especially China and India, play a bigger role in sustaining a co-operative global order.\nFree trade and prosperity\nA big part of the answer will be provided by western countries. Even now, after a generation of relative economic decline, the US, the EU and Japan produce just over half of world output measured at market prices and 36 per cent of it measured at purchasing power parity.\nThey also remain homes to the worlds most important and innovative companies, dominant financial markets, leading institutions of higher education and most influential cultures. The US should also remain the worlds most powerful country, particularly militarily, for decades. But its ability to influence the world is greatly enhanced by its network of alliances, the product of the creative US statecraft during the early postwar era. Yet alliances also need to be maintained.\nThe essential ingredient in western success must, however, be domestic. Slow growth and ageing populations have put pressure on public spending. With weak growth, particularly of productivity, and structural upheaval in labour markets, politics has taken on zero-sum characteristics: instead of being able to promise more for everybody, it becomes more about taking from some to give to others. The winners in this struggle have been those who are already highly successful. That makes those in the middle and bottom of the income distribution more anxious and so more susceptible to racist and xenophobic demagoguery.\nIn assessing responses, two factors must be remembered.\nFirst, the post-second world war era of US hegemony has been a huge overall success. Global average real incomes per head rose by 460 per cent between 1950 and 2015. The proportion of the worlds population in extreme poverty has fallen from 72 per cent in 1950 to 10 per cent in 2015.\nGlobally, life expectancy at birth has risen from 48 years in 1950 to 71 in 2015. The proportion of the worlds people living in democracies has risen from 31 per cent in 1950 to 56 per cent in 2015.\nSecond, trade has been far from the leading cause of the long-term decline in the proportion of US jobs in manufacturing, though the rise in the trade deficit had a significant effect on employment in manufacturing after 2000. Technologically driven productivity growth has been far more powerful.\nSimilarly, trade has also not been the main cause of rising inequality: after all, high-income economies have all been buffeted by the big shifts in international competitiveness, but the consequences of those shifts for the distribution of income have varied hugely.\nUS and western leaders have to find better ways to satisfy their peoples demands. It looks, however, as though the UK still lacks a clear idea of how it is going to function after Brexit, the eurozone remains fragile, and some of the people Mr Trump plans to appoint, as well as Republicans in Congress, seem determined to slash the frayed cords of the US social safety net.\nA divided, inward-looking and mismanaged west is likely to become highly destabilising. China might then find greatness thrust upon it. Whether it will be able to rise to a new global role, given its huge domestic challenges, is an open question. It seems quite unlikely.\nBy succumbing to the lure of false solutions, born of disillusion and rage, the west might even destroy the intellectual and institutional pillars on which the postwar global economic and political order has rested. It is easy to understand those emotions, while rejecting such simplistic responses. The west will not heal itself by ignoring the lessons of its history. But it could well create havoc in the attempt.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018.

That strategy has been successful in achieving tremendous growth: Ubers revenues were $3.4bn in the first quarter of this year, triple the levels of the year prior.\nDuring the past four quarters revenues were $9.1bn, which is more than Twitter or Tesla, and investors valued the company at $62.5bn last year.\nHowever, the challenge now will be to shift Ubers model from one that has been very successful at revenue growth, to one that is more financially sustainable and, eventually, profitable.\nSome economists say there was no obvious way to do that, even before the extra challenges Uber now faces as the company rebuilds its C-suite and tries to recover from a series of crises, including the resignation of Travis Kalanick as chief executive earlier this week.\nThere is no clear pathway I can see for Uber to go from a high-revenue growth company to a profitable company, says Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business. Normally the story for start-ups is that as revenues grow economies of scale will kick in, but that story is tough to tell with Uber.\nFurthermore the leadership vacuum at Uber has left a question over one of its main advantages, the ability to raise ample money at low cost.\nUber has between $6.5bn and $7bn of unrestricted cash in the bank, with a further $2.3bn untapped line of credit. This could cover the companys cash needs for roughly three more years, extrapolating from its losses during the first quarter of this year.\nUbers path to sustainability will depend on controlling the companys two main costs: the subsidies for drivers and riders, and general costs such as engineering and research and development.\nThese general costs benefit from economies of scale  as Uber grows, the overhead becomes less expensive on a per-ride basis.\nThe subsidies are essential because Uber uses these as levers to maintain a two-sided transportation marketplace, one that balances driver demand and passenger supply. Sign-up bonuses attract new drivers and maintain a sufficient driver pool, while more specific bonuses for certain times and places help steer drivers to places of high demand.\nThese incentive payments typically come down on a per-ride basis as a new market matures. However, the tenacity of Ubers rivals has meant that the company has not been able to eliminate them altogether.\nEven in the US, its biggest and oldest market, Uber was not profitable last year, partly because it had to fight off a fresh push from its smaller rival Lyft.\nThat onslaught has continued this year as Lyft raised fresh funds and benefited from the #DeleteUber campaign: Ubers market share has fallen from 84 per cent at the beginning of the year to 77 per cent at the end of May, according to Second Measure, a research group that analyses credit card data.\nThe fact that switching costs are so low between one service and the other  both drivers and riders can easily flip between the apps  means that it can be hard for Uber to defend its market dominance.\nNevertheless the company did succeed in narrowing its global operating losses in the first quarter of this year to $708m, from $990m the previous quarter.\nOne area where Uber and Lyft have been experimenting with a different revenue model is through subscriptions  offering a monthly membership pack to frequent riders. (One example might be a $20 monthly fee that buys the rider 20 shared rides for $2 each.)\nSubscription models could make sense if  as Uber and Lyft hope  more urban dwellers ditch their private cars and use Uber and Lyft instead, particularly in cities that lack good public transport.\nThe fantasy for both companies is that car-booking usage will surge, making private car ownership a thing of the past (right now ride-hailing accounts for just 0.4 per cent of passenger car miles travelled in the US, so there is still some way to go).\nSubscription models are always very beneficial, says Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners. There is visibility, it is a nice recurring revenue model. To the extent that they can get it, that is great.\nAs their markets begin to mature, investors in both companies have come to believe that ride-hailing is not a winner-take-all market, but rather one in which multiple companies can coexist.\nMitchell Green, an Uber investor and a partner at Lead Edge Capital, says that his thesis is that the ride-hailing market will keep growing  and both Uber and Lyft will benefit.\nHe draws an analogy to telecoms companies. There is absolutely room for multiple players, like AT&T and MCI, there is not going to be one player in the market.\nThis shift has become even more paramount after Mr Kalanick was ousted earlier this week by a group of investors who want the company to pursue an initial public offering. The new management means we are probably a little bit closer to the big IPO than we were before Travis left, says Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at SharesPost.\nAs Ubers new chief executive grapples with the unusual dynamics of the ride-hailing market, they will also have to make sure Uber lives up to investors expectations. With a valuation of $62.5bn, there is a lot riding on the question of how ride-hailing can make money.\nUber locks horns with homegrown Asian rivals\nAfter an expensive struggle in China that ended in defeat last year to Didi Chuxing, Uber is now embroiled in another costly strategic battle in south-east Asia, write Michael Peel in Bangkok and Jeevan Vasagar in Singapore.\nThe worlds most valuable private technology company is vying with homegrown start-up Grab for dominance of the diverse region of 10 countries, home to more than 600m people and some of the worlds highest economic growth rates.\nThe prize is substantial. A joint study by Google and Temasek last year predicted south-east Asias ride-hailing market will grow from revenues of $2.5bn in 2015 to $13.1bn in 2025.\nExiting China must have been sobering for Uber, says Adrian Lee, research director at Gartner in Singapore. South-east Asia will be critical for Uber to claim true global leadership.\nSingapore-based Grab, founded in 2012, appears to have a solid early-mover advantage. It has expanded aggressively and is present in 55 cities across a region that arcs from Myanmar to the Philippine archipelago. Uber is in 35 cities.\nGrab says it has 2.5m daily rides across south-east Asia, and 70 per cent of the market for private cars and motorbikes  and it claims an even higher share of the market for taxis summoned by app. Uber declines to give equivalent information.\nValued at $3bn after raising $750m in a funding round in September led by Japans SoftBank, Grab has forged partnerships with Chinese giant Didi, Ubers US rival Lyft, and Indias Ola.\nNeither Uber nor Grab has turned a profit. But Uber has a brimming war chest: the American company, valued at $62.5bn, had $7.2bn in cash on hand at the end of the last quarter.\nBoth have had to improvise repeatedly in south-east Asia to navigate obstacles including sometimes-hostile authorities, severe congestion and rapidly expanding and changing cities. They also have to serve differing client bases in a region of vast income variations.\nGrab has pushed into mobile payments as it seeks to bind customers closer. The company aims ultimately to be a dominant force in regional ecommerce for the region, and wants to make more sophisticated use of the large volume of data it is gathering on customers movements and their preferences to offer additional layers of service, according to Anthony Tan, a Grab co-founder.\nDespite Grabs early claims of primacy, all remains to play for in south-east Asia  and much information about the performance of both companies is still unclear. But analysts say Uber may face problems if it has already fallen behind in the race for customers in a market where it is likely to be difficult to change peoples preferences given the similarities of the apps.\nIf Grabs lead is in customer usage, and the lead is a substantial one, it is a real moat, says Ferry Grijpink, a Singapore-based partner at McKinsey, the consultancy.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018. All rights reserved.\nNineteen years ago this month, Zelda Perkins walked out of Miramaxs London offices on Brewer Street in Soho for the last time and went to see a lawyer with a female colleague. They were seeking urgent advice. Ms Perkins, who had worked for Miramax as Harvey Weinsteins assistant, says she has endured several years of sexual harassment by him but had been spurred to quit after the colleague said the film mogul had sexually assaulted her.\nAfter recounting their stories to solicitors at Simons Muirhead & Burton, a London legal firm that specialises in media work, the two women were advised to seek a damages claim from Mr Weinstein. A negotiation began with Allen & Overy, the heavyweight London firm that was acting for the producer of movies such as Pulp Fiction and The English Patient.\nA sum of 250,000 was agreed, to be divided equally between the two women, and a legally binding contract  a non-disclosure agreement  drawn up after several punishing late-night sessions. The women signed it and for almost two decades have not spoken about their experience.\nUntil now. Ms Perkins is breaking the terms of that contract in the Financial Times to talk about her time at Miramax working for Mr Weinstein and the incredibly distressing experience of negotiating her NDA  a process that pitted a young woman against the legal might and power of one of Hollywoods most powerful figures. The recent firing of Mr Weinstein and the emergence of dozens of women who have alleged harassment and assault by him has emboldened her to come forward. In an interview with the FT, she says she wants to shine a light on the workings of a secretive legal process utilised by the rich and powerful to silence victims of sexual harassment.\nI want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement, she says. Unless somebody does this there wont be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under. My entire world fell in because I thought the law was there to protect those who abided by it. I discovered that it had nothing to do with right and wrong and everything to do with money and power.\nMs Perkins, who now works for the theatre production company Robert Fox, is aware that breaking the contract is risky but says she is prepared to take a stand. She does not even have a copy of her NDA  the agreement that was struck in October 1998 prohibited her from having one  although she does have several pages from it outlining Miramaxs obligations to her, and hers to the film company.\nThere are plenty of clauses in it to direct and curtail her future behaviour, including if she were ever asked to provide testimony. One says that if any criminal legal process involving Harvey Weinstein or Miramax requires her to give evidence, she will give 48 hours notice to Mark Mansell, a lawyer at Allen & Overy, before making any disclosure.\nIn the event her evidence is required, you [she] will use all reasonable endeavours to limit the scope of the disclosure as far as possible, the agreement says, adding that she will agree to give reasonable assistance to Miramax if it elects to contest such process.\nMr Mansell and Allen & Overy declined to comment on Ms Perkins agreement, as did her solicitors at Simons Muirhead & Burton.\nAmid the wave of sexual harassment and assault claims in the US, NDAs and the lawyers who help devise them have emerged as a critical element in explaining why so many of those cases remained secret for so long. These accusations have been directed not just at Mr Weinstein in Hollywood, but also Roger Ailes and Bill OReilly, the former chairman and star anchor, respectively, at Fox News.\nWhile Ms Perkins is not the first woman to come forward with claims about harassment from an all-powerful boss, she is one of the first to lift the veil of secrecy to show the invasive process involved in securing such an agreement. Her ordeal included days of gruelling questioning at Allen & Overys London office, capped by a 12-hour session before a phalanx of Mr Weinsteins lawyers that broke at 5am.\nI was made to feel ashamed for disclosing his behaviour and assault, and expected to name those I had spoken to, as if they too were guilty of something, she says.\nMs Perkins never had any ambitions to work in the film industry. In fact, if she had not followed a boyfriend to New York after finishing university in Manchester she may never have crossed paths with Mr Weinstein.\nA television series was being shot on the street where she was staying and a chance meeting led to a job. When it was time for her to return to London a New York colleague introduced her to Donna Gigliotti, a producer who was already working for Miramax  and who would go on to win an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love. That led to a script development job at Miramaxs London office. It was a predominantly female office, she recalls.\nSoon after she had started she was called at home by a senior female colleague. Harvey usually had three assistants working for him in London but one of them had gone Awol. I was asked to step in.\nMr Weinstein would regularly stay at The Savoy on his London trips and his assistants would work with him in his suite. I remember taking a call in the room when another call came through on another phone. He swore at me to pick up the f***ing phone. I said: Im already on the f***ing phone! It sealed my fate as someone who could stand up to him. It wasnt bravery, it was naivety.\nHe had a need to annihilate and humiliate men, she adds. But with women it was all about seduction and submission. Harvey made you feel in an honorary position of trust and influence which he then used as a tool to exert control.\nDespite these misgivings, when asked to become his permanent UK assistant she accepted. At the time Miramax felt like the centre of the universe. She sat in on meetings Mr Weinstein had with stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Gwyneth Paltrow and he asked for her opinion on scripts. He made me feel that he valued my opinion.\nHer first direct experience of sexual harassment by Mr Weinstein was the first time she was alone with him. He went out of the room and came back in his underwear. He asked me if I would give him a massage. Then he asked if he could massage me. She declined.\nShe says he would often walk around the room naked and asked her to be in the room while he had a bath  which tallies with the experience of other women who have come forward. But this was his behaviour on every occasion I was alone with him. I often had to wake him up in the hotel in the mornings and he would try to pull me into bed.\nThe final straw came with the assault on her colleague. They were in Venice for the film festival and were staying at the Excelsior hotel from September 4 to September 7, 1998. She knows the dates are right because she still has her appointments diary from the time.\nLate one day her colleague came to see her in distress. She was white as a sheet and shaking and in a very bad emotional state. She told me something terrible had happened. She was in shock and crying and finding it very hard to talk. I was furious, deeply upset and very shocked. I said: We need to go to the police but she was too distressed. Neither of us knew what to do in a foreign environment.\nMs Perkins immediately confronted Mr Weinstein, who told her nothing had happened. It was very clear looking at the state my colleague was in and then looking at Harvey that I believed her. In a statement Mr Weinsteins spokesperson said: The FT did not provide the identity of any individuals making these assertions. Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\nOn her return to London, Ms Perkins went to see Simons Muirhead & Burton, where she met a solicitor at the firm. I remember telling her about work and conditions with Harvey and she was incredulous. She said it was sexual harassment. I was slightly embarrassed about how naive I had been.\nMiramax was owned by Walt Disney at the time and Ms Perkins was aware that Mr Weinstein had been clashing with Michael Eisner, Disneys then chief executive.\nI wanted to expose him [and] thought that we could go to Disney, she says. But the lawyers were reluctant. They said words to the effect of: they are not going to take your word against his with no evidence.\nShe says the lawyers told her the only option was a damages agreement. I was very upset because the whole point was that we had to stop him by exposing his behaviour. I was warned that he and his lawyers would try to destroy my credibility if I went to court. They told me he would try to destroy me and my family.\nMoney was never a factor, she says: in fact, she vehemently stated to her lawyers that she did not want money to change hands. My driving motivation was to create safeguards to protect future employees. I gave SMB a list of demands aimed at controlling his behaviour, such as a commitment that he receive medical treatment and the creation of a proper human resources complaints procedure at Miramax so that people would be aware of their rights and could complain about harassment if they needed to.\nSMB advised her to seek a years salary, which she says would have been a pittance to Mr Weinstein: she was earning around 20,000 at the time. She sought guidance from a senior female American colleague who knew of Mr Weinsteins behaviour. She told her to negotiate a higher figure because she had more power than I was aware of. After some discussion SMB asked for damages of 250,000. They called Allen & Overy and half an hour later the firm called back to accept.\nThe award, which had been provisionally agreed, initially included a substantial donation to a womens charity  although Ms Perkins says that donation demand was later shelved. But her demands for the creation of a complaints procedure at Miramax and for therapy for Mr Weinstein  which included her being able to meet his therapist  were written into the agreement.\nA letter from her solicitor summarising her obligations states that he would receive therapy for as long as his therapist deems necessary: the company confirmed that it would comply with this clause for three years.\nMiramax said that within six months of its agreement with Ms Perkins the company would appoint three complaint handlers who would investigate future harassment allegations. It also agreed to provide proof of how its staff were told about the new procedures. Crucially, if a complaint against Mr Weinstein occurred within two years of the contract and it resulted in a settlement of either 35,000 or six months salary Miramax agreed to report the matter to Disney  or to dismiss Mr Weinstein.\nAlthough these and other obligations ended up in the contract it is not known whether Miramax fully abided by them.\nThe negotiation with Allen & Overy took a heavy emotional toll, she says. As part of the agreement she had to tell Allen & Overy every individual she had shared her story with so that it could be written into her contract. If I had mentioned any individuals to my legal representatives they couldnt withhold that information. It all had to be disclosed.\nThere were several intense negotiation sessions at Allen & Overys office in London. At 24 years old in a room full of lawyers I felt unsupported by my legal team. Looking back I understand they were following correct practice but at the time I felt totally isolated.\nNineteen years later, memories of that period are still raw. I was pretty broken after the negotiation process. Her goal now is to start a debate about confidential agreements like the one she signed. Im not saying that they shouldnt exist. But they need to be regulated in a fair way. She says she is astonished by a system that prevents her from having a copy of her own agreement.\nI want to call into question the legitimacy of agreements where the inequality of power is so stark and relies on money rather than morality, she says. I want other women who have been sidelined and who arent being allowed to own their own history or their trauma to be able to discuss what they have suffered. I want them to see that the sky wont fall in.\nNDAs: a legal weapon used to silence and intimidate\nCompanies, and individuals, have a range of ways to make sure stories about misconduct do not spread.\nMost financial settlement agreements between accused and accuser include non-disclosure provisions that bar the person receiving the financial settlement from talking about their allegations or even revealing the amount of the settlement, according to lawyers who have represented women in sexual harassment cases. Non-disparagement provisions, which prevent an alleged victim from speaking ill of the person or company they have accused, are also common.\nThe penalties for breaking this silence can be steep. A lot of defendants and the companies they work for are powerful. They can put in draconian liquidated damages provisions in the event there is disclosure, says one lawyer who has worked on such cases.\nFor example, an alleged victim might be forced to pay back not just the full amount of the settlement but also an additional financial penalty and the other partys legal fees. There is a lot of fear hanging over your head, the lawyer says.\nMany of the women who received settlements after accusing Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chief executive and Bill OReilly, one of its key presenters, of sexual harassment do not feel free to speak publicly about their experiences because of NDAs. That includes Gretchen Carlson, who received a $20m settlement in a lawsuit she filed against Ailes in 2016 that set off a cascade of allegations about the cable news networks most powerful figures.\nMs Carlson has become an advocate for prohibiting forced arbitration clauses and their accompanying NDAs. We have chosen as a culture to silence the victims either with settlements where you are gagged from ever saying what happened to you or enforced arbitration, which is a part of employment contracts now, and heres the key  its secret, she told CBS News last week.\nHowever, NDAs cannot lawfully prevent people from reporting claims to law enforcement and government agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the US, or responding to a subpoena.\nAllegations of sexual harassment or misconduct can also be kept quiet by limiting what employees can say about their workplaces. Employment contracts often include NDAs. Many also require that any complaints, including sexual harassment, be resolved in private arbitration rather than a courtroom. Those arbitration-only clauses  which are being challenged in a Supreme Court case  typically limit what a worker can say about the complaint and the ensuing arbitration.\nAll of these operate to silence survivors of sex harassment and sex assault from coming forward and reporting, and they also help shield serial harassers from accountability, says Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality at the US National Womens Law Center. As weve seen in the last few weeks, many survivors feel like Im the only one who this has happened to  so they stay silent. Shannon Bond\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018.

It was expanding rapidly around the world and becoming the most valuable start-up of all time. For software engineers like Ms Fowler, there was exciting work to be done on the app that was changing transportation. Employees at San Franciscos hottest company proudly wore their Uber sweatshirts around town.\nBut two years later, those sweatshirts are no longer visible and Uber is in crisis. Beset by one setback after another, the company has become a symbol of everything that is wrong with the hard-driving tech world. In large part, that shift is due to Ms Fowler.\nIn February she published a blog about her time at Uber that lifted the lid on a company that was out of control. Ms Fowler described the sexual harassment she experienced, including her boss propositioning her for sex on the first day she joined his team. The human resources department turned a blind eye to her complaints, saying he was a high performer. When she wrote about this and other incidents, her post quickly went viral. Ms Fowler had pulled on a thread that would lead to a great unravelling.\nIn the process, the 26-year-old from rural Arizona who had to teach herself at the local library to get into university, found herself at the centre of three of the most important trends of the year. Her description of the reality of working at Uber generated a crisis that has raised questions about the very viability of the company. They also formed an early part of the growing backlash against the power and influence of the Big Tech companies.\nMost of all, her intervention was one of the most important testimonies in what  as the year comes to a close  has become an avalanche of allegations about sexual harassment and assault that have brought down some of the most important men in media, entertainment and business, and which hold the potential to improve the way women are treated at work permanently.\nWomen have been speaking up for many, many years, but were very rarely believed, and there were almost never any real consequences for offenders, Ms Fowler told the Financial Times. This year, that completely changed.\nInside Uber, her story immediately struck a nerve. The account was so damning because it detailed the complicity of Ubers HR department and top executives who protected the harasser. A few days after the post came out, employees wept at the company-wide meeting that was held to discuss it. Ubers board launched several investigations and adopted far-reaching corporate governance reforms. The company set up a hotline for harassment complaints, drawing tips that resulted in more than 20 employees being fired.\nOutside of Uber, the reaction was just as dramatic. Investors started to question whether Travis Kalanick, the controversial chief executive (who used to refer to the company as Boob-er because it helped him meet women) had created a company whose culture had become poisonous. Low morale inside Uber contributed to a series of damaging leaks, including revelations about the mishandling of a rape victims medical records and the existence of Greyball, a technology used to mislead regulators. Mr Kalanick vowed to change, but by June investors demanded that he step down.\nSusan Fowlers letter was the tipping point for us, says one Uber investor, Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at Kapor Capital. We had been trying to get the company to address this behind the scenes. But with Susans blog post, it was  that is enough, it has so crossed the line, it is time for drastic action.\nUber could not have found a more unlikely nemesis than the petite Ms Fowler. She grew up in what she describes as poverty as one of seven children in a small rural Arizona town with just 600 people. Her father was a preacher, prison chaplain and at one stage a high school teacher. Ms Fowler never graduated from high school, instead working as a babysitter and ranch hand, and teaching herself in the local library. Lacking a formal education but determined to go to university, she submitted a list of books she had read as part of her college application.\nAfter winning a place at Arizona State University to study philosophy, she then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, earning a degree in physics. In her final year at Penn, she wrote a blog entitled If Susan can learn physics, so can you, explaining how she caught up despite having no secondary maths education. By the time she reached Uber at age 24, she was a physicist and computer scientist, and wrote her first book about software architecture while working at the company.\nSince leaving Uber last December, Ms Fowler, who now works at the payments start-up Stripe, has kept a low profile. She says she did not imagine the post would have such a big impact. I expected the reaction to die down, but it never did, she says. It became much bigger than me, so much bigger than Uber. Ms Fowler is currently eight months pregnant and on bed rest and, due to health concerns agreed to a written, rather than a face-to face interview, for this article.\nMs Fowler says she felt compelled to blow the whistle because it was the right thing to do. The fact her background is so different from her peers in Silicon Valley may have also played a role, she adds.\nWhen I was younger, I used to think that my unconventional upbringing was a weakness, but over the past few years Ive learnt to see it as one of my greatest strengths, she says. I never had a single thing handed to me, I had to fight for everything I wanted, like my education. When I was harassed and discriminated against, I fought as hard as I could  because I hadnt gone through all of that, I hadnt worked so hard my entire life, just to have someone take it away from me.\nAt the time Ms Fowler published her blog post, the Uber sexual harassment scandal might have seemed like an isolated incident. But the ripples travelled well beyond one company. This year has seen an unprecedented number of women speak publicly about sexual harassment  and unprecedented consequences for their harassers.\nIn Silicon Valley, female entrepreneurs recalled how pitch meetings with potential investors could lead to unwanted groping or propositions. The wave of allegations prompted the firing and resignation of several prominent venture capitalists  including the chief executive of SoFi, the online lender, and Justin Caldbeck, a co-founder of Binary Capital.\nA few months later the tidal wave reached Hollywood. The New York Times and New Yorker revealed in October that Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of sexual harassment and assault that went back decades. Mr Weinstein was fired from his eponymous company and is under investigation by police in at least two countries. Among the dozens of actresses making accusations were Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan.\nMeanwhile the #MeToo campaign swept across social media, as millions of women and some men shared personal stories of sexual harassment, assault and abuse. The movement has only continued to spread. In November, American television stars including Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer were forced to resign due to revelations about harassing colleagues. In politics, Al Franken in the Senate and John Conyers and Trent Frank in the House of Representatives have announced plans to retire after facing harassment allegations. Congress introduced a bill last month that would change the way congressional employees can report harassment.\nThere is a kind of unmasking going on. A lot of these are people who are venerated, people who were taken very seriously, says Robin Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. In the past, a sex scandal might be in the headlines for a few weeks and then disappear. This one seems to really have legs, because new ones keep cropping up, she says.\nThere are many reasons this is happening now but most explanations point, at least in part, to the presence in the White House of President Donald Trump, who was caught on record boasting about sexually assaulting women. In a 2005 recording that was released shortly before last years election, Mr Trump says: When youre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything . . . Grab em by the pussy. You can do anything. Since then, at least 16 women have come forward to accuse Mr Trump of sexual harassment.\nThe fact he was elected to the highest office despite those remarks has fuelled a backlash. The day after his inauguration, millions of women across hundreds of cities took to the streets to demonstrate in the Womens March.\nSocial media has also played a part. Ms Fowler, who is constantly on Twitter, says social media had a very positive role in the movement. It has given a voice to many, like myself, who otherwise wouldnt have had a platform, she says. #MeToo is a perfect example of this . . . It made the rest of the world finally understand the true extent of inappropriate behaviour against women, and the damage it causes.\nAnother reason why 2017 has been a turning point is simply that there is strength in numbers: women have been inspired by others who spoke out.\nDefinitely she was a role model for me, says Cheryl Yeoh, an entrepreneur who published her own account of assault in July. Like Ms Fowler, Ms Yeoh decided to write her story herself and publish it online, rather than approach a journalist or try to go through a lawyer. She says that watching the impact Ms Fowler had on Uber was very encouraging. If I hadnt seen what had happened to Uber after her post, I wouldnt have dared to write my account, she says.\nThe cultural shift that has come about this year is also the result of decades of work by activists and leaders fighting for equal rights. Ms Klein links the wave of allegations back to events like the 1991 testimony of Anita Hill, whose televised account of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas riveted the country during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court, and to the founding of the Me Too movement a decade ago by activist Tarana Burke.\nWhat Susan Fowler and the #MeToo movement have in common is they both stand on the shoulders of giants, says Ms Klein.\nEarlier generations of female leaders often found sexual harassment a complex issue to raise, and instead focused on areas like equal pay or reproductive rights. Women who spoke out about harassment often found themselves blamed, and their careers derailed.\nLilly Ledbetter, the equal pay advocate whose court case on wage discrimination made it to the Supreme Court and resulted in the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, welcomes the #MeToo movement. I wish this had happened earlier, she says. Ive been so glad that this is all coming to the forefront now.\"\nShe recalls her own experience of harassment in the early 1980s  when a manager asked that she have sex with him in order to get a high performance review. She never reported it at that time. I let that one slide, she says.\nThings have gotten more open and people have a tendency to support each other better today, she says. I think women in the beginning didnt trust each other and didnt support each other, and now they are better at that. There are companies that are looking at their policies and changing, and being a lot more supportive, she says. One policy change that would make a difference is ending the widespread practice of making employees seek arbitration for harassment claims, and Congress is currently considering a bill that would end that practice.\nAt the same time, some are concerned the movement could end up backfiring in subtle ways, or result in discrimination against women in the workplace.\nThe percentage of men who will be afraid to be alone with a female colleague has to be sky high right now, wrote Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook, in a recent post. I have already heard the rumblings of a backlash: This is why you shouldnt hire women. Actually, this is why you should, she wrote.\nMs Fowler is expected to give birth to a little girl. At Stripe, she is the editor-in-chief of a quarterly magazine called Increment, which is geared towards software engineers. She is also working on a book and a movie about her experiences.\nThe fortunes of Uber, on the other hand, have changed more drastically than anyone could have imagined. The company that once looked invincible has seen its valuation fall from $71bn to $54bn and it has lost market share in the US. Would Uber have changed if it werent for Susans blog post? I dont know, one senior executive admits privately. Certainly her post gave us the resolve that we needed to change.\nThe contrast between the plaudits for Ms Fowler and the crisis at Uber is perhaps the clearest sign of how much things have changed for women who speak up about harassment.\nYet it still comes at a cost. The most difficult [thing] has been that being a whistleblower displaces and dwarfs all of your other career aspirations, all your accomplishments. Youre no longer the engineer, or the physicist, or the writer  youre the whistleblower, says Ms Fowler. Nevertheless, she says, it is a badge of honour.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018.

Each pays homage to past office-holders: Roy Jenkins, Labour party reformer and grand gourmand; Gaston Thorn, plucky Luxembourger; and Jacques Delors, the French philosopher king who helped to build the single market and the euro.\nThe fourth picture catches the eye. The year is 1966. Walter Hallstein, German law professor, diplomat and first Commission president, is entertaining President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia. Here is a snapshot of the original, intimate club of Six in the European Economic Community. Todays sprawling, squabbling European Union of 28 members, soon to be 27 with the departure of the British, seems a world apart.\nThis week marks the 60th anniversary of the founding Treaty of Rome. The clinking of champagne glasses will be muted. Europe remains battered by low growth and high unemployment, a migration wave from the Middle East and north Africa, not to mention Brexit and Donald Trump. If Jean-Claude Juncker is feeling depressed, he masks it well. The current president of the European Commission, another Luxembourger in the top job, has agreed to have lunch to mark the Rome anniversary. He arrives on time at 12.30pm, all smiles behind a sober dark suit, white shirt and dashing pink tie.\nHow come it has been so long? he says in French, embracing me warmly. Its been 15 years since we last met. Back in the 1990s, when I was the FTs bureau chief in Brussels. Juncker was his countrys prime minister, a mini-power-broker between France and Germany and a trusted source.\nAt 62, he has been near the centre of power for more than three decades, present at the creation of the modern EU. Today, he is the last man standing.\nIve been elected 14 times in my life, nine times to the Luxembourg parliament, four times to the European Parliament, he says, omitting the last controversial vote when Buggins turn dictated he was the centre-rights candidate for the Commission job. Being described as a stupid bureaucrat with no link to representative democracy is difficult to take. We are not in an iron tower.\n***\nAs we take our place at a pristine dining table set for two, I begin with a few short sharp questions: what went wrong with Europe? Was enlargement a mistake? What about the original mission, to exorcise the demons of nationalism and war?\nJuncker says enlargement was an inevitable consequence of the end of the cold war. More than 20 new countries took their place on the European map. Border conflicts posed a huge risk. Yet he admits the message of war and peace no longer resonates with the younger generation.\nI [also] explain Europe with a future perspective . . . we are losing weight economically and demographically even if we think we are still masters of the world. By the end of this century, we will be 4 per cent of Europeans out of 10 billion people. This is not the time for new divisions. We have to stick together.\nThe president sips from a glass of wine, a crispy white from Languedoc. My father was a steelworker and he told me about a new beginning in Europe [in the 1950s]. He had been forced to join the German army, along with three of his brothers. That was a terrible period in the lives of my father and uncles, which impressed me for the rest of my life.\nHis father was wounded in Odessa on the eastern front and taken prisoner by the Russians. During the Brexit referendum campaign, British tabloids reported that his father was a Nazi, a slur that deeply upset the president and his father, who passed away shortly afterwards. It was unjust and disgusting, says Juncker, even [Nigel] Farage [leader of Ukip] apologised.\nNow in the twilight of his career, Juncker has been criticised as low-energy, a relic of a bygone era who delegates too much to Martin Selmayr, his Machiavellian chief of staff, and who spends too little time in the newcomer member states in central and eastern Europe. (I accept this, he says of the last point.)\nOver a two-hour conversation, he is determined to show he is on top of his brief, rattling off statistics ranging from the minimum wage in Bulgaria to the declining number of telephone kiosks in Germany, all delivered effortlessly in English, French and occasionally German. Food is a tiresome distraction. The president barely touches his starter, a tasty if stringy Carpaccio de Saint-Jacques in sesame and soya oil.\n***\nA waitress arrives with a bottle of red wine, a 2005 Pomerol. No, no, says the president, waving away the claret. I cannot mix white and red. We will have major events.\nThe presidents weakness for alcohol is well-known. Today, he is on best behaviour. I ask him how he survived all those late-night councils. By his account, the worst was a budget meeting in Brussels in late 1985 ahead of Spain and Portugal joining the EU.\nI was chairing the meeting. It started on Monday morning at 11am and finished on Thursday 11pm, without going to the hotel, without having a shower. They [still] sent me the bill.\nSo whats the secret of getting through the all-night sittings? I ask.\nCoffee and water.\nYou cant be serious.\nNo whisky, nothing of that kind.\nNo brandy?\"\nNo, no, no.\nWith one eye on Brexit, I ask the president to name the most brutal negotiations he was involved in.\nGreece continuing to be a member of the euro, he shoots back.\nBetween 2004 and 2013, Juncker was on another Brussels jobs merry-go-round, chairing the eurogroup, which by 2011 comprised 17 members. I had to be supportive of Greece because no one else was. I had to take in my compromise . . . and I had to tell the third group [the Slovaks and Slovenes]: I will no longer listen to you because you are not in the right mood. Those were really difficult moments.\nIn 2015, the same drama played out, this time with the new Greek government led by Alexis Tsipras, the radical left-winger. By now Juncker was Commission president and keen to cut a deal on Greek debt restructuring. It took a moment to convince him I was partly on his side. All this was very difficult because the Commission was not really in charge; it was the eurogroup. We were taking all the initiatives. And the Germans and others were saying: What are you doing there? This is not your job. \nJuncker has irked member states by insisting he is running a political Commission not a bureaucracy. They fear a power-grab but the president has a point: the Brussels-based executive has the right of legislative initiative, it enforces the rules, it keeps the show on the road.\nI first witnessed Juncker in action in Dublin Castle in 1996 when he helped to broker a deal over the German-inspired Stability Pact to enforce budgetary discipline in the future eurozone.\nChirac started the meeting by saying the pact was an invention of German bureaucrats, pointing very directly at Theo Waigel, then finance minister, who refused to speak to Chirac. It was the very first time I played a role at head of state level. And when I could say to myself: without me, it would have been a collapse.\nHelmut Kohl was even more influential. Juncker describes the German chancellor as a modest giant, a little saint in a great church who understood the secret psychology of making the smaller countries feel he was listening. When everything went wrong, he would say: Listen, friends, I am going to be strongly attacked in Germany. But it does not matter; I am doing this for European reasons. I am not playing the national card; I am playing now the European card. Please do the same. Today and next time. That happened three or four times. And the others were in fact ashamed.\nThe waitress brings more Pomerol to wash down the veal fillet that is tender, if a little overcooked. By now, Juncker is dropping his diplomatic mask. Frances inability to stick to budget discipline was a big problem and it still is. Those who believe the Dutch elections show populism has peaked are wrong. Fruchtbar ist der Schoss (the womb is still fertile), he says, citing Brechts warning about fascism returning to Europe in the 1950s.\nCan Marine Le Pen win the French presidential election?\nI dont think so . . . I cannot imagine the whole of France shifting to the extreme right. But they have a solid Sockel (pillar) of support.\nI suggest the danger lies in the collapse of the traditional centre-left and centre-right parties. Juncker agrees: That is the problem of France . . . the French are not used to coalitions. They hate each other.\nBy contrast, postwar Germany has a different political tradition. The German system was never driven by extremists, whereas the French system was driven by communist extremists and now by the extreme right . . . the best thing to happen in France would be bridging these abnormally huge differences. Will it happen? I dont know.\nThis hints at a preference for Emmanuel Macron, the centrist newcomer with no party, but Juncker says he has no intention of meddling.\nThe coffee and chocolates arrive. It is time to tackle Brexit, which he describes as a tragedy, and people do not know that this tragedy will lead to conclusions.\nBefore last years referendum the then UK prime minister David Cameron and his close ally and the then chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, were desperate to appease Tory hardliners. Cameron always said: I have one major problem. If Theresa May [the then home secretary who succeeded him as prime minister after Britain voted last June to leave the EU] publicly says that she is for Brexit, then we are lost. \nJuncker describes May as a Brexiter and predicts Cameron will not be judged kindly by history. I have met in my life two big destroyers: Gorbachev, who destroyed the Soviet Union, and Cameron, who destroyed the United Kingdom to some extent, even if there is no wave of Scotland to become independent.\nThe exit bill for the UK will be at least 60bn and Britains departure will also change the balance of power in Europe, says Juncker. The UK always defended new members from central and eastern Europe. Germany cannot replace the British nor can it supplant Britains role in the transatlantic relationship.\nJuncker is visibly agitated about President Donald Trumps delight in Brexit.

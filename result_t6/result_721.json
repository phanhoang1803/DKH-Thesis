        "content": "The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring ejaculation is murder and they want strict laws against the practice.\nLife begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control, said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. God made mens semen for a purpose, and you can just waste that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!\nStratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick p*rnos on P*rnHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!",

    "explanation": "The original news caption states that anti-abortion groups claim every sperm cell is \"a life.\"  Both the internal and external validation checks support this claim, although with some nuances. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check analyzes the image directly. The image shows protestors holding signs with anti-abortion messages. The most striking sign reads, \"Ejaculation is Murder.\"  This strongly suggests an ideology where the act of ejaculation is considered the taking of a life, implying a belief that each sperm cell represents a life. The confidence score of 10 reflects this strong visual connection to the caption's claim.  The internal check correctly identifies that this is an extreme viewpoint within the anti-abortion movement, not necessarily representative of all groups.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check provides supporting evidence from a source that quotes a pro-life activist explicitly stating, “Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!” This directly confirms the caption's assertion. However, the external check also notes that this is the statement of one activist, not necessarily the position of all anti-abortion groups. The lower confidence score of 8 reflects this limitation, acknowledging that the statement supports the caption's claim but doesn't necessarily encompass the entirety of anti-abortion beliefs. The fact that Snopes is fact-checking this specific claim highlights its unusual and controversial nature.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nThe main discrepancy is the difference in confidence scores between the internal (10) and external (8) checks. This stems from the internal check focusing solely on the visual evidence in the image, while the external check acknowledges the broader context of diverse viewpoints within the anti-abortion movement.  There's no disagreement on the core claim; both checks agree that at least some anti-abortion groups promote the idea that each sperm cell represents a life.  The external check provides the necessary context by showing that this is an extreme position, not necessarily universally held.\n\nVisual Evidence:\nThe visual evidence is unambiguous. The signs held by protestors clearly express an extreme anti-abortion stance, associating the act of ejaculation with murder.  This visual aligns perfectly with the claim in the caption. There's no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nConsidering both internal and external validation, the claim in the caption is not out of context.  While the external source shows that this view is not universally held within all anti-abortion groups (as indicated by the lower confidence score from the external check),  the existence of such beliefs within a segment of the movement is undeniable. The visual evidence strongly supports the existence of this belief, and the external source gives a specific example. The final confidence score of 9 is a balanced assessment reflecting the strong visual support coupled with the external source's qualification that this view isn't universally adopted by all anti-abortion groups.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation support the caption's claim that some anti-abortion groups consider every sperm cell a life. The external check provides a specific example, while also noting that this is not a universally held view within all such groups.  Visual evidence strongly supports the claim."

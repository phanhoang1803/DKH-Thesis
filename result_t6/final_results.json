It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

        "explanation": "The internal validation gives a high confidence score (10) because the image seems consistent with the caption's description of a metro train on a whale art installation in Spijkenisse, Netherlands.  However, the external validation expresses significant doubt (confidence score of 4), citing the improbability of such a specific event and the lack of corroborating news reports.  This discrepancy necessitates a thorough analysis.\n\nVisual Evidence:\nThe image undeniably shows a damaged metro train resting atop a whale-shaped sculpture.  The setting appears to be outdoors, and the background suggests a possibly urban environment. While the image itself is visually compelling, it does not provide evidence of the train's trajectory or the nature of the barrier it supposedly crashed through. There's no clear evidence of a crash site beyond the damage to the train itself.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check focuses on the consistency of the caption with the image.  The elements – metro train, Spijkenisse, Netherlands, whale art installation – are all individually verifiable.  The internal check concludes that the caption appears to describe the visual content accurately, but it relies heavily on the assumption that the image depicts an actual event rather than a staged artwork or manipulated image.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check raises critical concerns about the plausibility of the event described. The core issue is the extreme improbability of a train crashing through a barrier and landing precisely on a whale sculpture.  Such a specific outcome is statistically highly improbable. The lack of verifiable external sources further reinforces this skepticism.  The absence of news reports, considering the supposed scale of the event (a train crash), significantly weakens the claim.\n\nDiscrepancy Resolution:\nThe core disagreement lies in the assessment of the event's likelihood. The internal check focuses on the direct image-caption alignment, while the external check critically assesses the probability of the described event.  The lack of supporting evidence from news sources or other reliable reporting heavily undermines the credibility of the caption. Even if the image is authentic, the caption's implication that this was an accident lacks significant supporting evidence.\n\nVisual Tampering/Miscontextualization:\nWhile the image itself seems genuine, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility of image manipulation or misrepresentation. The lack of context surrounding the image (e.g., news source, date) leaves open the possibility that it could be a staged scene, a piece of conceptual art, or a digitally altered photograph.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the significant discrepancy between the high internal confidence and the low external confidence, and the lack of corroborating evidence, we must conclude that the caption is likely out of context. The improbability of the described event and the absence of supporting evidence in news reports or other credible sources outweigh the apparent visual consistency.  The confidence score is lowered to reflect this uncertainty and the reliance on a single image as evidence. The event might not be completely fictional, but the provided caption is out of context with regards to the event description.",
        "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds the caption consistent with the image, but external validation casts strong doubt due to the implausibility of the event and the absence of corroborating evidence.  This leads to a conclusion of out-of-context with low confidence."

Popular memes have claimed (for humorous effect) that the picture was taken in Massachusetts, or (less homorously) in Canada:\nThe image actually captures a stretch of road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture.\nThe photograph was taken by Mihai Apostu and posted to his blog, \"A Romanian in Japan,\" in April 2007:\nBefore heading down town we decided to take a walk up to Towada. On the way to Towada starting from April thh Gold Line Route is opened. This year's amount of snow was smaller than last year but the Hakkoda Walls are still big. Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall.

The external validation provides strong evidence supporting the core description of the image—high snow walls along a highway—but corrects the location to Japan.  The discrepancy lies solely in the location. The image itself clearly shows a highway with significant snow accumulation forming high walls on either side. This visual evidence aligns with both the internal and external checks' core description.  The internal check's low confidence reflects the location error, while the external check's higher confidence stems from corroborating information and the widespread circulation of the image, thus suggesting that the location information is an error. Given that the core description of the image ('high walls of snow lining the edges of a highway') is accurate, and the location is a supplementary detail, the primary focus should be on the correct visual representation. The internal check’s 100% confidence in a false location negates its value for assessing the accuracy of the caption's core description. The external check's 80% confidence stems from multiple sources corroborating the image's widespread circulation, thus indicating that the image's description is widely confirmed even with location discrepancy. Therefore, the final assessment concludes the caption is out-of-context primarily because of the incorrect location. The confidence score reflects the external validation’s high confidence in the core image description, despite the location error. There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization.",

The external check uses an unspecified source (Source 1) stating that the image depicts high snow walls lining a highway, thus confirming the image content.

Therefore, the caption is partially accurate in describing the image's content but inaccurate in specifying the location.

Considering both aspects, we arrive at a conservative assessment: the caption is out of context because the location is incorrect, even though the description of the image itself is accurate. A high confidence score is assigned due to the clear and directly supported internal contradiction (location mismatch) and the explicit external confirmation of the image description.

The photograph seen here shows debris resulting from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake (and resulting tsunami) that struck northern Japan in 2011:\nAn aerial view of damage to Wakuya, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area in northern Japan. Ships and aircraft from the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group are conducting search and rescue operations and re-supply missions as directed in support of Operation Tomodachi throughout northern Japan.\nFurthermore, National Geographic reported that while the name \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" may conjure up an image of a floating island of debris, the actual garbage patch itself was actually difficult to see:\nFor many people, the idea of a garbage patch conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics cant always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesnt show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes. The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nThe claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers \"8.1 percent of the Pacific Ocean\" is also a matter of debate. The number appeared to come from a 2008 quote from Marcus Eriksen, the research director at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation:\n\"Charles Moore, an American oceanographer who discovered the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" or \"trash vortex\", believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region. Marcus Eriksen, a research director of the US-based Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which Mr Moore founded, said: \"The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on. It is not quite like that. It is almost like a plastic soup. It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States.\"\nA 2011 study from Oregon State University, however, asserted that the real size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was hundreds of times smaller than commonly claimed:\nThere is a lot of plastic trash floating in the Pacific Ocean, but claims that the \"Great Garbage Patch\" between California and Japan is twice the size of Texas are grossly exaggerated, according to an analysis by an Oregon State University scientist.\nFurther claims that the oceans are filled with more plastic than plankton, and that the patch has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950s are equally misleading, pointed out Angelicque \"Angel\" White, an assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State.\n\"There is no doubt that the amount of plastic in the world's oceans is troubling, but this kind of exaggeration undermines the credibility of scientists,\" White said. \"We have data that allow us to make reasonable estimates; we dont need the hyperbole. Given the observed concentration of plastic in the North Pacific, it is simply inaccurate to state that plastic outweighs plankton, or that we have observed an exponential increase in plastic.\"\nThe studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically \"cohesive\" plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.\n\"The amount of plastic out there isn't trivial,\" White said. \"But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.\"\nBut a study published in 2018 stated the opposite of many of these assertions -- that the Pacific Ocean trash pile was much larger than previously reported and rapidly growing, that most of its bulk was larger objects rather than microplastics, and that about one-fifth of its volume came from the 2011 Japan earthquake referenced above:\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n\"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\nWhy the discrepancy? A variety of factors made it difficult to posit an accurate estimate of the debris field's true scope in earlier surveys:\nNo one knows for how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortexs area nearly impossible to measure.",

        "explanation": "The original news caption claims that a massive garbage patch covers 8.1% of the Pacific Ocean.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly suggest this caption is inaccurate and out of context.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal validation check reveals a significant discrepancy between the image and the caption. The image depicts a relatively small area of marine debris, clearly not representative of 8.1% of the Pacific Ocean's surface. This internal inconsistency alone casts serious doubt on the caption's accuracy. The confidence score of 3 reflects the clear mismatch between the visual evidence and the quantitative claim in the caption.\n\nExternal Validation:\nExternal validation further reinforces the conclusion that the caption is misleading.  The external check highlights conflicting reports regarding the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. While some sources have made claims about it covering a significant percentage of the ocean, other studies have presented much lower estimates. The lack of consensus among credible sources, coupled with the mention of older, now-contradicted data (an 8.1% figure from 2008), significantly weakens the claim's credibility. A confidence score of 4 demonstrates the uncertainty and conflicting information from external sources.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nThe primary discrepancy lies between the visual evidence (a small patch of debris) and the quantitative claim (8.1% of the Pacific Ocean).  The external validation reveals uncertainty regarding the actual size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, highlighting the inherent difficulty in accurately assessing such a large and dispersed area of pollution.  This lack of precision in measuring the patch's size underscores the problems with the caption's specific claim.\n\nConclusion:\nConsidering both the internal and external validation results, the caption is definitively out of context. The visual evidence fails to support the claim's scale, and external sources confirm the wide variability and uncertainty in estimations of the garbage patch's size. The substantial disagreement and the lack of corroboration from reliable sources make the claim highly implausible. The high confidence score (9) is assigned due to the strong, consistent findings from both internal and external checks.  The caption significantly misrepresents the scale and extent of the marine debris problem. The small area depicted in the image is a localized example of pollution, not a visual representation of the globally disputed claim.\n",

The visual content is consistent with a formal state event, but it lacks the necessary details (e.g., banners, speeches, specific political figures) to definitively confirm its relation to the specified inauguration.  Therefore, given the low confidence score in the internal validation and the complete lack of external supporting evidence, the caption is considered out of context. The final verdict relies heavily on the absence of corroborative evidence, making a strong case for the caption being unrelated to the inauguration described.  In the absence of any reliable external source to confirm the event depicted, the visual elements alone do not offer enough evidence to confirm the caption's assertion.

The internal validation check notes the alignment of location entities with the visual content but points out the \"Valentine's Day\" mention in the caption as unverifiable from the image alone.

The external validation check supports the plausibility of rose sales in anticipation of Valentine's Day in Abidjan but acknowledges the uncertainty of the claim about a specific Friday without further evidence. Both checks give high confidence scores (8 out of 10).  There's no significant disagreement between the internal and external checks.  The image itself does not explicitly state that the day is Valentine's Day, but the scene is consistent with Valentine's Day preparations; rose sales in urban markets are common before Valentine's Day. Therefore, considering that the image does not explicitly disprove the caption and that the context fits plausibly, the caption is considered not out of context but with a slightly reduced confidence score reflecting the missing temporal evidence (the day being explicitly confirmed as Friday before Valentine's Day). Visual inspection confirms the presence of various rose colors, as noted in the caption and both validation checks. There is no evidence of image tampering or miscontextualization. The high confidence scores from both checks support the plausibility of the caption's assertion that vendors sell roses in Abidjan before Valentine's Day.  The absence of direct verification of the \"Friday before Valentine's Day\" detail necessitates the slight reduction in confidence.  In summary, the caption aligns well with the image's contents, but the lack of explicit evidence of the specific date slightly lowers the confidence.",

But sales, not security, are on people's minds here.\nThe cows must be sold before the holiday if their owners are to turn a profit. But there just aren't a lot of people buying this year.\n\"It's in God's hands,\" says Jen Agha, a livestock salesman. Like his colleagues, he wavers between hope for a last-minute customer rush and fear that he will lose his investment.\nA nationwide drought and skyrocketing food prices have made this year's buildup to Afghanistan's favorite holiday a bittersweet one. Just about all of the cows here had to be imported from Pakistan, and vendors say that adds about $100 over last year's price.\nThe increase alone is more than a month's salary for most Afghan families, but vendors say they'll drop their prices if sales stay low.\nMy bureau manager, Rahmatullah, and I are among the few people looking to buy an animal.\nRahmatullah tells a salesman we are looking for a calf, one old enough to meet Islamic guidelines for the sacrifice. Teeth factor into that decision  the two big teeth have to be in, but not the little teeth.\nSalesman Tanadar presents us with a calf that's nearly as tall as I am.\nIt's a really big one. It's black and white  it looks like a milk cow with horns. The cow we settle on is two years old and weighs 200 kilograms. Rahmatullah says that's enough to feed the staff, as well as neighbors and the poor.\nI ask Rahmatullah who is going to slaughter the cow, and he says I should do it. Laughing, I say I'm not doing it and suggest he hire a butcher to slice the neck, drain the blood and say the prayers required for the ceremony in our courtyard Monday.\nThen we'll divide the meat among my staff members. They, in turn, will give two-thirds of their share to neighbors who aren't sacrificing an animal, as well as to the poor.\nFinally, we haggle over price. We settle on $530  that's better than last year. And for $10 more, we hire a pickup to carry our calf to town.",

The image clearly depicts Serhiy Kivalov at what appears to be the Liberty Ball during Trump's inauguration. All elements mentioned in the caption—Kivalov, the Liberty Ball, and Trump's inauguration—are visually present. While the caption mentions Facebook as the source, this is not visually verifiable, but it does not contradict the image's content. The lack of visual evidence of the Facebook post does not significantly impact the assessment.\n\nThe external validation offers support but acknowledges limitations. While the existence of Serhiy Kivalov as a Ukrainian lawmaker, Trump's inauguration date, and the occurrence of the Liberty Ball are confirmed, independently verifying Kivalov's presence at the specific event through external sources presents a challenge. This is not uncommon when assessing historical photos, especially those from less widely reported events or without explicit verifiable media coverage from reputed sources. The uncertainty arises from the absence of readily available corroborative evidence from reputable news articles or other confirmed sources, not necessarily from any contradictions.\n\nThe difference in confidence scores (8 for internal, 8 for external) reflects the difference in the types of evidence used. Internal validation uses direct visual evidence from the image itself. External validation relies on broader contextual evidence, which in this case is circumstantial though plausible.  Although the lack of readily accessible external verification slightly reduces the overall confidence score, the strong visual evidence internally supports the claim.  The plausible external context supports this assessment further, despite the absence of definitive corroboration.  Therefore, the conclusion is that the caption accurately reflects the content of the image.",

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, which resulted in the death of a police officer and four other individuals, some of Trump's backers floated the evidence-free claim that this attempted insurrection was actually the work of antifa. While the claim that antifa was responsible for the attack has been dismissed by the FBI, this rumor continued to circulate on social media.\nOn Jan. 15, 2021, a slight wrinkle was added to this rumor: Not only was antifa responsible for the attack, but so was CNN. A viral video supposedly showing \"CNN's Own\" Jade Sacker quickly racked up more than 2 million views as it circulated on Twitter. Other postings of this video labeled Sacker as \"CNN photojournalist\" or \"CNN reporter.\"\nHere's a screenshot of one such posting.\nWhile this video was widely shared as if it showed a woman named Jade Sacker, we have not been able to independently verify this. If this video truly does show Sacker, however, it's important to note Sacker is not an employee of CNN. Describing her as \"CNN's own\" or \"CNN reporter Jade Sacker\" is inaccurate.\nSacker is a freelance photojournalist who documented the pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. She is not, nor has she ever been, employed by CNN.\nMatt Dornic, the head of strategic communications for CNN Worldwide, wrote on Twitter that \"no one named Jade Sacker works for CNN.\"\nSo, where does this rumor come from?\nOn the evening of Jan. 6, Sacker appeared on \"Anderson Cooper 360\" alongside a man named John Sullivan to talk about what they saw during the Capitol riot. Specially, these two appeared on the network to discuss a piece of footage captured by Sullivan that showed the shooting death of a woman inside the Capitol. Here's a screenshot from that interview:\nSacker appeared on CNN because she was a witness to the Capitol riot, not because she was employed by CNN, or because she was hired by the network to report from the event.\nIt should be noted that Sullivan was arrested by the FBI for his alleged involvement in the riot a few days after this interview. While Sullivan claims that he was at the Capitol to document the event as a journalist, the FBI affidavit notes that Sullivan can be heard on video yelling things like \"we about to burn this shit down\" and \"we accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history.\"",

The external check, however, found strong evidence supporting the existence of a video showing Jade Sacker filming such an event. While this external evidence corroborates part of the caption (the existence of a video showing someone filming the pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol), it also reveals crucial information missing from the caption: that Jade Sacker is not a CNN reporter, contradicting the original caption's claim.\n\nThe discrepancy arises because the internal check relies solely on the provided image, which lacks sufficient information to confirm the identities of individuals or the exact context of the filming. The external check, on the other hand, relies on information from another source describing the video's content, and while that source verifies the existence of a video consistent with the core of the caption's description, it corrects the inaccurate claim about Ms. Sacker's employment status. This implies that while a video exists that broadly aligns with the caption's description of a person filming a pro-Trump mob at the Capitol, the detail specifying Jade Sacker as a CNN reporter is inaccurate, rendering the caption misleading.\n\nThe high confidence score from the external check is due to the corroboration of the event depicted in the video. However, the low confidence score of the internal check and the factual inaccuracy regarding Ms. Sacker's profession lead to a final conclusion that the caption is out of context. The caption is partially true (a video exists showing someone filming a pro-Trump mob at the Capitol), but it is misleading because it incorrectly identifies the person filming and their employment.",

While the image supports parts of the caption (Joker makeup, American flag, South Beach location), crucial elements like \"climbing on a car\" and \"making it rain,\" and the precise phrase \"Fucking COVID is over baby!\" lack external verification.  The external check highlights the inherent difficulty in verifying such specific behavioral details without additional evidence beyond a single image.  The claim that this individual \"made it rain\" is particularly problematic. This typically refers to showering others with money.  There is nothing in the image to support this action.  While the general context of attention-seeking behavior in South Beach is plausible, the exact details described in the caption remain unverified. The discrepancy between the high internal confidence score (10) and the low external confidence score (4) stems from this critical difference in the scope of what can be verified.  The image provides strong visual confirmation for some parts of the caption, but the more specific and action-oriented claims are uncorroborated. Considering the significant uncertainty regarding the events described beyond what is visually apparent and the lack of external evidence for the unconfirmed actions, we must conclude that the caption is likely out of context, although the core visual aspects are accurately portrayed. The confidence score reflects this uncertainty, leaning towards a conservative assessment due to the lack of external verification for the key aspects of the caption. The image is not visually tampered with, and all visible details are consistent with the visual elements described in the caption, but the caption makes claims that far exceed what the image can support.",

            "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a naked child using bedsheets to escape from an upper story of Buckingham Palace.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nContext\nThe video was released on YouTube as a \"stealth promotion\" for the E! comedy series \"The Royals.\" It did not depict an actual event, nor was the naked male seen in the video a child.\nOrigin\nA video posted to the \"Covert Geopolitics\" YouTube channel in November 2019 purported to capture a \"fully naked 'Filipino looking child' escaping from a window of the Buckingham Palace in the middle of the day.\" The clip was accompanied by a voice-over narration that consisted of a long diatribe about \"pedophiles\" and \"Satanists.\" Our partial transcript below gives a general idea of what the narrator tried to convey (minus the profanity):\nThis is how disturbing your world really is. I've been holding on to this footage for way too long. Every time I decide to post it, they take it down.\n[...]\nWhat's up? I mean, the top floor [of] Buckingham Palace ... just a naked-looking Filipino kid, you know, tied a whole bunch of sheets together just ... just for the heck of it. Yeah, that's it. Just for the heck of it. He's willing to try to escape naked, leap out of that floor, while a parade is going by. What has happened to that kid that he's willing to do that? Imagine that.\nThis kid looks like he falls to death here in about 10 seconds. This is what you are deciding to not listen to and not understand, on everything that I've been trying to tell you what's going on in the world. Your world is run by Satanists, and these are their victims, and we seem to think that it's just funny and okay. That's [expletive] sad. The world you live in people, controlled by pedophiles.\n[...]\nHowever, neither the video clip nor the description of it offered by \"Covert Geopolitics\" was real. The \"Covert Geopolitics\" version of the clip was actually a slowed-down, looped, lower-resolution version of a video  purportedly captured by a tourist in London  that prompted a good deal of consternation and speculation when it mysteriously appeared online in February 2015. The Mirror wrote:\nThis extraordinary video clip appears to show a man scaling Buckingham Palace  completely nude.\nThe shocking clip was posted on YouTube earlier today and has so far been watched by more than 500 people.\nIt appears to show a man climbing down from a window before falling spectacularly.\nThe incident was captured by bystanders standing over the road from the royal residence.\nIt is not known whether the man was injured in the apparent fall.\nIt's also not clear whether the clip is a hoax, but we will bring you more details as we get them.\nA spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the video.\nThat clip, in turn, was a stealth promotion created for the upcoming premiere of the E! Entertainment television series \"The Royals,\" a \"drama about a fictional British Royal family who inhabit a world of luxury and regal tradition that also involves intrigue and unexpected twists, revealing the complexities faced by royals trying to maintain high-profile relationships under scrutiny.\" From the E! Online website:\nThe [naked guy] video made headlines when it was uploaded from what seemed to be a tourist's YouTube channel while visiting Buckingham Palace during the changing of the guard.\nIn the video, an almost completely naked man (minus a sock) was seen climbing down a bed sheet, on the side of the palace from a window. Blogs and news agencies from Daily Mail to Cosmopolitan covered the video not knowing whether it was real or fake while users took to the comments to share their opinions.\nBut now, we have answers. With the \"exclusive, never-before-seen extended footage of the scandal\" from D-Throned, an online tabloid covering E!'s fictional modern day royal family from \"The Royals,\" it's clear that this was a clever way for E! to give viewers a glimpse of the drama that will go down on the upcoming premiere season of the new show.\nIn the full tabloid video, viewers see that the naked man was actually escaping from Princess Eleanor's (Alexandra Park) chambers, once again putting her back into the spotlight. \"The renegade royal has been spotted dancing wildly at a late night club and snogging at least one member of the cabinet,\" the narrator explains.\nThe full video can be viewed on Vimeo.\nThe promotional strategy was conceived by the advertising company Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), which also created a short video asserting bragging rights over its worldwide success. Producer SF Hartley did the same.\nWhatever activities the satanists of the world might be up to, producing viral commercials for cable television dramas is probably not among them.\nSources:\ndthronednews.

It surfaced again this week on Facebook and Twitter.\nThe original photo was taken by Judie Burstein in 1992, according to Globe Photos, a celebrity and entertainment photo company that archived the image in March 2004.\nThe image shows Trump in a red tie and a black suit standing with his arms wrapped around his mother and father. Mary Trump is wearing a pink and black floral suit, with pearls draped around her neck. Fred Trump is wearing a navy suit, red pocket square and polka dot tie. The three Trumps posed for the photo against a marble wall backdrop and a sign that reads theater tickets.\nTrump followed his father into the real estate business. Fred Trump, who made a fortune in real estate, died in 1999 at the age of 93. Mary Trump died in 2000, at the age of 88.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

While the image shows Trump with his mother and another man in robes, the robes' affiliation with the KKK remains unconfirmed.  The internal check acknowledges the need for further information to verify the claim, assigning a low confidence score of 4. This uncertainty highlights the limitations of relying solely on visual inspection for such sensitive claims.\n\nHowever, external validation provides robust evidence contradicting the caption. Multiple reliable sources explicitly state that the circulating photograph is fabricated; it's a digitally altered version of an original image.  These sources detail how the original photo shows Trump's parents in regular attire and explain the process of alteration that added the robes and symbols, thus misrepresenting the scene.  The external check provides a high confidence score of 10, emphasizing the definitive nature of its findings. \n\nThe discrepancy between the internal and external checks highlights the importance of corroborating visual evidence with reliable external sources, especially for sensitive and potentially misleading content. The low confidence of the internal check underscores the limitations of visual analysis alone and the potential for manipulation.  The high confidence and strong evidence from external sources, however, convincingly demonstrate the falsity of the original caption.  The image has been manipulated, and the caption is therefore out of context and inaccurate.",

            "content": "An abandoned quarry in Nigeria has become a tourist hotspot after images were posted on social media earlier this month.\nThe rocky cliffs climbing into a blue sky, a moss-lined footpath, small green hills and a lake that shimmers in the sun are quite breath-taking and a set of images shared on Twitter at the beginning of August has been liked more than a thousand times.\nIn a matter of days of the post, the site, known as Crushed Rock, in Mpape - a poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of the capital Abuja - was thronged.\nThere has been a DJ stand, food vendors, hundreds of sun-bathing selfie-takers - and even a band of classical musicians.\nNigerians are not generally known to be outdoor lovers - the weather is very hot in the north and quite humid in the south.\nHowever, there is a burgeoning community of hikers around Abuja inspired by the many expatriates living in the political capital.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also had a part to play in encouraging these young middle-class Nigerians to explore the hills in the country's rocky central region.\nThe lockdown, which prevented people from travelling elsewhere, has meant that places closer to home are being explored.\nThe area around Mpape, which means \"rock\" in the local Gwari language, supplied much of the stone used to transform Abuja from a small village in the 1980s into the country's capital city.\n\"The quarry has existed for more than 10 years,\" said Mpape resident Courage Ebenz, who is somewhat bemused by the sudden influx of city-dwellers.\nNigeria has an abundance of sites of natural beauty, but this \"man-made\" location has its own appeal - with three main tiers that each give a stunning view of the water below.\nSightseers can choose a small winding footpath to the top terrace, where the grass is an ideal picnic location.\nThe more adventurous can continue down the path that circles and snakes down to the water's edge.\nBut a warning for the brave who might want to plunge into the water - the locals say it is full of abandoned machinery.\nAccording to Abraham Adepelumi, a geo-physicist at Obafemi Awolowo university, the lake was formed as a result of the fracturing of an aquifer.\n\"Once the rock got fractured, the water within the rock was under pressure,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It is a natural phenomenon, Mpape is a fracture-prone area of Abuja and has experienced tremors as recent as 2018.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nThe local emergency agency has warned amateurs against hiking at Mpape Crushed Rock, but fun-seekers seem not to be deterred.\n\"I didn't know we had such a place in Nigeria and I wanted to see if it is real,\" Elizabeth Okute, who came with her friends after seeing pictures on Facebook, told the BBC.\n\"I am surprised such a place exists in Abuja and I love what I am seeing,\" said Ann Chukwuka.\nEmeka Uko, who kept straying to the edge much to the chagrin of his friends, added: \"I hope we put measures in place to preserve it.\"\nThis is exactly what some volunteers decided to do last Saturday, clearing up a trail of plastic waste around the quarry that has built up over the last few weeks.\nThey split into two groups to compete to see who could collect the most rubbish - updating social media as they went.\n\"A lot of people felt it was their responsibility to clean up the place,\" Brandon Akume, whose group came second in the clean-up dash, told the BBC.\nThis was an alien concept to most Nigerians, he added.",

The internal check finds a high degree of confidence (score of 10) because the image clearly shows a woman who visually matches the description of Ann Chukwuka at a location consistent with Mpape Crushed Rock.  The external check further corroborates this with a confidence score of 10, citing a news source that directly quotes Ann Chukwuka confirming her presence at the location.  There are no discrepancies or uncertainties between the internal and external checks; both independently and congruently confirm the caption's accuracy.  The visual evidence aligns perfectly with the textual information, presenting no signs of manipulation or miscontextualization. The presence of other individuals in the background of the image adds to the contextual validity, showing a real-life scene and not a staged photograph. The high confidence scores (10/10 in both checks) reinforce the strong evidence supporting the caption's accuracy.  There's no indication of visual tampering; the image seems naturally captured, strengthening the trust in the information presented.  The visual details, including the landscape, the woman's attire and the other people present, are consistent with the caption and the supporting external source.  In summary, the robust alignment between the visual image, the internal analysis, and the external verification makes it highly improbable that the caption is out of context. Therefore, the conclusion is definitive and confident in the caption's accuracy.",

Internal validation notes that while the image shows Donald Trump with his mother and another man wearing a robe with symbols that *could* be associated with the KKK, the image alone is insufficient to confirm this definitively. The caption's claim is therefore uncertain based on visual evidence alone.  However, external validation from Snopes provides conclusive evidence that the image is a hoax, a manipulated image where the individuals were digitally altered to appear as if they are wearing KKK robes. Snopes presents the original unaltered image as proof.  There is complete agreement between internal and external evidence that the caption is inaccurate; the internal analysis only highlights the ambiguity of the manipulated image itself and does not endorse the claim made in the caption.  The discrepancy lies in the degree of certainty. Internal validation acknowledges uncertainty due to the image manipulation and the potential for misinterpretation, giving a lower confidence score. External validation, supported by Snopes's evidence, offers higher confidence in debunking the caption's claim because it presents irrefutable proof of the image's manipulation.  Given the definitive evidence from Snopes, the final verdict is that the caption is completely out of context, with a high confidence score of 10.  The visual evidence, once the manipulation is revealed, supports the external validation's conclusion. No other external sources were found that contradict Snopes's findings.",

            "content": "Awe-inspiring photographs of fast jets surrounded by a split-second shockwave arent evidence of a plane breaking the sound barrier. BBC Future looks at what causes them.\nIts an eye-catching sight that has been captured by photographers and camera crews time and again; a military jet sweeps in low and fast, travelling at hundreds of miles an hour. As it picks up speed, it begins to be surrounded by a giant cone of vapour, a cloud that seems to erupt around the aircraft.\nThat, were often told in excitable captions, is a sonic boom.\nExcept, it isnt  or at least, not quite. What youre seeing is a physical effect that takes place as an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, but its not the sonic boom itself.\nAs aircraft design has become more sophisticated, planes have become more streamlined, and faster  and begun to do things to the air around them that they just werent able to do when they were slower and more cumbersome. And the mystery shockwaves that surround, low, fast-flying planes as they approach and then pass the sound barrier are proof that the air starts to do some very strange things at such speeds.\nSo what are these mystery vapour cones?\nRod Irvine, the chairman of the Royal Aeronautical Societys aerodynamics group, says the conditions that create the vapour cone all lead toward the breaking of the sound barrier  but the cones are usually photographed at speeds just below the speed of sound.\nFlying so close to the ground, the air is denser and creates more friction and drag  and, anyway, pilots are banned from breaking the sound barrier over land. You can do it over the sea, he says, but you cant do it over the land. Its one of the things that the Concorde project suffered from because as Concorde was developed the rules changed which meant it could only break the sound barrier over water.\nThe shock waves are the physical effects of the aircraft travelling so fast through air, especially if its moist and warm, and affecting the air around it\nMoreover, capturing the shockwaves created when an aircraft passes the speed of sound are incredibly difficult  theyre much harder to pick up with the naked eye. You need special kit in order to see it. When photographing aerodynamic models being subjected to supersonic speeds in wind tunnels, scientists usually use mirrors to pick up the difference in light refraction from the resulting shockwaves. The resultant Schlieren photograph is then used to visualise the system of shockwaves around the wind tunnel model. In wind tunnel tests the models dont tend to create the same kind of vapour cones because the air is treated to take the moisture out of the air.\nThe vapour cones are created by a shockwave that is generated by the aircraft as it picks up speed. The shock waves are the physical effects of the aircraft travelling so fast through air. As the aircraft picks up speed, and approaches the speed of sound  around 767mph (1,234km/h) at sea level  shockwaves form around the aircraft. Across these shockwaves there is discontinuity in the local air pressure and temperature. This causes the air to lose its capacity to hold water and condensation starts to form, creating the vapour cone.\nIf you see a vapour cone, youve got a shockwave, because youve got a change in pressure and temperature, says Irvine.\nMany of the best pictures of this phenomenon feature aircraft flown by the US Navy; no accident, given that the warm, moist air close to the surface of the sea can help amplify the effect.\nIts a trick commonly performed by F-A/18 Hornet fighter-bombers, the mainstay of the US Navys carrier fleets. The Hornet is also used by the Blue Angels aerobatic team, and these pilots are adept at performing manoeuvres that creates these vapour cones  also known as shock collars or shock eggs. Moreover, theyre often done next to an aircraft carrier or out to sea, with trained US Navy photographers close to hand  taking a split-second picture of a jet travelling at 600mph (960km/h) is not something youre likely to capture in crystal-clear detail on your smartphone.\nThe air travelling around the wing can accelerate  and that can break the sound barrier  Rod Irvine\nJust to make things more complicated, the vapour cones are often the most dramatic when they take place in whats called transonic flight  thats when some of the air flowing around the aircraft is flowing at above the speed of sound, and some of it below.\nUltimately, he says, you need to have the right climactic conditions  the kind of warm moist air that aircraft operating off carriers can find easier than most. Then, get a nearby cameraman who really knows what theyre doing and voila  youve captured, on camera, the dramatic vapour cloud that so many of us think is the split-second spectacle of a sonic boom.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called If You Only Read 6 Things This Week.

The source emphasizes that vapor cones can occur at subsonic speeds, and capturing a visual of a true sonic boom is exceptionally difficult.  The discrepancy stems from the fact that the condensation cloud in the image is more consistent with a vapor cone than a shockwave associated with a sonic boom.  While the image shows an F-18, and a condensation cloud is present, this cloud doesn't definitively prove supersonic flight.  The external source casts doubt on the caption's assertion of a sonic boom, highlighting the visual challenges in capturing sonic booms and the common misinterpretation of vapor cones as evidence of supersonic speeds. The low confidence score reflects the significant difference in opinion between the internal and external checks.  There is no conclusive evidence that the image depicts the aircraft breaking the sound barrier and generating a sonic boom; hence, labeling it as 'out of context' is appropriate, but only with moderate certainty.

Internal validation shows a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly depicts a fire-breathing performance during what appears to be a protest.  The presence of signs and the context strongly suggest a protest against violence against women in Mexico City, aligning well with the caption. External validation supports this with a score of 8. While not a commonplace event, fire-breathing performances during protests are possible, and protests against gender-based violence are frequent in many parts of the world, including Mexico City, making this a plausible scenario.  The external check acknowledges the need for further verification to confirm the specific location and nature of the protest completely. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both indicate a strong likelihood that the caption is accurate. The visual evidence corroborates the textual information. There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The slight difference in confidence scores (10 vs 8) arises from the need for external confirmation of the protest's precise location and nature.  Overall, the image and caption align remarkably well,  and  the minor uncertainty from the external check doesn't significantly undermine the high internal confidence score. Therefore, the caption is deemed accurate, with a slightly lowered confidence score to account for the external validation's cautious approach.",

Internal validation confirms the visual depiction of a fire-breathing protest, and external validation supports the plausibility of such an event.

A generation later, the countrys journey provides a broader lesson: It is far easier to rally for an end to racism than it is to undo entrenched inequities and to govern a complicated country.\nThe African National Congress won the 1994 election on the promise of a better life for all. But for many that promise has fallen short. Polls now suggest that in the election scheduled for May 29, the party risks losing its absolute majority in the national government for the first time.\nNo one doubts that South Africa has made strides since the days of legalized racial oppression. Democracy has brought a growing Black middle class, access to better education across racial lines and a basic human dignity once stolen from the Black majority.\nBut there also has been a widening gap between rich and poor, a breakdown in basic services like electricity and water, and the continued isolation of Black families stuck in ramshackle homes in distant communities.\nBlack South Africans, who make up 81 percent of the population, often argue that theyve gained political freedom, but not economic freedom  and remain trapped in the structure of apartheid.\nWe went through the Freedom Charters declarations  each ending in an exclamation point  to measure South Africas progress and shortcomings over the past 30 years.\nOn a continent where coups, autocrats and flawed elections have become common, South Africa is a widely admired exception.\nSince 1994, the country has held national elections every five years, with local elections in between. Presidents have changed, but the party in power  the A.N.C.  never has. Despite this, there have never been any serious doubts about the integrity of those electoral contests. A record 52 parties will compete in the national election this year.\nDespite the electoral stability, politics have been dangerous. Fierce conflict within the A.N.C. has resulted in many assassinations over the years. The A.N.C.s access to state resources as the governing party has fueled many of the disputes and led to widespread corruption  from top national officials down to local councilors.\nThe enrichment of A.N.C. leaders while many people barely earn enough to feed themselves has shaken the faith of many South Africans in their democratic system.\nLast year, 22 percent of South Africans approved of the functioning of the countrys democracy, down from 63 percent in 2004, according to surveys from the Human Sciences Research Council.\nUnder apartheid, race restricted every aspect of life for South Africans who were Black, Indian and colored  a multiracial classification created by the government. There were strict limits on where they could live, attend school, work and travel. Laws enforced this segregation, and partaking in politics was criminalized.\nBut the democratic government drafted a constitution that enshrined equal rights for all.\nSouth Africa has become a place where people of all races often dine, worship and party together. Gay rights are largely accepted. There is a free and vigorous press, and protests and open political debate are a part of life.\nBut many of the economic barriers created under apartheid still endure.\nBy one measure, the World Bank has ranked South Africa as the most unequal country in the world. Ten percent of the population holds about 71 percent of the countrys wealth, while the bottom 60 percent holds just 7 percent of assets, according to the World Bank.\nTo a large extent, the wealth disparities have kept millions of Black South Africans relegated to some of the most deplorable conditions.\nJust look at the place in the Soweto community of Kliptown where hundreds of anti-apartheid activists gathered to draft the Freedom Charter in 1955. It is now known as Walter Sisulu Square, named for a prominent anti-apartheid activist.\nNearly two decades ago, the government built a large concrete complex around the square, with restaurants, offices and a hotel. But because of a lack of maintenance and huge riots in 2021 that stemmed from political grievances, most of the businesses are now gutted, littered and stinking of sewage. Informal traders eke out a living nearby selling sandwiches, clothes and fruit.\nAcross adjacent railroad tracks sits an all-Black neighborhood where most residents live in tin shacks, use outdoor latrines, rely on jury-rigged wires for electricity and navigate craggy dirt roads.\nJack Martins, 54, who lives in the neighborhood, had a cellphone repair shop in the complex, but it did not survive the riots. He now plies his trade from a table on the sidewalk. He secured public housing, but had to pay a bribe to get it, he said. Two of his sons could not get into university because there was not enough space, and his daughter, despite having a mechanical engineering degree, has been unable to find stable work. He is fed up with the near-daily, hourslong electricity outages caused by the failing state power utility.\nWhat is this government doing for us? he said. Absolutely nothing.\nThe Black middle and upper classes have grown significantly. In 1995, just 350,000 Black South Africans lived in households that were among the top 15 percent in income, according to researchers at the University of Cape Towns Liberty Institute of Strategic Marketing. By 2022, that number had grown to about 5.6 million.\nStill, Black families are underrepresented among rich households.\nMany expected something better this far into democracy. Much of the nations wealth remains in white hands.\nBlack South Africans had a stake in only 29 percent of the companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, according to a 2022 report by South Africas Black Economic Empowerment Commission. Not a single entity on the exchange was fully Black-owned, the report said.\nEconomists say the countrys economy never took off enough to allow for a greater redistribution of wealth. Even when South Africa experienced its strongest stretch of economic growth in the first decade and a half of democracy, it still lagged behind its peers in Africa and other upper-middle-income countries. Since then, growth has been tepid, and contraction since the Covid-19 pandemic has been sharper than that in similarly sized economies.\nGovernment rules have allowed Black South Africans to gain a greater stake in industries like mining, where Black ownership has grown from 2 percent to 39 percent over the past two decades. But the gains have gone to relatively few people at the top.\nHowever, the Bafokeng kingdom, an ethnic group within South Africa, has shown what is possible when a community gets its fair share of its resource wealth. The kingdom sits on rich platinum deposits. After a court victory in 1999 that affirmed its land rights, the kingdom used its platinum dividends to build a school with a large campus and a modern clinic, and to invest in other industries. Most families live in large brick homes that are the envy of other rural villages.\nAt the end of apartheid, when almost all of South Africas agricultural land was white-owned, Mr. Mandelas government pledged in 1994 to transfer 30 percent of it into Black hands within a few years, by encouraging white landowners to sell.\nThe government failed to meet its goal, and it stretched the deadline to 2030. So far, about 25 percent of white-owned farmland has been transferred to Black ownership, mostly through the purchase of land by the government or Black individuals, according to Wandile Sihlobo and Johann Kirsten, agricultural economists at Stellenbosch University.\nWhite South Africans make up roughly 7 percent of the population, but white-owned farms still cover about half of the countrys entire surface area, according to Mr. Sihlobo and Mr. Kirsten.\nIn the first decade of democracy, the government gave Black people full ownership of the white-owned farms it had bought. Owning the land meant that Black families had the chance not only to feed and support themselves but also advance.\nBut the government is no longer giving land to Black South Africans outright, offering long-term leases instead, Mr. Sihlobo and Mr. Kirsten said. Without ownership, Black farmers cannot generate wealth by using the land as collateral to get a bank loan. That has prevented Black farmers from expanding their operations to be commercially competitive.\nOnly about 7 percent of commercial-scale farms  those that sell to major grocers or export their products  are Black-owned. Only about 10 percent of the food produced by commercial farms in South Africa comes from Black-owned farms, about the same share as in the 1980s, Mr. Sihlobo said.\nIn the first decade of democracy, more than 930,000 mostly Black and colored farm workers were evicted from farms despite new laws intended to allow them to spend their lives on the farms where they worked.\nWe havent been able to live up to those ideals of Black land ownership, Mr. Sihlobo said.\nBlack South Africans are unemployed at far higher rates than their white peers, and that disparity has not improved over time.\nThe high unemployment rate has given rise to a hustle culture that sends many South Africans to the streets early each morning in search of work.\nZinhle Nene, 49, has been waking up by 5:30 a.m. most days and waiting on a corner in downtown Johannesburg with hundreds of others seeking day jobs. She left her low-paying job as a home health aide because the transportation to work was too expensive.\nIts heartbreaking because we come here and we dont even have food, she said, wiping away tears as the hours passed. Sometimes, you even get home, theres nothing. You just drink water and then you sleep.\nPoverty has decreased since the start of democracy. Still, it remains very high. Nearly two out of every three Black South Africans lived below the upper-bound poverty line in 2015  the most recent data available  meaning they had access to less than about $80 a month. Only 1 percent of white South Africans lived below that line.\nPeter Mokoena broke down in tears last November inside the modest two-bedroom house the government had just given him. It sat alongside dozens of other homes just like it, on the freshly paved roads of a new subdivision about half an hour southeast of Johannesburg.\nIm so happy, happy, happy, happy for this house, said Mr. Mokoena, 74, who had been living in a tin shack so leaky that his furniture was soaked when it rained. Now, it feels like I'm in heaven.\nThe government has built 3.4 million houses since 1994, and given ownership of most of them for free to poor South Africans. Some units, known as social housing, are rented out at below-market rates. The government also has embarked on several mega city projects, in partnership with the private sector, to cluster together various types of housing and services like day care centers.\nMany South Africans have moved into formal homes from makeshift structures, and access to basic services like electricity and piped water has increased. But frequent power and water outages have made those services unreliable, leading to anger and frustration nationwide.\nMr. Mokoena waited 27 years for his house. Many are still waiting. In the meantime, some squat in downtown buildings. Others build shacks in any open space they can find. Or they rent small backyard units built behind houses  an effort the government is supporting.\nNew government housing has often ended up in areas far from jobs and economic activity, perpetuating the apartheid system of marginalizing Black people to outlying townships.\nNokuthula Mabe anxiously sat on her suitcase in the February heat outside North-West University in the city of Mahikeng, waiting with about a dozen other high-school graduates hoping for a spot. The university had received more than 181,000 applications for 11,717 slots.\nIn many ways, Ms. Mabe epitomized post-apartheid progress simply by graduating from her overcrowded village school near the Botswana border.\nIn the 1950s, only 10 percent of Black children finished high school. By 2021, that number had risen to 58 percent, according to government statistics.\nDespite these gains, significant racial disparities persist.\nIn 1982, the apartheid government spent roughly $1,100 a year on education for each white child but just $140 for each Black child, according to Section 27, a human rights organization.\nBy 2018, that had increased to about $1,400 for each child, according to researchers at Stellenbosch University, much of it intended to level the playing field for Black students.\nBut schools are still failing many of their students. A report published in 2022 found that 81 percent of Grade 4 students could not understand what they were reading.\nAnd while more children are finishing high school, there are not enough seats in colleges to meet the demand.\nIn 2022, about 6 percent of South Africans aged 18 to 29 were enrolled in higher education, according to Statistics South Africa. These enrollment rates lag behind countries with similarly sized economies, like Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, according to figures from the World Bank.\nAfter waiting nervously for hours, Ms. Mabe, 18, dragged her suitcase to the nearest bus stop to begin the three-and-a-half-hour trip back to her village. The university was too full to admit her.\nDuring apartheid, the judicial system was used to criminalize Black people, mete out harsh punishment and cover up the atrocities committed against them.\nToday, the judiciary is seen as among the most credible institutions in the country. Judges have upheld human rights and taken tough stances against even powerful political figures like the former president Jacob Zuma, who was sentenced to prison for contempt.\nStill, as in many other countries, the South African justice system works best for those with money. A government commission found two years ago that most South Africans could not afford legal fees. The agency providing legal assistance for the poor is underfunded and overburdened.\nThose with very deep pockets are able to take the criminal justice process, stretch it for a very long period of time, said Chrispin Phiri, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services. Thats a privilege not afforded to a poorer person.\nWhats more, the justice system does not seem to be taming the countrys high crime rate.\nAlthough the murder rate is lower than it was in 1994, it has climbed steadily since 2012.\nOn paper, South Africas legal system prioritizes rehabilitating prisoners. The government offers an array of restorative justice, jobs and counseling programs for inmates and those being released.\nIn reality, though, prison-reform activists and studies suggest that treatment behind bars can be harsh and access to education difficult.\nInternationally, South Africa has tried to position itself as a broker of peace and a leader in challenging a Western-led world order.\nSouth Africa is the S in the BRICS group of nations that also includes Brazil, Russia, India and China, formed as a counterpoint to American and European alliances.\nSouth Africa has played a critical role over the years in peace missions in African countries like Ethiopia, Burundi and Zimbabwe. And President Cyril Ramaphosa led a peace delegation last year to Ukraine and Russia, while refusing to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSouth Africa argues that as a midsize nation, it cannot afford to choose sides and must make friends with everyone.\nBut it has been accused of being hypocritical and selectively concerned about peace and human rights.\nThe government brought a genocide case this year in the International Court of Justice against Israel for its war in Gaza after the attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7. South African officials have argued that Palestinians face a situation similar to apartheid.\nFor all of the frustrations that South Africans may have about the past 30 years, democracy has brought something that money and data cannot measure: freedom.\nAs in, freedom to go where you want, to date whom you want, to complain and advocate change as loudly as you want.\nThat has driven Sibusiso Zikode, 48, for much of his adult life.\nHe arrived in Durban, a port city on South Africas east coast, and started law school, but dropped out in the first term when his family savings ran out.\nHe moved to Kennedy Road, a slum built on muddy slopes and surrounded by a landfill, joining thousands who had flocked to the city for opportunity, only to find themselves in zinc shacks. This didnt feel like freedom.\nSo, he helped to establish Abahlali baseMjondolo, a protest movement that is one of many that represent the revolt of poor people. Between July and September in 2022, the South African police responded to 2,455 protests.\nBut going up against the post-apartheid political establishment has come at great cost: Leaders of Abahlali have been assassinated, and Mr. Zikode had to flee from his home at the squatter camp after deadly attacks.\nAbahlalis members are growing more disillusioned with democracy.\nWhoever is homeless now, Mr. Zikode said, will be homeless after the election.",

            "content": "A group of US-bound Central American migrants has been met with truncheons and tear gas in Guatemala, where security forces blocked their path.\nThousands of people were intercepted on a road near the border with Honduras on Sunday. The government said it would not accept \"illegal mass movements\".\nAn estimated 7,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, have entered in recent days, fleeing poverty and violence.\nThey hope to travel on to Mexico, and then the US border.\nEvery year, tens of thousands of Central American migrants attempt this perilous journey to try and reach the US, often on foot, in groups known as \"caravans\".\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has vowed to end the strict immigration policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, a Republican.\nBut the Biden administration, which will take office on Wednesday, has warned migrants not to make the journey, as immigration policies will not change overnight.\nWhat happened when the group entered Guatemala?\nAs the migrants trekked across Guatemala towards its border with Mexico, they were slowed down by security forces near the south-eastern village of Vado Hondo.\nA group of soldiers and police officers blockaded a road, stopping many of them from advancing. Some people still attempted to force their way through, prompting security forces to push them back. Several people were injured.\nMany migrants retreated, with some waiting nearby to make a new attempt later. Others fled into nearby mountains.\n\"Fortunately the security forces established a contingency plan... and contained this battle,\" said Guillermo Daz, head of Guatemala's migration agency.\nA statement from the Guatemalan president's office said: \"Guatemala's message is loud and clear: These types of illegal mass movements will not be accepted, that's why we are working together with the neighbouring nations to address this as a regional issue.\"\nThe government later said 21 migrants who had sought medical assistance tested positive for Covid-19.\nWhy are so many people coming now?\nThe migrants say persecution, violence and poverty are a daily reality in their home countries. Conditions have been made worse by the devastation wrought by two huge hurricanes that battered Central America last November.\n\"There is still mud everywhere there, everything got knocked down, we lost everything,\" Ismael Eliazar told the Associated Press news agency.\nSo, in search of a better life, they want to reach the US in the hope of finding work and safety.\nDania Hinestrosa, a 23-year-old travelling with her daughter, told the AFP news agency: \"We have no work, nor food, so I decided to go to the United States.\"\nThe promise of new immigration policies under Mr Biden's administration is also thought to have spurred some migrants to make an attempt to reach the US border.\nWhat is the incoming US administration saying?\nMembers of Mr Biden's team have warned Central American migrants not to make dangerous journeys to the border.\nSpeaking to NBC News, an unnamed senior Biden administration official said migrants attempting to claim asylum in the US \"need to understand they're not going to be able to come into the United States immediately\".\nThe Biden administration will prioritise undocumented immigrants already living in the US, not those heading to the country now, the official said.\n\"Processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off,\" Susan Rice, one of Mr Biden's policy advisers, told the Spanish language news agency Efe in December.\n\"Migrants and asylum seekers should absolutely not believe those in the region selling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on day one. It will not.\"\nMark Morgan, acting commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, last week urged would-be migrants at the southern border not to \"waste your time and money\".\nThe US commitment to the \"rule of law and public health\" is not affected by the change in administration, he said in a statement.",

Considering the low confidence from external validation and the uncertainties revealed by the internal assessment, the caption is deemed out of context.  The discrepancy stems from the fact that while the image depicts a scene consistent with a large group leaving a significant amount of debris behind,  this alone isn't sufficient to definitively link it to the specific Honduran refugee caravan mentioned.  Additional evidence, such as geographical location markers, or explicit confirmation within news reports, would be needed to confidently verify the caption.  Without such corroboration, the image remains ambiguous, and the caption's claim of depicting garbage left behind by a specific Honduran refugee caravan remains unsubstantiated.

            "content": "Earlier this year, millions of women lined up to form a human \"wall\" of protest to call for gender equality in India. The story is one of many from our blog that we're highlighting for International Women's Day  dedicated to celebrating the achievements of women in all arenas: social, economic, cultural, political and personal.\nTo highlight the March 8 commemoration, here are some of the remarkable women and women's movements we've covered over the past year.\nThe millions of Indian women who formed a 385-mile \"wall\" of protest\nOn New Year's Day of this year, somewhere between 3.5 million and 5 million women lined up on National Highway 66, a long stretch of road that runs along India's western coast. The \"wall\" stretched out 385 miles.\nThe demonstration was planned to create awareness of gender equality  and to protest a religious ban that prevented women of menstruating age from entering one of the country's sacred Hindu temples even after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of their entry on Sept. 28 last year.\nFor Rakhee Madhavan, a 39-year-old teacher, and many other participants, the motive was not a political or religious issue but a deeply personal one that transcended the temple ban.\n\"I've heard so many older women say that they're impure when they're menstruating and it's disturbing,\" she says. \"I didn't want the impressionable young girls I teach to imbibe the same message. I wanted to be a part of this because I believe it's time for awareness and for change.\"\nRead the story here.\nThe women who dare to bicycle in Pakistan\nZulekha Dawood organizes a weekly bike ride for women and girls in Karachi. She had previously run a girls boxing club and saw some boys on bikes nearby. \"If they can ride,\" Dawood thought, \"why shouldn't we?\"\nIt is a rare endeavor in conservative Pakistan, where few women dare to cycle. It is seen as a vulgar and sexlike act because a woman must straddle a seat.\nThere's been pushback. Male students at a madrassa once confronted them. \"They were kicking the girls,\" she recalled, and she heard them shout, \"Why don't your brothers stop you? Cover yourself and go pray! Go home!\"\nSo she created a route away from the madrassa. She believes that women have a right to move freely, she says. \"This is empowerment,\" she says. \"We feel good. We feel free. We can go anywhere.\"\nRead the story here.\nThe teenage sisters who said \"bye bye\" to plastic bags in Bali\nFive years ago, two teenage sisters decided to do something about the plastic problem on their island of Bali.\nAnd Bye Bye Plastic Bags was born.\nMelati and Isabel Wijsen got the idea in 2013 after a lesson at school about world leaders.\n\"My sister and I went home that day thinking, 'Well, what can we do as kids living on the island of Bali?' \" Melati says.\nThe answer was literally right in front of them  on the beach by their home.\n\"It got to the point where on weekends when we would go to our childhood beach, if we went swimming there, a plastic bag would wrap around your arm,\" she says. \"And you say, just, enough is enough.\"\nThey went online and discovered that more than 40 countries had already banned or taxed plastic bags.\n\"We thought, 'Well, if they can do it, c'mon, Bali! C'mon, Indonesia! We can do it, too!' \" Melati says.\nRead their story here.\nThe Kenyan woman who fought for dignity during childbirth\nIn August 2013, Josephine Majani came to on a hard hallway floor in the Bungoma District Hospital in Bungoma, Kenya.\nMajani heard nurses yelling: \"I saw them carry the baby away. They screamed at me, 'Why have you delivered on the floor? Who is going to clean up all this blood? Get up. Get your things and go back to the delivery room.' I was helpless.\"\nMajani has no memory of being slapped, she says, but when she regained consciousness her cheeks stung. And her experience was captured on video.\nIn February of this year, the court issued a landmark ruling awarding Majani $25,000 in damages, requiring that hospital staff formally apologize to her and setting a precedent that demands women be given quality care and treated with dignity during childbirth.\nRead the full story here.\nThe woman who was once enslaved by ISIS  and won a Nobel Peace Prize\nIn August 2014, Nadia Murad was one of thousands of women from the Yazidi minority in northern Iraq who were captured by ISIS and forced into sexual slavery. Three months later, she escaped through a door that a captor left unlocked.\nShe has shared her painful story with international media outlets and has become a voice for captive women and girls in the process.\nMurad urges women who have faced sexual violence to reclaim their lives. \"The hope of ISIS was to break the Yazidi community,\" she says. \"But for survivors especially, going back to their lives and getting married and making a life and working, it's basically making sure ISIS did not succeed.\"\nIn 2016, she was named the U.N.'s first Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking.\nIn 2018, she became the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Dr. Denis Mukwege, a gynecologist from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who treats victims of rape.\nRead the full story here.\nThe woman who became Freetown, Sierra Leone's first female mayor in nearly 40 years\nYvonne Aki-Sawyerr, who was elected mayor of Freetown in May 2018, is the city's first female mayor in nearly 40 years.\nAki-Sawyerr, 50, says she decided to run for mayor after overseeing Operation Clean Freetown, a government effort that was part of a large post-Ebola recovery program that started in 2016. The project aimed to \"[reduce] the risk of epidemics by improving solid waste management in the city.\"\n\"I came face to face with how bad things were\" in Freetown, Aki-Sawyerr explains over a late breakfast of boiled cassava root after returning to her office from her meeting. \"I decided I had to run.\"\nShe expanded this work as mayor. Her first task in office was to identify the locations with the most egregiously clogged gutters that were missed in Operation Clean Freetown and have them cleared so water could flow.",

The date is not explicitly shown but could be inferred to be a special occasion, consistent with the \"New Year's Day\" claim. The uncertainty lies in the precise number of women and the exact location.\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check provides a confidence score of 10, offering strong supporting evidence. It cites a source explicitly stating that millions of women lined up on National Highway 66 in Kerala on New Year's Day to create this human chain or \"wall.\"  This corroborates the caption's core claim.  This source fills in the details missing in the image and internal analysis, such as the precise location, the approximate number of participants, and the date.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nThe main discrepancy is the quantitative difference. The caption says \"millions,\" while the external source specifies \"between 3.5 million and 5 million.\" This is a difference in scale but not in the fundamental claim.  Another minor uncertainty is the exact identification of the location from the image alone, though the external source provides this information.  The day (New Year's Day) is supported by the external source but is not explicitly visible in the image.\n\nVisual Evidence:\nThe image shows a significant number of women standing closely together in a line, which visually aligns with the concept of a \"women's wall.\" However, the image alone does not provide concrete evidence of the exact location, the precise number of participants, nor the exact date.\n\nFinal Assessment:\nThe internal analysis provides plausible support, but the external evidence adds crucial details and strengthens the confidence significantly. Considering both assessments, the caption is not out of context.  The minor discrepancies are quantitative and related to details not directly observable in the image.  The external source lends a high level of credibility to the original caption.  Therefore, the final confidence score is set to 9, reflecting the high level of agreement and the additional information provided by the external source.",

Donald Trump believe Americans became lazy with all of the government assistance programs that the government offer the people. Donald Trump recently said \"Americans will no longer be able to be lazy, and depend on the government to take care of them\".\nMany working American believe a lot of government assistance programs need to be abolished. One of them programs are Section 8. Why do a such program exist anyway? Well Donald Trump doesn't believe in any of it and believe working citizens of America would like to see their tax money being spent in better ways than taking care of able working Americans that simply refuse to. Even though there are working Americans that are on Section 8, 75% of Section 8 recipients go through numerous jobs, and some refuse to work at all.\nAnother program Donald Trump doesn't believe in is Welfare. Although he openly admitted that he see the point in the program, he don't think Americans understand that if should be used to help those get on their feet instead of a reliable source of income. He believe American need to recreate jobs and recreate American Businesses that other countries are now benefiting from.\nThe article's lack of any substantiating material should have been a clue that it was not a real story. Had Trump made any sort of divisive or racist assertion of the sort (such as implying that social programs like Section 8 housing exist solely to benefit black people), those comments would have been unquestionably newsworthy in the wake of his upset victory in the 2016 election.\nUnited States presidents are not vested with the power to either create or pass laws on their own:\nThe president does not have the power to create or rewrite legislation  that is Congresss job. He is not authorized to dispense with or suspend the law. British kings made this practice familiar to the Framers of the Constitution, who deliberately chose to deny such a power to the president ... lets start by referring to the Constitution. Article II charges the president with the duty to carry out the law  to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.",

Clintons impeachment charge stemmed from a sexual harassment case, in which Lewinsky, then a White House intern, became famously intertwined following an independent councils investigation into sexual encounters between Lewinsky and Clinton.\nThe viral image in question displays Lewinskys real Twitter profile picture and handle.

Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option.\nHere's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history.\nWhat's it all about?\nMr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour.\nUS intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media.\nBoth the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of \"collusion\", with Mr Trump calling it \"the greatest political witch hunt in history\".\nWhat contact do we know about?\nAt least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according to an analysis of public records by the New York Times, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications.\nTrump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.\nThe president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters.\nWho's been charged?\nThe special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies.\nWho is special counsel Robert Mueller?\nA former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0.\nWith a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation.\nOn 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign.\nWhat does Mueller's report say?\nThe 448-page report painted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president.\nMr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime.\n\"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,\" the report says.\n\"Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\"\nIt also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged \"conflicts of interest\", but the lawyer resigned.\nAround 10% of the public report is redacted.\nHow many investigations have been conducted?\nAs well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations:\nThe Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides\nThe House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials\nThe Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow\nMeanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia\nAll of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January.\nThe Senate committee has yet to release its findings.\nWhat does Barr's summary say?\nBefore the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report before issuing his interpretation to Congress.\nThere was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI.\nBut legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of \"corrupt intent\".\nIn his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: \"The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'.\"\nMr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence \"to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence\".\nWhat next?\nMr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month.\nHe said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump \"clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so\".\nMr Mueller added that \"the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process.\nThe special counsel said he did not believe it was \"appropriate to speak further\" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report.\nBut the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story.\nThe former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice.\nMr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements.\nDemocrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety.\nWhat happened with James Comey?\nBack in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials.\nThen-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation.\nThe FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\"\nMr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting.\nA few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing \"this Russia thing\", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up.\nWhat about the Don Jr meeting?\nPart of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.\nThe meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would \"incriminate\" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be \"very useful to your father\". It was part of the Russian government's \"support\" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: \"I love it.\"\nMr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only \"inane nonsense\" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity \"in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently\".\nIn an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research.\nIn June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was \"to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics\".\nPresident Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry.\nSee our full Russia timeline.\nWhy are the Stone charges significant?\nThe arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama.\nThe charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct.\nThe information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign.\nIt means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling.\nWho is 'coffee boy' George Papadopoulos?\nMr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had \"political dirt\" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign.\nIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia.\nHe falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone.\nEmails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter.\nJust before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had \"never met a single Russian official\". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled \"Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump\".\nWhat is the Christopher Steele dossier?\nIn January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia.\nThe dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this.\nThe file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president.\nMr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.\nFusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump.\nHow did Russia (allegedly) hack a US election?\nIt didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier.\nThe special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called \"phishing\" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords.\nHackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details.\nWhat did Obama know and when?\nAccording to the Washington Post, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election.\nThe FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way.\nAccording to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet.\nOther intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow.\nWarnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name.\nHow does impeachment work?\nThe president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses.\nSeveral of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political.\nHowever, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss.\nAs for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded.\nIn the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president.\nThat's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage.\nWith a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.",

The internal assessment relies on assumptions (e.g., the children's identities, the reason for the rainbow) that the external check fails to support. Because of this critical discrepancy and lack of external validation, the final assessment concludes that the caption is likely out of context.

The holiday's overarching purpose is to celebrate the lives of women and focus on female empowerment.\nSinging, reciting poetry, dancing and eating are customary - and all this takes place without the presence of men.\nIn some countries, like Tunisia, girls that have recently turned 12 will group together and celebrate their Bat Mitzvah, or coming of age ceremony, on Eid El Bannat.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sephardic Moroccan artist La La Tamar said that in different countries they have varied rituals, but in Morocco and Tunisia its mainly for the bachelorettes\".\n\"They make a lot of sweets and give each other gifts.

There are stress factors in relation to the pressure of work, because it is overwhelming,\" Baguma Filbert Bates, the General Secretary of Uganda's National Teachers Union told BBC's Newsday programme.\nHe added that Ugandan teachers are constantly stressed by an overwhelming workload caused by understaffing, as well as a paycheck of about 490,000 Ugandan shillings ($125; 100) per month. Mr Bates said this amount is inadequate in sustaining teachers and their families in the current economic environment.\nHe said the union has repeatedly urged the government to improve teachers' welfare, which would in turn boost the quality of education received by students.\n\"Whenever there is need for political priorities, money is found. Therefore, we cannot say the Ugandan child should be sacrificed because of the economy,\" Mr Bates said.\nUgandan serial killer sentenced to 105 years in prison\nThe High Court in Uganda's capital, Kampala, has sentenced a 25-year-old serial killer to 105 years in prison.\nMusa Musasizi was sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty to the murder of three women said to be his girlfriends and a three-month-old girl who was the child of one of his victims.\nHe reportedly pursued romantic relationships with the women before sexually assaulting and killing them, then burning and disposing of their bodies, the court heard.\nJustice Margaret Mutonyi said the long sentence was necessary to protect young women, including Musasizi's six-year-old daughter, the privately-owned NTV channel reported.\nMusasizi had been arrested in March 2021 on suspicion of killing five women and an infant.\nHe was convicted for the murder of one of the women in July.\nAt that time, his lawyer asked the judge for mercy, saying that Musasizi, a former street child, had survived a difficult upbringing.\nNiger sets deadline for French troops withdrawal\nYusuf Akinpelu\nBBC News\nNigers junta has said French soldiers remaining in the country should complete their withdrawal by 22 December.\nThe remaining 157 troops are mainly from teams covering logistics, the junta said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). It added that 1,346 French military personnel have already left the country.\nThere have been tensions between France and Niger following the 26 July coup, led by Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, that deposed democratically-elected president and French ally Mohamed Bazoum.\nFrance began to pull its troops out from Niger in October. The junta had ordered the French to leave, having accused the European nation of trying to reinstate President Bazoum by force.\nThe military leaders also said they plan to end some historical military and economic agreements with Paris.\nNiger was seen as one of the Wests last allies in the Sahel region in the war against terror.\nFrances influence in the area has been waning following a wave of coups across some of its former colonies.\nM23 rebels welcome ceasefire ahead of DR Congo elections\nBBC Monitoring\nThe world through its media\nThe M23 rebel group has agreed to honour a three-day US-brokered ceasefire deal with the Democratic Republic of Congo's army.\nThe groups spokesman, Lawrence Kanyuka, said in a statement on X, external (formerly Twitter) that the rebels accepted the deal since it is in line with the M23's existing signed ceasefire of 7 March 2023.\nThe rebel group had not consulted about the deal before its completion, according to Mr Kanyuka.\nDespite agreeing to the ceasefire, the M23 said they would \"not hesitate\" to defend themselves - and the civillian populations under their control - from the army or government-allied militia.\nThe ceasefire began on Monday midday, according to a statement, external by US National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson.\nIt comes one week ahead of hotly contested elections in the central African country. Authorities have said voting cannot take place in the eastern territories of Rutshuru and Masisi, as they are in the grip of the conflict with the M23.\nAnd on Tuesday, the electoral commission announced that those displaced by the conflict will also not be able to vote.\nPrevious ceasefire deals between the rebels and army have been breached, leading to fresh fighting.\nEgypts Sisi takes poll lead as vote count begins\nEgypt's electoral body has started counting votes following the conclusion of polling in the presidential elections.\nVoting began on Sunday and ended at 21:00 local time on Tuesday (19:00 GMT), with more than 67 million people registered to vote.\nIncumbent President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is seeking a third consecutive term.\nAlthough three other candidates are vying for the presidency, many Egyptians believe Mr Sisi will easily win a new six-year term in office.\nEarly provisional results have already placed Mr Sisi in the lead.\nThe official results are set to be announced on 18 December.\nRead more on Egypt's election:\nEgypt election: Discontent grows as Sisi seeks third term\nCameroon army rescues kidnapped, 'tortured' students\nPaul Njie\nBBC News, Yaound\nEight male students who had been abducted by suspected separatists from a school in the war-torn Anglophone north-west region of Cameroon have been freed, authorities say.\nAbdoullahi Aliou, a local administrator, said the armed men stormed the school in Esu area on Tuesday and \"tortured\" the students before abducting them.\nTwo classrooms and the principal's offices were set on fire during the attack. Some school officials, including the deputy principal, were also kidnapped.\nSeveral students who sustained injuries are being treated in hospital.\nThe eight students who were kidnapped were all freed following the intervention of defence and security forces, Mr Aliou said, without providing details of the whereabouts of the deputy principal and other school officials.\nFor over six years now, separatists have imposed and enforced a school boycott in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon. The separatists see schools as an arm of the French-speaking-majority's rule.\nThe separatists have attacked students and teachers who defy their orders.\nNo group has so far claimed responsibility for Tuesdays attack.\nMore than 700,000 children have lost access to education after the closure of several schools since the conflict began in 2017, according to the UN.\nAbout 6,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the conflict, the International Crisis Group said.\nDR Congo signs carbon credit deal covering Congo basin\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo has signed an agreement with a US company for a carbon credit deal covering the Congo Basin rainforest and peatlands.\ndClimate, a \"climate information and data infrastructure\" company, said it will support DR Congo to preserve the Basin by reducing deforestation. The deal is aimed at preserving more than 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the forest.\nIn recent years, environmentalists have raised alarm over the depletion of thousands of acres in the Congo Basin through deforestation.\nAs the second-largest rainforest in the world, it absorbs over 1.5 billion tonnes of CO annually. Experts say preserving the Congo Basin is integral in global efforts to slow climate change and maintain biodiversity.\nCarbon credits work like this: an organisation that pollutes can buy a credit which is worth one tonne of carbon dioxide.\nThe money paid by the organisation is meant to go towards carbon-lowering schemes, so for every tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted, the credit represents a tonne of CO2 that was captured.\nIn this way, the overall amount of (CO2) and other pollutants produced is supposed to stay the same, or even be lowered.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in carbon-offsetting companies taking control of land in sub-Saharan Africa for multi-year carbon-credit projects. Some critics question whether credits represent genuine carbon reductions and also whether they benefit local people.\ndClimate said it will help DR Congo develop a carbon registry - a system through which the government will track and sell credits.\n\"dClimate will lease the carbon sequestration rights for an initial 10-year period but will not lease or buy the land, thus preserving the national sovereignty and the rights of local communities,\" the company said on Tuesday, following the signing of the agreement at the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai.\nThe credits produced during the decade-long partnership will be worth an estimated $1bn, dClimate's co-founder Siddhartha Jha told Bloomberg.\nThe company will retain 10% to 20% of generated revenue.",

            "content": "Claim:\nA picture shows a new animal species that's \"taking over\" at Chernobyl.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn January 2021, a picture of a strange, four-legged animal appeared in an online advertisement about the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear-reactor disaster in Ukraine. The ad claimed: \"There Are a New Animal Species Taking Over at Chernobyl.\"\nEncyclopedia Brittanica published that the Chernobyl incident was \"the worst disaster in the history of nuclear power generation.\" History.com reported much the same:\nChernobyl is a nuclear power plant in Ukraine that was the site of a disastrous nuclear accident on April 26, 1986. A routine test at the power plant went horribly wrong, and two massive explosions blew the 1,000-ton roof off one of the plants reactors, releasing 400 times more radiation than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The worst nuclear disaster in history killed two workers in the explosions and, within months, at least 28 more would be dead by acute radiation exposure. Eventually, thousands of people would show signs of health effectsincluding cancerfrom the fallout.\nHowever, the clickbait picture in the ad did not depict a \"new animal species\" that was \"taking over at Chernobyl.\" The resulting 30-page slideshow article didn't even mention the photograph.\nIn reality, it showed a spectacled (hairless) Andean bear named Dolores.\nOn Nov. 5, 2009, BBC reported that Dolores and two other bears were dealing with \"various states of baldness.\"\nThey came \"from the Andean mountains of Ecuador, Peru, and northern Bolivia.\"\nThe bears - named Dolores, Bianca, and Lolita - are suffering from itchiness as well, so animal keepers apply ointments to soothe their skin.\n\"This problem with the spectacled bears is not just in Leipzig [Zoo],\" Mr. Noetzhold told the BBC World Service. \"There are other zoos in Europe and overseas having the same problem. And so we've had an international working group of zoo vets looking at this for some time already.\"\nGerard Baars, director of the International Bear Foundation, said he had never seen such a condition before. \"I could hardly believe it is a bear although I have been dealing with bears all my life,\" he told the BBC's Europe Today programme.\nThe picture in the advertisement was perhaps chosen for the reason mentioned by Baars. Even the director of the International Bear Foundation didn't know it was a bear. Readers who saw the ad likely wouldn't initially identify the animal as a bear, either.\nJan Woitas and the European Pressphoto Agency were credited for the photograph that was used in the ad. It appeared to be from 2009.\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/germany-animals-nov-2009-8209359b\nAlso on Nov. 5, 2009, the Associated Press posted a video of Dolores, Bianca, and Lolita at the Leipzig Zoo. The zoo official, who was not identified, spoke of research that was underway about the issue with the bears. He also mentioned that other zoos had seen similar problems with such bears.\nAt least two blogs mentioned that Dolores died in 2011. We were unable to confirm this information with any credible source. However, one thing we can say for sure is that she was not a \"new species\" that was \"taking over at Chernobyl.\"\nFor further reading, Scientific American reported on the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in December 2020. The story looked at the possibility of \"lingering radiation effects on animal populations.\"",

Internal validation reveals a significant mismatch between the caption and the image's content. The image depicts an individual with extensive tattoos washing themselves in an onsen, but the caption provides additional information (occupation and age) that is not visually verifiable.  External validation, while suggesting the plausibility of the name and age, cannot definitively confirm the existence of a construction worker named Hiraku Sasaki.  The absence of corroborating information from reliable sources renders the caption's accuracy highly uncertain. Visual evidence only shows a tattooed individual in an onsen; no clues about their identity or profession are present. There's no visual tampering or miscontextualization apparent.  The lack of visual cues relating to the claimed profession and the absence of external verifiable evidence combine to produce a very low confidence score. The discrepancy between the internal check, which strongly suggests the caption is out of context, and the external check, which acknowledges the plausibility but not the confirmation of the details, contributes to the low confidence score.

The image clearly shows a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton undergoing cleaning in what appears to be a museum setting.  The caption accurately identifies the dinosaur type and the activity depicted.

However, it notes a lack of definitive proof confirming that this specific cleaning event occurred at that museum, assigning a confidence score of 8.\n\nWhile the external check expresses some uncertainty due to the lack of concrete evidence about this particular event, this does not invalidate the caption. The internal check's high confidence score coupled with the plausibility of the described event (museum cleaning a dinosaur replica) makes the caption likely accurate.\n\nThe slight discrepancy in confidence scores between the internal (10) and external (8) checks can be attributed to the difference between direct visual evidence (internal check) and the need for external verification of a specific event (external check). The external check correctly points out the lack of specific news articles or museum records confirming the event shown in the image.\n\nConsidering the visual evidence, the plausible context, and the corroborating external information, the claim in the caption is highly likely accurate. The confidence score of 9 reflects the combination of strong internal validation and the plausible external context, while acknowledging the lack of definitive external proof regarding the precise event's documentation.\n\nThere's no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image itself is consistent with the caption's description.

            "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

This significant discrepancy between internal and external validation necessitates a conclusion of \"out of context.\" The internal check relies solely on visual and textual analysis within the meme, failing to account for external realities. The high confidence scores for both checks reflect the certainty of their respective findings, although they point in opposite directions. The resolution of this conflict prioritizes the externally verified facts over the internal visual analysis because external sources provide demonstrably more trustworthy information. The meme uses a real image of Ricci Ellsworth and manipulates it to create a false narrative.  Therefore, the caption is out of context due to the verifiable inaccuracy of the meme's claims.

            "content": "When the World Went Away, We Made a New One I lost many things during the quarantine. But there can be an unexpected abundance inside a state of loss.\nLike so many quarantines, mine began with a series of sudden subtractions: subways, classes, public spaces, hugs, bookstores, child care; the bodies of friends in my living room; the bodies of strangers brushing against mine on the sidewalk; and finally my own body, as the virus came for me early, insistent but ultimately merciful; shivers and night sweats and muscle aches rippling from my neck to my heels. During those weeks of total isolation with my toddler, I lost my sense of taste and smell, lost everything beyond my doorway  lost the streets of my city, which was rapidly flooding with deeper losses I could only imagine. The wailing sirens made it impossible to forget that the hospitals were filling with patients on ventilators.\nThe subtractions of our quarantine came on the heels of other ones. I signed divorce papers just a month before the city started shutting down, and as the lockdowns restrictions drew an increasingly tight perimeter around every household, they cast into sharper relief the ways mine had been gutted. It felt vaguely like being forced to live in a building splintered by a wrecking ball before the rebuilding had begun. Quarantine didnt just take things away; it revealed  with a harsh, unrelenting clarity  what had already been lost.\nOnce I realized I would be spending many weeks alone at home with my daughter, I made us a daily schedule with clumsy illustrations: stray water drops next to Mama Shower, a cutout octopus next to Cleaning/Chores, as if wed deploy eight arms to wipe the door handles with bleach; a tiger beside our Morning Walk, as if the streets of Brooklyn would be full of exotic discoveries. But once I got sick, even the limited life outlined on our rainbow schedule  its cheerful colors radiating compensatory, forced optimism  now seemed nave in its aspirations, anchored by walks we could no longer take, meals I could no longer taste and activities that required staying vertical longer than I could manage. The cherry blossoms beyond our windows seemed tone-deaf in their extravagance. The sunshine arrived like someone laughing on a hospital ward.\nBefore I realized I was sick, I refused to believe my own fatigue, falling asleep on the couch while I tried to return work email during naptime. But eventually there was no denying it: the aches running like electric currents through my legs, wearing me out like exercise. When I stood after picking up things my daughter dropped or tossed, the corners of my vision fluttered with dark flecks. The virus claimed my bedroom as its own, salting my sheets with night sweat. When I woke in the darkness, body aching in the gloom, I always checked the news on my phone before I could remember not to.\nA few days after I lost my sense of taste and smell, I started seeing articles about this new symptom. Thats how it was: bodies in the news, and the news in our bodies, making us sweat and shiver. It seemed as if losing my sense of taste was a personalized cosmic joke, a nod to the eating disorder I had years earlier. But thats the fallacy and hubris of any misfortune, however minor  that it was made bespoke, just for us. I knew this was melodrama and tried not to indulge it before naptime. Then I could cry alone in the bathroom if I needed to.\nMaybe the pandemic felt to everyone like a heat-seeking missile specifically targeting the particular fragilities of any life  a new business, a restaurant job, a fractured marriage or its dissolution  even as the virus cast its vast, impersonal damage across us all. It created a certain cognitive dissonance to encounter something as surreal and unfamiliar as a global pandemic from inside the deadening familiarity and cloistered banality of our apartment  an extraordinary event experienced from inside a parade of days textured by unceasing ordinariness, the daily loop of domesticity. The teakettle, the oatmeal-crusted bowls in the sink, the toddler scattering her tiny hats and gloves across the floor for the umpteenth time, Mama FIX it. The days were endless and also irrelevant: Tuesdays were Wednesdays were Fridays, except sometimes it was raining outside and sometimes it was sunny and sometimes  as a neighbor informed us by text  someone broke into the vestibule of our building to ransack the Amazon packages. The past flooded the empty present, filling the apartment with its ghosts.\nI kept remembering the summer I spent recovering from jaw surgery two decades earlier, not just sequestered in my home but in my body; unable to eat or speak because my jaw was wired shut for months, 18 years old and missing the world that was stripped away. I kept remembering the first time I tried to stop drinking  at 27, a decade later  when I essentially put myself in quarantine, taking a week off my bakery job to hole up in my brothers empty apartment and Not Drink. In my mind, this self-sequestering was a cross between a bad schoolgirls being sent to a corner of the classroom and a heros striding off to some remote mountaintop to confront her archenemy in one-on-one combat. In reality, it mainly involved eating saltines and foil-wrapped triangles of spreadable cheese for dinner, and realizing  at one point  that it had been a couple of days since Id been outside, in part because I was afraid I lacked the willpower not to stop at a liquor store. I drank again as soon as I got home.\nWhen I tried to quit again, a few months later, it was not in isolation but by flinging myself into the unexpected community of recovery meetings. Remembering those nights in the midst of the pandemic, I yearned for their physicality: the unfolded origami creases of strangers papery palms against my own; the stem of a plastic fork still warm from someone elses grip as I pronged a vanilla-frosted slice of sober-anniversary cake; the raspy voices and minty gum-breath of chain-smokers offering collective prayers. But after six weeks of studiously avoiding any kind of contact or even proximity with strangers, I also flinched at the idea of that kind of bodily communion; it seemed an impossibly beautiful constellation of perilous exposures.\nBut while the physical proximity of early sobriety felt impossibly far away, an echo from those days felt eerily close  the surprise of finding unexpected abundance inside a state of loss. When you lose what you rely upon, you start reaching for things you never thought youd want, or else the things you already had but always took for granted. Early sobriety taught me one version of this strange arithmetic by giving me a way to understand what I was losing  the sweet oblivion of getting drunk  in terms of what it made room for: not just the sweaty palms and earnest confessions of strangers but also a more acute presence in my own life.\nAt first, of course, not-drinking was hell. It was deprivation and punishment, as if I were trapped in a bare white room while the cinema reels of boozy nostalgia played on the other side of a glass wall: the salty pop of gin-soaked olives, the foam of cold beer on warm summer evenings flickering with fireflies. All that was gone. Only seltzer remained. But if not-drinking was hell, then sobriety was something else. Eventually  not on the first day, or the 20th, but maybe on the 100th, or the 400th  the whole world began to open up. Days werent just defined by absence  this is life minus drinking  but by a new kind of plenitude: the rituals of recovery meetings, and the voices of strangers in those rooms, telling stories about loving booze so much they thought their hearts would break from losing it.\nThis strange, unsettling affinity with strangers was abundance. The call to listen was abundance. But these werent the only forms of abundance. The sensory hyperattention of sobriety was overwhelming, like staring at the sun: the acid pang of an orange slice on a cold sore, the ache in the balls of my feet after 12 hours standing beside a giant mixer in the kitchen of the bakery where I worked. The abundance of those days rose from the conspiracy of multiple constraints  the constraints of sobriety alongside the confines of that cramped kitchen and those repetitive labors. Even unbeautiful things came to constitute a strange new lushness, because they felt so ferociously proximate, so searing and undeniable.\nA decade later, quarantine was nothing if not searing and undeniable  the broken-record quality of our daily lives insisting on the same rooms, the same people, the same routines. Recovery meetings happened on Zoom now, like so much of the rest of my life, and at a distance couldnt offer the same bodily surrender. Still, while certain kinds of visceral intimacy were lost, in other ways the meetings felt more intimate than ever. Every square on the screen was a portal into someones home, revealing other sober alcoholics leaning against their headboards or curled up under blankets, Bluetooth buds carrying the rest of our voices, cat whiskers swishing suddenly in front of computer cameras. In our thumbnail boxes, we chanted the serenity prayer in an out-of-sync patchwork that was somehow more moving for its raggedness, for the ways it failed to disguise the incompleteness of our medium, the ways it didnt replace what wed lost: that room full of body heat and layer cake, plastic forks passed palm to palm. It was a chorus of disembodied voices trying our best, straining or fumbling or sometimes surging toward gratitude; acknowledging all the loss and terror around us without trying to redeem it.\nFor the first few meetings I attended, I had Zoom set to speaker mode because I didnt know there was a gallery alternative that could display everyones faces at once. Whoever was speaking loomed large, but whenever someone laughed or murmured in recognition their face would pop briefly to the center of the screen  the technology illuminating, just for a moment, the flashes of resonance that had animated our meetings all along. Sometimes Id be distracted or horrified by the sight of my own face in the corner  wondering if my expression communicated enough attention, compassion or openhearted presence  but one of the best things about speaker mode was that it let me scroll away from my own face so I didnt see it at all. Scrolling away from my own face on Zoom became a technological embodiment of what recovery meetings had been inviting me to do for years: get away from myself, flee the quarantine of my own heart.\nEven outside these meetings, quarantine was enacting a daily alchemy with the abstract truisms of recovery, making them concrete: One day at a time meant not knowing how long quarantine would last. It meant: Just get through this single stretch of hours. Surrender existed on all scales. It meant giving up on knowing how the pandemic would play out across the world. It meant giving up a definite timeline for when wed come out of lockdown. It meant letting my daughter pull all the books off the bookshelf without trying to pick them up. One morning I sat cross-legged and tried to read passages from a book of Buddhist meditations  holding on to anything blocks wisdom, I dutifully repeated  while my daughter climbed onto my back, heaving oatmeal breath on my cheek, and pulled the book from my hands. She enacted its truth by ripping one of its pages.\nTen days into our total isolation, once our apartment had filled with bags of recycling, I Googled toddler art + old trash. We ended up drawing a road on the back of a cardboard diaper box. When she ripped up one of her picture books, we used the illustrations as decoration, and I copied a quote onto the cardboard from a poem Sylvia Plath had written for her newborn son, a poem I memorized at 24 during the months after my abortion: Love, love, I have hung our cave with roses. . . .  Old trash was the new cross-stitch. My daughter scribbled over the lines with marker, and they felt even truer obscured by her scribbles, spackled with her fish stickers.\nEvery morning I read the same passage in the Big Book, It is plain that a life which includes deep resentment leads only to futility and unhappiness, and thought of other peoples quarantines  people with partners, who curled up with a body each night, or people whod fled the city, or people whod fled the city with their partners  and tried to surrender that resentment too. I tried to neutralize it with gratitude. Not gratitude in the dutiful, box-checking, white-knuckled sense of acknowledging everything I had  my health, my daughter, my job  but in a more immediate sense: for the sunlight on my daughters overgrown curls, for the specific weight of her head on my shoulder; for my students reading from the pandemic diaries Id asked them to keep, as we all gathered in our Zoom boxes to listen; for my high school friends on Zoom, how blunt and broken I could be in their company. I was grateful for the taste of peanut butter, the first time it returned  the first time any taste returned. The faint nutty sweetness was like a stranger standing at the end of a long corridor, barely visible but there  more than six feet away, but better than no one at all.\nDuring the thickest, shivery days of my illness  when it was just me and my daughter and a photo-copy of my divorce settlement on a closet shelf, tucked beneath our stash of cloth masks  it was as if her tiny, restless body were living for both of us: tasting for us both, seeking pleasure for us both, radiating energy for us both. She conducted intense, inscrutable projects, using her tiny wok to carry my lucky hawks feather  found by the side of the road on a sunny day upstate, in another universe entirely  to her little wooden kitchen, where she stirred it with a little wooden knife. What was she doing? Her eyes gleamed with focus. She wanted to take care of everything. She tried to put a diaper on her wooden zebra. She tried to put a diaper on our Dustbuster. She tried to put a diaper on our tube of Clorox wipes and then tuck it under my comforter. Night, night, she said. On Day 8 of our isolation, she glanced toward the window and said plaintively, Outside. On Day 9, we spotted a toddler in a puffy orange coat lurching toward her father on a driveway across the street, and my daughter called out: Orange baby! Seeing another person felt like spotting a celebrity. When the toddler left, my daughter called out: Orange baby come back!\nWhen my aching muscles felt like knotted ropes draped across the inside of my body, and I felt incapable of doing much besides lying down, I was grateful for my daughters endless appetite for stories. Her desire to read 20 picture books in a row no longer seemed burdensome, as it did during the busy crush of normal life; now it seemed more like a way she was guiding us through the hours. The days were a swirl of body chills and fantasies: the story about the boy and bear traveling through a magical land of berries; the story about the mouse who recited poems to all the other mice spending winter huddled in an old stone wall; the story about the woman who gazed out the window from her sick bed and imagined planting lupines across the hills; the story about the dinosaur who wanted to be a ballerina. It started to seem as if every story were about quarantine. The mice in the old stone wall were in quarantine. The woman in her sickbed was in quarantine. The brontosaurus bumping her head while attempting a jet was in her own quarantine  trapped in a space that was too confined, a world that was too small. The boy and the bear on the blackberry train were clearly also in quarantine; thats why they were dreaming of this fantastical land full of strawberry ponies and raspberry fireworks.\nAt dusk each day, I played Leonard Cohen during bath-time, his scratchy voice crooning about a Manhattan that no longer existed, and might never exist again, where theres music on Clinton Street all through the evening. My daughters tiny palms splashed against the soapy water as the streets below our window erupted into applause for the doctors and nurses at the hospital a few blocks away  and we clapped too, through the suds of her bath, though no one could hear us.\nI tried to feed my daughter at least one new thing each day, as a way of telling the days apart. Boiled zucchini, sliced rings of pineapple, raspberries before they fuzzed with tiny white beards of mold. Pasta shaped like bow ties, pasta shaped like wagon wheels. Peanut butter straight from the jar. Sometimes I caught myself gazing at her with jealousy  she could still taste. I missed the taste of chocolate, the taste of apples, the taste of Cheddar cheese, even the taste of the instant coffee I drank when the good coffee ran out. Or certain smells, like the urine tang and compost stink of my daughters drooping diapers  I grew to miss even that.\nMissing taste became a way of missing everything. I missed the air, missed having moments when I was doing something other than picking tiny wooden teacups off the floor, missed other people  even a single other person, even the bodies of strangers  missed my friend Anna, who lived five blocks away, now a thousand miles, who brought over groceries when I was sick: a bulb of fennel and a carton of mushrooms and pale balls of raw cookie dough, grub worms of knobby turmeric (what do I . . . ?). Late at night, after our kids were asleep, Anna and I would trade voice memos telling the stories of objects in our homes, because the objects in our homes were what we had. She told me about her stack of overdue library books, the orange earrings shed given birth in. It wasnt the same as feeling her arm draped over my shoulders, or watching our toddlers gazing up at us, side by side, waiting for us to feed them chunks of apple-cider doughnuts. But it was something that reached into my marrow, her voice traveling across the city blocks, filling up the darkness.\nA few years into sobriety, I went to a potluck where no one ate or drank anything. Half of the people who came were alcoholic, or sober addicts, and the other half struggled with binge eating, so the idea was basically: What activity can we gather around that doesnt involve putting something into our bodies? Everyone brought something to read, and we gathered over flickering candles and listened to one another as if our voices were food. A few days into the quarantine, when two friends organized a group of us to read poems aloud and send the audio files to one another, I thought of that boozeless, foodless potluck, how grace never arrives as we imagine it. I sat by a window overlooking empty streets, as my daughter tried to put a wooden cookie in my mouth, and listened to the disembodied voice of my friend reading William Merediths Accidents of Birth: to/meet in a room, alive in our skins,/and the whole galaxy gaping there.\nWhat to do with the strange incandescence of those two weeks of total isolation with my daughter  her sweet voice naming all the animals in her bath book as the clapping from the streets rose around us like a hymn? What to do with the eerie, spellbinding video my friend sent of herself dancing in the middle of a deserted street to a speaker blaring We Are the World from a shuttered jewelry store? These strange beauties did nothing to supply the ventilators our city lacked, to mitigate the oncoming apex of deaths, to stave off the bankruptcies or the oncoming recession. They were not a vaccine, or an antibody test, or even a useless floating hospital docked in the Hudson River. They did not cure the virus, or redeem the suffering it caused. The sirens kept blaring as I gave my daughter her baths.\nIts easy to subscribe to a fantasy of diminishment as revelation  the notion that wisdom is the inevitable yield of hardship. But sometimes loss just feels like loss, and absence is just absence: the solipsism of pain; the ache of losing touch; the empty streets and bankruptcies, the missing ventilators, the bodies stored in the temporary morgues of moving vans. The trick is how to hold both truths at once  absence-as-presence and absence-as-absence  rather than letting one obscure the other; how to let fragile, unexpected, imperfect consolations exist alongside everything they cant console.\nHolding both at once lets us honor the pleasures and odd discoveries of quarantine without blinding ourselves to everything beyond it. Its a way of seeing that does not back away from what is happening by pretending people are not dying, and that does not back away from what is happening by pretending people are not loving and being loved alongside this death. Because we are also eating brownies. We are stupefied by the tenderness of a child tucking a tube of Clorox wipes under the covers. We are brought to tears by the sight of a nurse walking home from work in hospital scrubs. Suffering and grace live side by side, as they always have  in the same homes, or else separated by those walls we keep between our bodies now, in service of a solidarity we trust but cannot touch. Grace locks eyes with pain from the other side of the sidewalk, six feet away, and they both keep walking.\nLeslie Jamison is the author, most recently, of Make It Scream, Make It Burn.

His book Death Wins a Goldfish was published last year.\nInsanity Can Keep You Sane If you cant live normally, why not find little harebrained ways to warp reality?\nMy quarantine has been fine. I was able to get out of the city; I dont have the virus; Ive lost some work, but not all of it; and just under 17 percent of my immediate family members have fallen seriously ill. Ive made out beautifully, and I feel terribly unhappy: a pair of conditions that are tough to either reconcile or deny. Like characters in an Edgar Allan Poe story, every person I know is suddenly confined to a small space and forced to meditate on existence, death and his or her own satanic impulses. The physical manifestations of my own dread have included insomnia, a bumper crop of gray hairs and an absence of self-control around any form of alcohol or drug. At some point my ribs became countable. I daydream about which elected officials most deserve to get Covid. Being an inessential worker in every sense of the word, there has been no obvious way for me to channel my bad feelings into civically productive activities. If I cant be productive, I have three choices: Do nothing, do destructive things or do neutral things.\nThe adaptations began during my third week of quarantine. Over the course of a routine internet stroll, I discovered a natural lifestyle coach named Tony Riddle. Riddle looks like a Viking warlord and does stuff like try to run 900 miles across the entire length of Britain barefoot. He has sinuous muscles and four children and does not believe in normal furniture, especially chairs, which he considers unnatural and expendable. His home contains none. Instead, he recommends ground living: banishing furniture in favor of endless variations on squatting and kneeling. This, according to him, helps nourish a persons ankles, knees and hips, as well as rewilding her feet. I watched a hypnotic two-minute video of Riddle, serene and barefoot, as he moved through 10 positions designed to help support my ancestral movement system. Was he a maniac? A genius? Only one way to find out.\nI spent a day working from the floor, squatting before and around my computer as though it were a campfire, with glutes aflame and feet unshod. This is how a monkey sees the world, I thought, dreamily. It was the calmest Id felt in days. If lacking something as fundamental as furniture did not impair my life, perhaps the same could be true of recently banned fundamentals, like social contact or walking outdoors without a muzzle. When people talk about fasting, this is what they talk about: the surge of power that arises from realizing you dont need what you thought you did.\nAnd so other behavior modifications followed, all of them minor acts of norm-shedding. I wandered around naked and stayed up all night. I paced thousands of laps around the kitchen table. I slept in places that were not my bed. I ate a meal without using my hands or any utensils, like a dog, just to see what it was like. (Sloppy, as I expected.) I coaxed a group of wild turkeys out of the woods with a trail of sunflower seeds that I placed in a circle, which they obediently traced. I tried to attract other birds by sitting quietly on the porch cloaked in seeds but had to go back inside after being menaced by a squirrel.\nNone of these hobbies were fascinating or impressive  and theyre even less so when I type them out  but they were placating, free and legal. I couldnt stop finding harebrained new ways to warp reality. Little by little, my fidelity to personhood diminished. I spent hours sitting on the carpet against a wall, doing nothing except considering. I considered investigating the stain under the boiler. I considered making banana bread. I considered cleaning the gutters. The word consider implies, correctly, that these thoughts at no point turned into actions. During one morning of considering I felt my head entering the wall, or sort of dipping in and out of it. This went on for a minute before the sensation faded and was replaced with a moment of alarm at the banality of the hallucination, which was like being on the worlds lamest drug: Instead of experiencing ego death, I momentarily penetrated a sheet of drywall. What was the life-altering lesson in that? Sleep more, maybe.\nSome years ago a friend of mine lived with a community called the Bruderhof. The Bruderhof is a constellation of settlements numbering about 3,000 people, spread over four continents, with roots in Anabaptism  a 16th-century radical offshoot of Protestantism that believes in a separation of church and state and adult baptism, among other reforms. Members are pacifists who renounce private property, live simply, dress modestly and  to judge by the official Bruderhof website  have a distinctive sense of humor. (Among the questions in the sites FAQ section: Sorry, whats Anabaptism? and Do you ever have fun at the Bruderhof?) Amish-adjacent is probably the easiest way to describe them, but theyre allowed to have smartphones, drive cars and upload (utterly delightful!) YouTube videos.\nAt some point in my friends residence, a pregnant couple from the community went to an outside hospital to give birth. The baby was stillborn. Instead of the planned celebration, a course of mourning began. The day after the couple returned, a busload of men and women from a neighboring settlement showed up to take over daily operations. For 10 days this fleet of visitors cooked, cleaned and performed whatever tasks needed doing while the home community paused. It felt like something from Lord of the Rings,  my friend told me. All of a sudden this ancillary battalion shows up over the hill, and you feel like you might win the battle. I cant claim to understand the exact meaning of this protocol, but it makes sense on its face. A grieving period is marked by altering outer reality to mimic the state of the bereaveds inner world: absolute inertia, total cessation of routine. The ratification might not be curative, but at least it would feel cosmically sensical.\nThe philosophical underpinning of this process is something the Bruderhof calls gelassenheit, and like a lot of ultimately untranslatable German words, the meaning has been extensively discussed, debated and written about on the internet. (The Anabaptist blogging community is surprisingly robust.) Yielding, waiting, submitting to God, abandoning the self, surrendering pride, subordinating the individual to the community  this is the English word cloud around gelassenheit. One blogger described it as an antidote to the sheer pompous weariness of the world, which sounds about right.\nThere is an argument that behaving unusually is a rational way to assimilate an altered reality, especially if the alteration is a rotten one. When you pre-emptively dismiss whatever rules of living are within your control, like using furniture or wearing clothes, youre injecting yourself with a tolerable portion of insanity, which works like a vaccine. Im childless, but Ive watched friends who are isolating with children slip immediately into a less-extreme version of the same state: losing their grip, abandoning their routines, witnessing their selves mutate. If you believe that identity is behavior  that you are how you act, not what you think or how you feel  then you understand that adjectives like normal or functional require constant tending. If you change your conduct, you can change your life: how simple, and how daunting! All it took for me to become unrecognizable was to start acting like a different person. In theory, this should work in reverse too. When this is all over, I can return to chairs and forks and sleep. It would probably be for the best. In the meantime, there are plenty of individuals who havent spiraled, either because they dont have the luxury or do have a stronger constitution. In these people I find an inspiring path back to normalcy.\nNext to the house where Im staying is a road that cuts through a marsh to a bunch of dumpsters, and I spend hours shuffling between the house and the dumpsters. It would be more pleasant to walk literally anywhere else, but I need to be within sprinting distance of home in case the anxiety takes a stomach-related expression. It doesnt help that the marsh smells powerfully of sulfur. Its like a Gary Larson sketch of hell. During one of my customary shuffles between home and dumpsters I looked up and saw, on the embankment opposite the fetid marsh, a guy in work boots with his hands on his hips, gazing down at me. I lurched to a halt, embarrassed to be caught scurrying back and forth like a creepy little rodent. He lifted a hand and waved.\nIllustration by Brian Rea.\nMolly Young is a contributing writer for the magazine and the literary critic for New York magazine. Brian Rea is an artist in Los Angeles. His book Death Wins a Goldfish was published last year.\nThe Comfort of Common Creatures Watching birds is a way of mobilizing attention, to turn it into a means of imaginative escape.\nIve always hated staying still. I was the child who fidgeted, the student who couldnt concentrate, who would find any excuse to leave her desk and wander the streets, not to go shopping, or to meet friends, but simply to keep moving as a way to escape anxiety. Its a tactic that has worked for me for many years, but now, like millions of others, I have to remain within the walls of my home. This confinement is a challenge for me, one so absurdly unimportant in the face of the current crisis that Im uncomfortable even speaking of it. But its a difficulty all the same.\nRecently I fired up a very old computer, a heavy, slow beast that still has within it all the research files I was working on nearly two decades ago. I was searching for a series of photographs I took in an Oxford library. Here they are. The patterns on the underside of soaring buzzard wings drawn in pencil upon a flattened cigarette pack. Photographs, letters. A hand-drawn map of Oflag VIIB, the prisoner-of-war camp in Eichsttt, Bavaria, where the German Army held Allied officers from 1940 to 1945, and pages and pages of notebooks written by prisoners who spent their days in this camp, and others, recording the lives of birds that nested there.\nIn Britain, comparisons to the Second World War have become a refrain of the Covid-19 crisis. Myriad political commentators have praised that eras heroism, the ability of the British people to cope with discomfort and hardship. They use the war to encourage us to approach the pandemic with poise and equanimity. Such exhortations traduce the terrible realities of that war, and tend to flatten the worst aspects of this crisis too, and this is why Im hesitant to draw any parallels between the lives of young men confined in a prison camp and the minor inconveniences of lockdown. But something about the present circumstances made me remember those men and want to revisit the notes they took.\nThey wrote about arriving in the camp and deciding it was paradise for a bird-watcher. Of how they watched for hours at a time, alone or in shifts  teams of men whose attention was fixed on the goldfinches that nested within the wire fences, on redstarts and wrynecks or warblers or crows  taking exactingly detailed notes of what those birds were doing every second of their witnessed lives. One watcher, Peter Conder, who later became the director of Britains Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, eventually escaped captivity carrying his precious notes in a rucksack fashioned from an old shirt. These men told themselves that their notes would be of scientific importance once the war was over, but I dont think thats why they made their rigorous observations. I think doing so brought them comfort; the birds they watched were free and knew nothing of war, and they were the same kinds they knew from home. But mostly watching the birds was a way of mobilizing attention, to turn it into a means of imaginative escape, a way to counter their own sense of captivity, of powerlessness, futility and despair.\nOver the last weeks, Ive often seen it suggested in the press and social media that spending time in the natural world can bring comfort and consolation during the pandemic. Its a notion rich with privilege, for Covid-19 is disproportionately affecting communities with little financial capital living in urban environments, for whom access to acres of forests or fields is difficult or impossible. But as these notebooks show, there are small, local methods of regarding the natural world that are available to anyone and can lessen the psychological burden of adversity.\nDuring lockdown I have been spending a considerable amount of time watching the common birds that visit my small backyard. There are pigeons, starlings, blackbirds collecting beakfuls of dried grass to line their nests, sparrows taking dust baths in a patch of bare and sunlit earth. Watching animals from your home  and they can be anything from sparrows to spiders on windowsills  can give solace through the shift in perspective that the writer and philosopher Iris Murdoch called unselfing. In her book The Sovereignty of Good, she gave the example of how, when feeling anxious and resentful and caught up in your own concerns, you might look out of the window and see a hovering kestrel; stare at it  and then the world becomes all kestrel, just for a while. Your brooding self disappears, and when you return to yourself, your mental suffering has been lessened.\nMost of us expect our lives to have familiar trajectories and spend our days secure in our assumptions about how things will go and what will happen next. Covid-19 has many terrible effects, but one that is particularly quiet and strange is how it has unmoored us from that familiar expectation. Everything is on hold. The future is indeterminate. We do not know what will happen next. We cannot. The sparrows that hop on the bricks of my backyard wall have daily routines I am coming to know, and witnessing them is calming to watch when I have few of my own. As I look out of my window in lockdown, my attention is fixed on these birds, rather than trees or distant rooftops, because I am desperate for novelty, to watch things that alter; for in seeing change, I can parse time.\nWhile the prison-camp ornithologists took their notes, their lives were being controlled by camp administrators and guards, their futures dictated by the frighteningly unknowable progression of the war. They were crammed into close quarters, fed noisome rations, trapped in a situation in which they had no control over what would happen to them. But they could observe. I used to watch this pair of goldfinches for 10 hours a day, Peter Conder wrote, and sometimes up to 13 hours, with only a minute or two for breaks. The simple act of watching the birds could lessen the grip of dismal circumstances upon these men. But by making their careful notes, they did something more: grant themselves a new sense of control. Like his fellow bird-minded internees, Conder wrote down everything the birds did, every visit they made to the nest, every song, every flight to and from nearby trees, every hop and scratch and turn. These men were writing trajectories, borrowed from the lives of birds, that made the passing of time meaningful. Trajectories that ran backward rather than forward, but were reassuringly solid and sustained all the same.\nThe word observation comes from the Latin observatio, and its etymological history spans acts of both observation and observance. As I read these prison-camp notebooks, I began to see that what these men did was a form of devotion. They were using the small lives of birds as things they could orient themselves against. Their patient observations remind me of how monks in medieval monasteries ordered their days to fill them with meaning. How they made careful notes of the weather, of the changing pattern of the stars, and how they timed their prayers according to the precise positions of celestial objects. I never thought that I could be content to stay still, but I remember those monks, look at the notes taken by the men watching small birds behind the wire, and think, too, of Elisabeth Tova Baileys book The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating, the story of how, confined to bed for many months by a debilitating mitochondrial disease, she made careful observations of a tiny snail that had been brought in from outside in a pot of violets, transforming what she saw into a rich meditation on snails and time and habitation and purpose at a time when all other life was out of reach. What she came to understand during that time is something I have been late in learning. We dont need to strike out into the wild to feel close to the natural world and receive benison from it. From one place, we can witness the sweep and dip of the universe about us. The stars over the monastery gables, the birds on the wire, the street pigeons that visit the patch of grass behind my house before flying off elsewhere. We can become deeply connected to the world through paying the most careful and fearless attention to what we can see, from wherever it is we must be.\nIllustration by Brian Rea.\nHelen Macdonald is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of the best-selling memoir H Is for Hawk.

In the early days, we saw fast and sumptuous American cars driven by liveried chauffeurs, he writes. These were followed by the less shiny, less new vehicles of the middle classes, which were in turn followed days later by caravans of jalopies, eventually abandoned by the roadside, their owners continuing on foot to the next town, then by train, bicycle, or hitchhiking. Next came the cyclists  mostly young, often carefree  then the pedestrians, sometimes whole families, the man with a rucksack on his shoulder, the woman pushing a cart or baby carriage. Later came the stragglers, overwhelmed, feet bloodied. Finally, there were the horse-drawn carriages driven by peasants, laden with sick people, children, old people, agricultural equipment and furniture, he writes. Sometimes livestock walked alongside them, including cows and horses.\nPlus a change. It wasnt nearly so frenetic, but on March 16 my wife and I, along with our two small children and whatever clothes, books and toys we could think to grab, ordered a taxi across an empty Paris and joined a crush of masked travelers at the Gare Montparnasse. As we idled under the LCD screens, waiting anxiously for the arrival of the trains that would shoot out of the station to various destinations along the countrys western reaches, I was aware that we were all of us re-enacting a scene that has played out over and over again throughout this citys dramatic history.\nThe day we left, after a week of growing alarm over the spread of the novel coronavirus and decreasing freedom in the attempt to limit the contagion, starting with the closure of schools and swiftly followed by the shuttering of all nonessential businesses, President Emmanuel Macron was scheduled to address the nation in the evening. He would, as many expected, soon order total home confinement. The only question for anyone with options was where to go to endure it. We barely had a chance to contemplate our decision.\nThe day before we ended up leaving, it was our stroke of good fortune to be having lunch with a couple who have their own young children and an acquaintance in government kind enough to give them advance warning. These friends patiently impressed upon us the severity of what was about to happen. We were going to be housebound for the next 15 days, very likely longer. Our friends would be leaving in a few hours for their family home near the Atlantic. Would we like to hunker down with them? At least this way the kids would have a yard to expand into. Once the order was made official, it would be much more difficult to move around the country. I grabbed my friends laptop and reserved what appeared to be four of the last tickets available to La Baule-Escoublac before confinement, departing the following morning.\nOur decision was a common one. Le Parisien reported that more than a million residents left the Paris region before confinement, based on geolocation data collected by Orange, the countrys largest mobile-phone service provider. The companys chief executive estimated that from March 13 to March 20, a staggering 17 percent of the population of Paris and its neighboring suburbs decamped to their country houses, of which there exist some 3.4 million around the nation.\nContemplating these figures and their implications, I was reminded of the architectural historian James S. Ackermans 1990 classic, The Villa: Form and Ideology of Country Houses, and its famous description of the significance of the secondary residence in an urbanized society. Noting that the basic program of the villa has remained unchanged since Roman times, Ackerman offers an explanation: It fills a need that never alters, a need which, because it is not material but psychological and ideological, is not subject to the influences of evolving societies and technologies. The villa accommodates a fantasy which is impervious to reality. And though it exists as a respite from the city, the villa cannot be understood apart from the city  its meaning derives from what it is not.\nFew, if any, European societies are as centralized as France. Almost a full fifth of the French population lives in the Paris metropolitan area. In terms of cultural and economic dominance, Paris, still Europes fashion capital, also combines the functions and prestige of Wall Street, Hollywood and Washington  all in one location. Despite various attempts over the years to decentralize the state, the inhabitants of the city lord over the rest of France to an extent that is similar but distinct from the divide between real America and its coastal elite. Despite extravagantly rich and diverse geographical blessings, from snow-capped Alpine slopes to crystalline Mediterranean shores and the exquisite soils of Champagne and Bordeaux, since monarchical times, the country has principally understood itself along a simple binary: Paris/province. Recently, such cultural and political insolubility has provoked serious societal consequences. First came more than a solid year of Yellow Vest protests and riots, which, in Paris, sometimes had the feel of a furious guerrilla war being waged on the town by the country. Now we have Covid-19, and though France provides a safety net that precludes the spectacular kind of degradation and suffering currently on display in America, few seem to believe that were truly all in this together.\nOn top of it all  or as a fundamental aspect of this imbalanced relationship  there is that unusually high proportion of second-home ownership (even if its worth noting that these homes, while lovely, are typically modest). In times of crisis, whether man-made or the result of the pestilent flail of God, as Camus so memorably phrased it, Parisians who can are wont to chase their safety to the provinces. Fleeing Paris is a collective, inherited reflex. And as Mends-Frances account lays bare, whatever else they are, such stories of escape are always accounts of privilege  with regard to the position of the capital in relation to the rest of the country, as well as the internal hierarchy of its inhabitants.\nAs a parisien dadoption, I am only semicognizant of where I may fit at any given time into the French social fabric. As a foreigner compelled by an epidemic to abandon my home  an exile twice over  it is difficult, if necessary, for me to think of myself as part of this other, overarching dynamic. Traveling through France in regular times, for better or worse, I am simply perceived as an American. But now its different. My family has inadvertently participated in a larger, possibly exploitative interaction that has sown resentment among some residents of the rural areas we have infiltrated. The locals weve met have been mostly welcoming and generous, though its hard to say to what degree thats because the fear that Parisians would spread the virus ultimately proved unfounded. In those infrequent but memorable instances in which a neighbor declines a bonjour, and for the first time I can remember, I think I do detect my wife and friends being perceived the way that I can be viewed  not as natives but as interlopers in this land.\nLa Baule-Escoublac, the nearby seaside resort we had come through from Paris, counted 10 refugees for every inhabitant during the last mass exodus 80 years ago. As fearsome as Covid-19 is, it is not the Nazis. Still, the mayor of La Baule, Yves Mtaireau, estimated that the population had swelled to more than 40,000 inhabitants from 17,000. After nearly a decade of expatriate ambivalence, imagining myself not so much a resident of France as a trans-Atlantic commuter, to use James Baldwins phrase  with one foot in this society and one foot out  in exercising this authentically Parisian need to escape, it feels as though, suddenly, Ive had my position here solidified. Mandatory confinement is scheduled to expire on May 11, but neither my wife nor I is so inclined to return to the city right away. We take turns scouring the internet for houses in the country to rent  a thoroughly Parisian activity these days. The pandemic is forcing more and more of us to reconsider just where we belong.\nOn a recent afternoon, as my friend and I were waiting a safe distance behind the next person in line to enter the new organic market and scrolling through work emails, he looked up suddenly and remarked that this time away had put a few things in perspective: Maybe it wasnt all that necessary to live in Paris after all. Wed already laughed at the fact that wed gotten in the habit of spotting and mentally separating ourselves from the conspicuous new arrivals who flooded the area over the Easter break. A monthlong string of sun-drenched days was still going strong, and at that moment, I tended to agree with him. I wondered how many of the million-plus Parisians scattered around the country were thinking the same thing.\nCorrection: May 21, 2020\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the date of Pierre Mends France's book Libert, libert chrie.

She had never known the place to be so quiet nor the birdsong outside so loud. The blinds and shutters were down, she wrote. The pictures hung on the walls in heavy silence. But what unsettled her most was how the new atmosphere seemed to alter her relationship to the pictures. On this oddest of days, she said, I was drawn to a picture that has never interested me greatly. I know Gainsboroughs portrait of his two daughters chasing a butterfly means a lot to many people, but it hasnt done much for me in the past. It has always seemed schmaltzy and sentimental. But now I was utterly compelled by it.\nThomas Gainsboroughs The Painters Daughters Chasing a Butterfly, from about 1756, is a popular picture, one of those that are easy to dismiss. I began to think, Caroline wrote, that our past life has maybe been as futile as chasing butterflies. I also felt, in a weird way, that Gainsboroughs children were trapped, stuck within a frame on the wall of the gallery, and only our gaze could set them free. What Im trying to say, I guess, is that pictures only function when there are people to look at them. Otherwise, they hang somewhere in limbo, purposeless and a little lost.\nLike Caroline, I had never paid much attention to The Painters Daughters. I have many times passed it by on my way to another picture. I looked it up online. There is a strange and wary confidence to the sisters. The butterfly is precarious, pushed close to the edge of the painting, and seems to be both free and in mortal danger. The sisters are holding hands but are far apart enough that they seem connected yet distinct. It is not clear if the older one is readying herself to strike. In any event, she knows more than the other and is, at the moment we catch them, willing to let her younger sister test the limits a little. Theirs is the murderous curiosity of the innocent. The butterfly is balanced on what looks like a thorny stalk. The little sisters hand is already extended halfway there. Her delicate fingers are dark with intent. If she misses, though, the thorns will be what she catches. Her face is ignorant of this. The older sister, however, has an inkling and seems to be both encouraging and restraining her sister. Part of her purpose seems to be her own amusement. And suddenly, looking at them together  the shapes of their figures, the activity of their dresses  they resemble the wings of a large butterfly in motion. All around them is darkness. The trees are pregnant with dark premonitions, and the small light in the distant sky is weak and dying.\nNational Gallery, London/ Art Resource, NY\nIt is a painting about the turning of time, about youth and aging, about the violence of the innocent and about a fathers concern, his fears of mysterious and real dangers.\nWilli Ruge/Ullstein Bild, via Getty Images\nIn the days after my exchange with Caroline, further restrictions were imposed. I began to miss my old routine. For a majority of my life, I have visited the museum about once a week to stand in front of a picture for half an hour or so. In London, where I live for most of the year, I usually go to the National Gallery; in New York, where I live for the rest of the time, it is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Without knowing it, I have, in modest ways, come to organize my week around this habit. But this, of course, was the least of it; the coronavirus has so quickly succeeded in affecting almost every aspect of life. It has encouraged us to be suspicious of one another. It has exposed the inequities in our society. Its effects are mental as well as physical, in the sense that it threatens to attack that most essential of human rights, breathing, and compel our culture to think that the pandemic is the only thing worth thinking about. As you would under a dictatorship, you must protect your body as well as your imagination from it. I declined invitations to write about it and tried instead to focus on my work. I felt I was turning upon myself. Time itself has come to resemble a loop.\nYet somehow, whenever I longed for a return to normality, to take the bus and visit the National Gallery, the most vivid image I had wasnt from my memory. Instead, I saw myself in Carolines shoes, walking through the empty museum to look at the Gainsborough. It was as though, through a strange mental confluence, no doubt exaggerated by the situation we are all in, I had swapped places with Caroline. I thought of something she and I discussed before, in the days when we were able to meet in person, about how a painting is never finished, that it must continue to do its work long after it has been hung on the gallery wall, that a picture relies on us to complete it. This is why, we agreed passionately, free access to museums is essential. Our culture depends on it, but also the art depends on it. Now that this age-old communication was not possible, how can those paintings in the museum, hanging in the dark, function? The question presented itself with the nuts and bolts of a practical problem. When the art in the museum is inaccessible, what happens to it and what happens to us? Have we not observed how a picture can suddenly become significant to our culture while another, equally good, perhaps even better, recedes from our attention? And does this not prove that art is in constant dialogue with history?\nIt was in this state of mournful confusion that a set of photographs I saw years ago  and for all intents and purposes had forgotten about  emerged, like a found object, in my memory. In certain moments, usually when I wasnt thinking, the images would occur to me. They are by a little-known German photographer named Willi Ruge (1892-1961). I Photograph Myself During a Parachute Jump is a series shot as Ruge dived off an aircraft headfirst, like a rocket to the ground. The pictures were taken in 1931, between the two mammoth wars, and therefore a time, I imagine, like those trees in Gainsboroughs painting, pregnant with dark premonitions.\nRuge was interested in speed. As a boy he wanted to be a pilot. He sharpened his photographic skills during World War I, when he served at the front and as an air gunner. It was then that the connection was reinforced in his mind between photography and danger. He later traveled to Argentina, where he photographed bodies mingled in tango and took several disturbing shots as he turned around the muscular tug and pull of a wild horse some gauchos had chained to a tree under the blazing midday sun in order to tame it. He took aerial views of trees, each standing beside its shadow, sparsely dotting a small village in Sudan. He captured, in startlingly perfect focus, a rider falling off his horse at a steeplechase race in 1920s England. He took a haunting portrait of a Royal Air Force pilot, Lt. Col. Frederick F. Minchin, a few months before he set off on an attempt to cross the Atlantic. The aircraft disappeared. The pilots fate remains a mystery. The photograph is uncanny because Minchin appears to be mesmerized, peering fixedly at something just out of reach, as though recognizing his destiny and yet unable to escape it. Ruge caught a similar entranced quality in Rudolf Caracciola, the top racing driver of the age. He captured speed-distorted images of him whizzing by in his car and took quieter photographs of his wife as she leaned over, watching her husband with trembling pride and fear in her face.\nIn 1936, well into the Nazi years, Ruge published a series he titled In the Air With Our Combat Pilots, which included photographs that lionized the German Air Force. A few years later, during World War II, he more nakedly used his camera as a tool for propaganda: He photographed military personnel in strategic meetings, captured machine gunners and pilots in action and documented the optimistic faces of young recruits. Ruge seemed to have accepted Nazi rule and certainly supported it with his work. He, like other German photographers then, commercially benefited from the exile, incarceration and murder of able colleagues. And therefore, his work after 1933 exists in a troubling vacuum, one marked by the enforced disappearance of others, and his work before that time is touched by a powerful foreboding, as though he sensed the nearness of the precipice and was darkly drawn to it.\nOne such example is I Photograph Myself During a Parachute Jump. Here Ruge becomes the protagonist of his own work. He wanted to capture the drama from several angles. He, the falling figure, had a camera; a colleague of his photographed from another aircraft that hovered at a similar altitude; and a second was on the ground and caught, as Ruge had done with the Caracciolas, Mrs. Ruges reaction as she watched her husband descend from the sky. In Photo of Myself at the Moment of My Jump, Ruge appears to be falling backward, his mouth wind-swollen and horribly open. In I Decided to Jump Headfirst, taken from the other aircraft, we see Ruge from a distance. He is upside down, and his arms and legs are spread wide as he swims in the air a few meters beneath his aircraft, the faraway earth flat and placid beneath. Then in Meanwhile, on the Ground   we see his wife holding their newborn son and looking up at the sky, surrounded by other amazed onlookers; one of them, a lady in an open coat, is literally biting her fingers. A few seconds later, the panic has set in for Ruge. He takes a picture that he later calls With My Head Hanging Down Before the Parachute Opened  . It shows his face from beneath, his features distorted by fear and effort, and his right hand is reaching to clinch on to something. The gesture is uncannily reminiscent of Gainsboroughs younger daughters hand reaching for the butterfly.\nIn the same year that Ruge dived off the aircraft with a camera, Virginia Woolf wrote, in A Letter to a Young Poet: But it is October 1931, and for a long time now poetry has shirked contact with  what shall we call it?  Shall we shortly and no doubt inaccurately call it life? And will you come to my help by guessing what I mean? It is a curious coincidence that just as Ruge was making I Photograph Myself During a Parachute Jump, which is, in part at least, about contact and lack of contact, Woolf was thinking of the same problem in language and, more specific, poetrys ability to capture life in the modern age. And will you come to my help by guessing what I mean? is surely every work of arts silent plea. Indeed, Ruges parachuting self does remind me of the poet that Woolf evokes in her Letter, dancing on the floor of [his] mind. Here are his feet, in lace-up leather shoes, dangling helplessly above a cityscape. The architecture, trees and road below seem like a distant dream, a childs fantasy of what a city might look like. Like the rest of the photographs in this series, it is about proximity, but also approximation: how to measure the distance between two points, and what it is to cross it. They are about being suspended, and what that state might hold. They reveal a playful but also anxious response to our relationship to earth, our resistance to nature and the fantasy, which is also a madness, of wanting to be weaned from it.\nI am still surprised that the work of Willi Ruge, which has never before seriously occupied my attention, should suddenly come so vividly to mind during these strange and uncertain days. Not only are we uncertain about how and when we will come out of this; we are also unsure about the world we will find on the other side. We feel oddly convinced that nothing will be the same. It is as if the present has woken us up from a dream. And yet, very much like the painters daughters and the falling Ruge, we feel that we are involved in some sort of experiment in living. The moment is charged with opposing temptations. Will we rethink our attitudes to nature and to commerce in order to address the health of our planet and the violent inequities in our society? Will we remember the compelling force with which we have been reminded of how deeply interconnected and reliant we are on one another? That we are not only part of nature but also part of a single organism? Will we honor the passion we felt for kindness? Will we, in other words, stay true to the version we glimpsed of our better selves: that of generosity, heroism and compassion? Or will we yield to the dark calls of those who insist that the lessons to take from this are that we should fear the stranger even more, build higher walls and practice a resolute policy of intolerance to difference and to reason? Our history shows that we are paradoxically good at learning from the past as well as remaining somewhat unchanged by it.\nPerhaps Ruges images returned to me because, as with my friend Caroline, the current circumstances have altered my attention. I think this is one of the ways that art works; it is there for our pleasure but also as a tool for thinking. It helps us consider the present and our place in it. It is what has made Caroline stop at the Gainsborough, and it is also what has made me recall images by a largely forgotten photographer whose work I had seen only in passing several years ago and in reproduction. And from this perspective, it suddenly seems that The Painters Daughters Chasing a Butterfly and I Photograph Myself During a Parachute Jump are connected. I think it was the wariness and suspended state of danger and threat in the Gainsborough that helped bring to mind Ruges photographs. Both are about a suspended moment, where the consequences are in question; a moment, in other words, not too dissimilar from where we find ourselves today.\nIllustration by Brian Rea.\nHisham Matar is the author of the novels In the Country of Men and Anatomy of a Disappearance and the memoirs The Return and A Month in Siena.

It was the last day I ate at a restaurant, the last day I went to a concert (Red Baraat at the Sinclair in Cambridge, Mass.) and the last day I hugged a friend. It was also the first time I thought that I should begin writing about what was going on.\nThat thought was immediately followed by its negation: Why bother? The same incidents, the same references and the same outrages would inevitably be picked over by other writers; for all our social distancing, wed all be crowding around the same material. I also knew that anything I wrote could soon be  in fact was almost certain to be  contradicted by new developments. But what worried me most was that certain points of emphasis in my writing would later prove to have been misjudged, and that this would somehow reveal that my heart had been in the wrong place all along.\nBy mid-April, the daily death toll had risen to terrifying heights. But then those numbers fluctuated and at times fell, and it appeared that the worst was over. We seemed to be in for a significant sequence of days. So I set down a weeks worth of observations, hoping to capture, with no attempt at being comprehensive, a time when my feelings were as raw as my understanding of what was happening.\nSaturday, April 11\n\nYesterdays death toll from Covid-19 in New York State was 996 people. It is unbelievable to be living through this. I am in Cambridge, but I am obsessed by the New York numbers. We know that history is not over, that enormous events are inevitable. But the mind takes time to adjust. It still feels unreal to wake up every morning in a world as strange as dreams.\nI saw a photograph by a Bosnian photographer named Ziyah Gafic. Posted on his Instagram account, it showed undertakers in a Sarajevo graveyard. There were four of them, seated, standing, resting on gravestones. They were masked and clad in the full-body white suits of the familiar new priesthood. I was reminded of a pen-and-ink drawing of beekeepers by Bruegel. The same muffled air of mystery.\nMy sister, a doctor in Michigan, texted me a couple of days ago: My first patient today was a 22-year-old prison worker who had been exposed and was now short of breath.

From time to time a cardinal appears, like a splash of red paint.\nA scene in a film I watched the other day  a not very good one from 2013 called On My Way, starring Catherine Deneuve  was set in a restaurant. The clinking of glasses, that sound alone, filled me with such longing. Much of what I miss is tied to dumb privilege. And yesterday, outside the wine shop (speaking of privilege) in nearby Belmont, as a number of us waited for our pickup  masked, observing appropriate social distance  one man with a thick Latin American accent said: Is like a movie. But nobody waking yet. I was suddenly spooked, as in a dream when you become aware youre in a dream only after someone says it.\nMonday, April 13\n\nYesterdays death toll from Covid-19 in New York State was 957 people. My mother turned 70 last week. A few days before her birthday, she sent a carefully worded text to all her friends and family asking them to celebrate with her by staying in their homes. My parents live in Lagos, Nigeria, and they are taking the quarantine rules seriously. Their daily situation over there is much the same as mine here in Cambridge. We are fortunate in the same ways: There is enough food in the pantry for a few weeks, and there is no pressing need to leave the house. It is hard for others in Nigeria. Huge numbers of daily wage earners, street traders and informal workers have to feed themselves and their dependents. How are they doing it? Asking certain people to stay home for the sake of society is absurd, because these are people society has never cared about. Stay home so people wont die is a hell of a thing to say to those who are dying of hunger. I keep thinking about floods, and how only after the waters recede do the bodies of the drowned become visible.\nIm listening to kora music played by Ballak Sissoko. Im listening to Beethoven, the early sonatas.

It surprises me that I can still listen to so much music every day, and that I still want to. Listening to MF DOOM, I find myself thinking about what hip-hop is and what it means in a moment like this. Music of all kinds thrives socially, but some genres tolerate solitude better than others. Hip-hop isnt really alive unless someone else hears it: It is social all the way down to its genetic code. These days, DJ Nice is hosting parties that are viewed by a huge audience on Instagram Live. Last weekend, also on Instagram Live, there was a battle between DJ Premier, who was spinning from isolation in New York, and RZA, who was spinning from isolation in California. I watched and listened with thousands of others, creating with them the feeling of being in a crowd, wishing that the crowd could be embodied.\nWednesday, April 15\n\nYesterdays death toll from Covid-19 in New York State was 1,003 people. It is a clear, bright day in Cambridge. Flowers are blooming outside. K fills the house with cuttings from her tulip beds and from the cherry tree. There are four grinning daffodils in a clear vase.\nPeople are dying in hospitals and dying at home. The official tolls are almost certainly an undercount. The morgues are overflowing. Those are the facts. But where is the grief? When we first started getting the news out of Italy, and then Spain, with frightening daily numbers comparable with what is now happening in New York, that news seemed to be delivered with holy awe. In El Pas, for example, each days news was led by the previous days dead, a number that was often in the papers main headline. In the American papers, I usually have to do some searching to find how many people have died in the past day. The front pages here seem to often carry news of the financial markets or of the political squabbles of the day. But what I want is to be directly confronted with the fact, the enormity, the irreducible sadness of all these deaths.\nA friend of mine attended a Zoom funeral last week for his grandmother. My neighbor attended a Zoom funeral last week for his father. A tragic, sordid phrase that wouldnt have meant anything just a few weeks ago: Zoom funeral. Zoom is a for-profit company, and it is currently very profitable.\nThursday, April 16\n\nYesterdays death toll from Covid-19 in New York State was 936 people. The numbers are bad in Massachusetts, over a hundred per day at the moment, but nowhere near as grim as in New York.\nI talked to my mother on the phone. She says there are roving gangs of young men in Lagos. They are stopping and raiding food trucks and sometimes invading peoples homes. I tell her, thinking of Jean Valjean, that you can hardly blame a hungry man for stealing bread. She says, Thats true, but how would you feel if it was your home they invaded?\nI havent been outside in a few days. I go out after 4 p.m., and the streets are busy with walkers and joggers. There is a profusion of beautiful spring flowers, and many more masks on the streets now, in keeping with the latest directives. Im wearing one.\nIn Bruegels drawing, there are three beekeepers and a fourth person, whose body is turned away from us. He has climbed up a tree, presumably to take the eggs out of a birds nest. Is the drawing meant to contrast the active life (the man in the tree) with the contemplative life (the beekeepers)? No one knows for sure. Its not only the atmosphere of the drawing that is mysterious; its meaning, too, is unknown and has eluded generations of scholars.\nWhen I return from my walk, I have a phone chat with my cousin, who works as a sorter at one of Amazons warehouses in the Atlanta area. She immigrated to the United States in September and has just been upgraded to full-time status at the warehouse.

She tells me shes being offered overtime, for good pay, but that she doesnt want to do it because of the elevated risk.\nUnbelievable to be living through this? No, its believable. I believe it, the way you wake up in the middle of the night on a trans-Atlantic flight and believe: I am 35,000 feet above sea level, moving at tremendous speed through freezing air.\nFriday, April 17\n\nYesterdays death toll from Covid-19 in New York State was 732 people. I can hardly concentrate in daytime. At night, I read Annie Ernauxs The Years. You can feel the pulse and intelligence of Ernauxs mind, her technical facility, the range of her assessments over several decades of French history. The book, which mixes history with memoir, is good writing. Eventually, there will be good writing about our moment as well. If journalism is the first rough draft of history, perhaps a journal is the first rough draft of literature. But grief makes me sour. I feel as though Ive read the same piece of white writing 30 times in the past month.\nMuch of it is concerned with inconveniences, and some of it is jokey. I understand these collective attempts at lightness, but I quarrel with them, because I know that in the United States there is no collective. Levity in the midst of sorrow can be a consolation if the sorrow is shared to begin with. But here, where everything is divided, where the unscathed cant quite believe the wounded, the levity sounds like anything but solidarity. Covid-19 was initially heralded as a great equalizer, and there was some evidence of this in some countries. But it arrived in America and immediately became American: classist, capitalist, complacent.\nThe words Samuel Beckett wrote to his friend Alan Schneider in 1963 feel like a lifeline: I offer you only my deeply affectionate and compassionate thoughts and wish for you only that the strange thing may never fail you, whatever it is, that gives us the strength to live on and on with our wounds.\nSaturday, April 18\n\nYesterdays death toll from Covid-19 in New York State was 804 people. Theres consolation in the falling numbers, sure, but I mostly think about how, with better leadership, far fewer people would be bereaved right now. But leaders are nothing without their followers, and many Americans have decided to inhabit an alternate reality. What is newly shocking is realizing that their fanciful reality is impervious to everything, even a horrifying daily death toll.\nIt began to rain just before I slept last night. This morning there was snow on the ground in patches. K had read the weather report. To protect her roses, she had brought in what she could and had covered what she couldnt. The tulips out front look sad. The small birds are at the feeder, but theres no squirrel to bother them. Its almost a week since I saw the cardinal. My sister has her first week off in a very long time. Being a doctor means witnessing suffering and death, but this past month has been something else. I feel visceral relief for her, as though I were the one on vacation.\nI want to weep. I cant weep; I cant write either. Is shock necessarily nave? Cant it also be evidence of taking in, and being affected by, new information?\nIm still thinking about Zoom funerals. Theres good reason the earliest surviving traces of many civilizations have to do with the burial of the dead: tombs, barrows, tumuli. In Sophocles Antigone, King Creon denies funeral rites to Polynices. Polynices is dead anyway and wont know in what manner his body is disposed of  but Antigone knows, and we know, and it is what the living know that matters. Our need for proper ritual will never subside.\nWe are eager to find out what an old text can say to our new situation. But Antigone wont tell you what to do in the time of Covid-19. The play is about individual conscience against the state, loyalty to family, funerary customs, the clash between two varieties of self-contradiction and, above all, the workings of tragedy. Tragedy is not simply that something bad happens; its that one thing leads to another: if this, then that, and if that, then the other thing. In Seamus Heaneys version of Antigone, The Burial at Thebes, he has the chorus declare: It starts like an undulation underwater,/A surge that hauls black sand up off the bottom,/Then turns itself into a tidal current. . . .\nOne thing leads to another. Polynices dies in battle, and Antigone, for defying the directive to leave him unburied, is sentenced to death. She hangs herself. Haemon, to whom she was engaged, kills himself with a sword. Eurydice, grieving her son, also commits suicide. Hubris, cruelty, and next thing you know, an entire generation is brought to grief. We can see the tidal current and the wreckage in its wake; but why has it happened? All we know is that different choices would have led to a different outcome.\nTeju Cole teaches writing at Harvard.

I read the series of tweets detailing all the precautions that salons and customers would be taking: wiping down chairs regularly, disinfecting combs, wearing masks. The tweets told me that I needed to be smart and stay cautious, but that the worst was over, cosmetologically speaking. After three months, one week and six days, I could call my braider, Sonia, once again and pay $150 for her to spend six to eight hours slowly yanking my hair into dozens of tidy, light braids, completed mostly during commercial breaks of talk shows, while I ran down my phone battery and balanced Chinese takeout on my lap. I couldnt get her on the phone fast enough.\nSince adolescence, my hair has been a steady proxy for my anxieties: I can track extreme stress by the nightmares Ive had of sudden hair loss or a botched chemical job. In the most important ways, Ive been spared by Covid-19  my family healthy, my job secure, my lodgings stable  but Ive still been restless with worry, unable to fall asleep before dawn. During those sleepless hours, I watched YouTube hair tutorials, each one titled with a technique (most natural crochet ever, easy protective style) and a promise (UNDER TWO HOURS, easy enough for beginners). Maybe I could learn something new.\nIve never known how to do much with my hair because I never wanted to learn: Somewhere in middle school I got it in my head that smart women didnt care about their looks, and all photos from the following decade prove that I took that to heart. As a child, I bonded with my mother or grandmother or sisters on nights when I could harangue them into wrapping my chemically straightened hair under a scarf. In college, Id visit a salon during academic breaks, then persuade my friends to get the back of my head when I later touched up my roots with relaxer, but mostly I kept my hair short. For a majority of the past decade, Ive let a braider handle my hair, rarely styling it myself beyond slicking it up into a bun or just letting it assume its own shape.\nThe pernicious theory that natural black hair is difficult to take care of is only true if youre extremely lazy, which I am. I regard doing my hair regularly with the same enthusiasm as brushing my teeth or filing expenses  banalities that counterbalance the dance parties and first dates and beach days of life. Accordingly, Ive worn my hair in the same exact style for six years. I first had it braided on a whim one summer afternoon and quickly decided that Id never do it again. But then I bungled removing the braids, getting the extensions so knotted in with my actual hair that I had to cut out both, after which I decided that having braids for a while might be nice, actually. Ive maintained them through changes in addresses and dress sizes and jobs and relationships, through tattoos added on my arms and nose rings extracted from my face, the most enduring change to my body Id ever paid for. Every morning and evening, at home or away, in darkness or in light, sick, sad, drunk, I have looked at myself and seen the braids too.\nBut confined in my apartment for the past two months, I recognize very little about my life. The faces of my friends, now lit by their computer screens, seem slightly off, distorted by grief or fatigue or technology; my neighborhood is unnaturally hushed, devoid of the charcoal smokers dotting the sidewalk that mark the onset of nice weather; my handwriting has deteriorated from disuse. A few days before the stay-at-home orders began in New York, I took my braids down in preparation for my next appointment, leaving my hair to erupt into springy sections. So in the mirror now, my image is never quite what I expect to see. I feel mildly disoriented, as if I had followed a recipe but somehow the dish didnt come out the way it looked in the picture. I had worn braids not for vanity but for control: without them, my hair, emboldened with its own direction, often looks the way it wants to, which can be different every day. With them, I look exactly the same, day in and day out, and I dont have to do a thing.\nDuring the first few days of self-isolation, my hair was my victory garden: I tended to it, feeding it protein and moisture, oil and cremes, throwing myself into its maintenance just to give myself something to do. I clarified it with Aztec clay, I rinsed it with apple-cider vinegar, I softened it with shea butter, I grew it with biotin. Over time, though, the instinct to settle my idle hands decreased, and in its place arose the desire for self-recognition. Its not that I dont like how I appear in the mirror now but rather that Ive had very little say in the matter. Our personal choices have eroded; in isolation, Id expected to miss all the normal things, like joining my friends late at dinner or running into someone on the subway, but Ive been surprised by the other things: putting on eyeliner, wearing a new perfume, the temporary alterations that feel like a necessary part of autonomy.\nStyle, then, feels like the last indulgence. Economists cite the lipstick effect, a glossy theory that, in times of upheaval, sales of small indulgences like cosmetics increase  hard-won treats that lessen the impact. In the past few months, by some counts, nail-polish -purchases- have soared, most likely to people eager for a diversion. (Or maybe because were staring at our hands more than ever.) The results of our bodies left to their own devices  leg hair unwaxed, bangs overgrown, grays returning  seem striking because we cant fix what we dont like as easily as before. Most of the time, we can look more or less how we want, within good reason, but self-isolation has forced aesthetic choices on us, reducing us to mere bodies awaiting the inevitable.\nThe interim between what we look like now, dead-eyed and bushy all over, and how we might want to look feels like a vacation that has gone on for too long, its appeal loosening by the day. Some people have resorted to the drastic, shaving and dyeing and bleaching and growing out, sprinting toward the unknown. But for the most part, all I wanted is for something to resemble the way it appeared to me before.\nHoled up in my home, I did not feel the same, a state I had limited control over, but I also did not look the same, and I figured that was the one thing I could change. In the middle of the night, I am convinced I can do anything, and after a few YouTube videos, I figured I could try, for the first time, to spend an hour blowing out my hair, another braiding it into eight neat cornrows that lay flat against my skull, braid those braids into a single braid, then loop 100 faux dreadlocks into each cornrow. The women on my screen made it look quick and easy; my insomnia reasoned that it gave me something to do.\nSo one Saturday morning, I angled my laptop on my bathroom sink, a tutorial queued up  in the harsh reality of day  to do a measly two cornrows. My first attempt went poorly  I tried to get the braids to adhere to the length of my scalp, but they crept off the nape of my neck no matter how many times I restarted. (One comment to the tutorial read: Shout-out to all my black girls who still dont understand how to cornrow even after watching all the videos on YouTube.) I wore them for four days anyway, a giddy black Pippi Longstocking. I began idly braiding my hair while on the phone or watching TV, the plaits growing smaller, my completion time shortening, my fingers becoming used to their job. My long-held evasion had stopped making sense  this wasnt that bad! I speculated about my burgeoning expertise: Maybe I could start a natural hair YouTube channel myself; maybe Id be the valued friend who can do hair. I stood to make so much money when this was all over! I looked in the mirror after a blind braiding during a long phone call. Practice had not made perfect. Practice had barely made OK.\nI gave up on the dream of the eight cornrows. The YouTube algorithm led me to something easier: Marley twists, done with a particular type of synthetic hair, attached to the scalp with skillfully hidden rubber bands. They werent the same as box braids, but theyd provide the same heft, the approximate length, the framing around my face in the bathroom mirror. The beauty-supply store in my neighborhood remained open, stocked with masks and gloves and bundles of hair. The tutorial promised I could complete it in under two hours, which it underestimated by about two hours. The final result turned out sloppy and elementary  the parts are not well defined, the rubber band is too far away from the root, I ran out of hair. But I am comforted by its weight. Without thinking, Ive restarted my habit of gathering up the strands and tying them into a bun on my head, grasping at anything familiar.\nIllustration by Brian Rea.\nJazmine Hughes is a story editor for the magazine.

His book Death Wins a Goldfish was published last year.\nThe Truth About Cocoons What caterpillars really go through in there has applications for our moment.\nEvery child knows about cocoons. Theyre one of the first things we learn about the natural world. What the ABCs are to language, cocoons are to biology. They introduce us to the wonder of metamorphosis: A little blobby squirmy thing disappears into a sac and emerges as a flamboyant colorful flappy thing. Magic! In fact, that is exactly how we tend to learn about it  as one of natures great magic tricks, if not inexplicable then largely unexplained. The emphasis always seems to be on the before and the after, never the during.\nLately, I have found myself wondering  as I sit here hunched inside my dark house, for infinity weeks, hardly moving, wearing the same green sweatshirt while eating the same four snacks  about cocoons. I dont really care anymore what goes in or what comes out; those are questions for different times, for ancient pasts and distant futures. Im interested in precisely the part of the story that tends to be skipped: the confinement, the waiting, the darkness, the change.\nWhat is it actually like inside a cocoon? Is it cozy and peaceful? Or cramped and dim? Is the bugs stay voluntary, involuntary or something in between? And what really happens during that seemingly magical change? Is it inspiring and wondrous? Or is it unpleasant and grim? What did I not learn in kindergarten?\nIt turns out that the inside of a cocoon is  at least by outside-of-a-cocoon standards  pretty bleak. Terrible things happen in there: a campaign of grisly desolation that would put most horror movies to shame. What a caterpillar is doing, in its self--imposed quarantine, is basically digesting itself. It is using enzymes to reduce its body to goo, turning itself into a soup of ex-caterpillar  a nearly formless sludge oozing around a couple of leftover essential organs (tracheal tubes, gut).\nOnly after this near-total self-annihilation can the new growth begin. Inside that gruesome mush are special clusters of cells called imaginal discs, which sounds like something from a Disney movie but which I have been assured is actual biology. Imaginal discs are basically the seeds of crucial butterfly structures: eyes, wings, genitalia and so on. These parts gorge themselves on the protein of the deconstructed caterpillar, growing exponentially, taking form, becoming real. Thats how you get a butterfly: out of the horrid meltdown of a modest caterpillar.\nThe caterpillar I know best was created, out of scraps of painted paper, by a man who grew up in Nazi Germany: Eric Carle. The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a small, eccentric masterpiece  a childrens book, yes, but also a formative exploration of the complex nature of change. Like many children, I read the book so many times that it blended into my psyche as a kind of background color. Years later, I read it again so many times with my own children that it blended into their psyches too, and back into my own again, this time in a deeper color.\nRecently, when I reread The Very Hungry Caterpillar alone, in quarantine, it felt less like reading than remembering. And yet I was also slightly surprised. Carles caterpillar is, of course, more than just a caterpillar; it is a classic existentialist antihero  a lonely creature of pure need, guided by only its own ravenousness, skirting the knifes edge between self-destruction and growth. What surprised me this time was that so little of the book is devoted to that final act of transformation  the magic change we are always taught to anticipate. Mainly, the book is a catalog of eating. Ridiculous, ceaseless, maniacal, necessary but also unwise eating.\nThings start out fine. The caterpillar tunnels through one food after another: an apple on Monday, two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday and so forth. He always leaves a little hole in his wake, a literal hole in the books pages  his hunger is so powerful that it begins to destroy the very story of his hunger. By Saturday, the caterpillar has abandoned all sense and started bingeing on junk food: a piece of chocolate cake, an ice cream cone, a pickle, a slice of cherry pie, a cupcake  the kind of caloric intake, surely, that will not help an insect with its ultimate long-term goals. Sure enough, the caterpillar ends up curled at the bottom of the page with a stomachache, eyes squished and drooping, mouth compressed to a miserable line.\nThis moment in the book hit me deeply. Staring into that caterpillars wretched face felt like looking into a mirror. In quarantine, I, too, have been ravenously bingeing. When I pass through a room, I leave it practically riddled with holes. I have worked my way through bags of chips, bags of gummy candy, bags of unsalted walnuts, jars of peanut butter, tubs of ice cream, boxes of cereal. And the consumption goes far beyond food. Along with the rest of America, I devoured the cursed docu-series Tiger King with hardly a break. I have been playing so many hours of the Nintendo game Animal Crossing that my wife sometimes peeks cautiously into the room and asks: Is there some way I can help you? Are you sure you want to still be playing this?\nI am speaking to you now from the inside of my cocoon. You, presumably, are listening from inside your own. It could be an apartment, a room, a closet or a farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere on the site of an abandoned commune. Perhaps, like me, you have been living a self-destructive quarantine cocoon life. Maybe you are not using junk food or video games to numb the pain, but you are probably using something. The data suggests that most of us are. A friend recently sent me his phones weekly screen-time report. It was down 15 percent, to 10 hours 50 minutes a day. Utility companies say that people are sleeping in  spikes in energy use that typically occurred around 6 a.m. are now happening much later. The very shape of society is dissolving in front of our eyes. Workdays, mealtimes, holidays  all these rituals that were designed to help us shape our days have now been drained of meaning. Society has become, in large part, boneless. A soup of ex-society.\nWatching it happen, all over the planet, has been horrible. There is no other word for it. It has been horrible inside overrun hospitals  the multiplying hopelessness, the gasping of those who cant be saved. It has been differently horrible inside our own houses, where we wonder how to help as we refresh internet spreadsheets and watch the numbers rise: cases, tests, deaths. It has been horrible to read about the stories behind those numbers. It has been horrible to watch for tiny signs of illness in the people we love the most. Horrible to feel our own foreheads, wondering if we are warm. Horrible to be warm. Horrible to be cool. Horrible not to be sure.\nHow do we even begin to process all of this  this cataclysm that is happening simultaneously in slow motion and all at once, on distant continents and inside our own cells? Months in, we still have no idea when it will end or what we will all come out looking like. The metamorphoses are happening mostly in private, all over the place, in billions of individual pods  acts of internal self--destruction and rebuilding, subtle shifts and whole revolutions.\nI keep asking myself, as pretzel crumbs spill down the front of my sweatshirt, what I have learned from quarantine. On most days, honestly, it feels like nothing. The main question we seem to answer in quarantine is circular: How would we handle ourselves in quarantine? On particularly bad days, as I blink myself awake at 11 a.m. and promptly reopen Twitter, I feel that Ive actually learned less than nothing  that my knowledge is rolling backward. Before the world shut down, I swear on my Cool Ranch Doritos, I was working on myself, exercising regularly and making plans and sticking to them. I was generating lists, and lists of lists, and lists of lists of lists. I listened to a whole audiobook about forming good habits. But now all of that has gone away. For the moment at least, in the face of this horror and sadness and confusion, as I watch the curves grow worse on the terrifying graphs, my fantasies of self--improvement have evaporated. Maybe they werent essential. Maybe they needed to be rethought. Or maybe they just needed to go dormant for a while.\nA caterpillar doesnt choose to go into its cocoon. Cocoon, actually, in the case of butterflies, is the wrong word. My apologies to Eric Carle, but it is actually a chrysalis, a hard shell that was inside the caterpillars body the whole time. From the ancient Greek chrysos, gold  a golden envelope of internal self--destruction. In order to expose the chrysalis, the caterpillar just has to slough off its chubby outer layer. It seals itself inside itself. No decision is really made; its just a matter of hormonal cascades  cues beyond the understanding of the creature being cued. The caterpillar stays inside because it has to. And when it comes out, it is a different thing. We tell that story one way. The caterpillar no doubt experiences it very differently.\nIs a butterflys life any better than a caterpillars? Was all that suffering in the cocoon worth it? Is a volcano happier after it erupts? These are childrens questions. It doesnt even make sense to ask. The bug has no choice. The cocoon is forced upon it. And then nature runs its course.\nBut here is one thing I have learned in quarantine: The world can stop. This is not a small thing, nor is it easy. It is not necessarily good or bad. History teaches us, again and again, that change does not mean progress, that metamorphosis does not mean improvement. When society dissolves, we  the ones who make up society  dissolve right along with it. When our familiar structures become unrecognizable, we become unrecognizable to ourselves. This means suffering. We are confused and miserable and terrified and heart-broken. We find ourselves continually annoyed with our families. We sleep too long or not long enough, eat too much or not enough. We stop exercising and attend absurd virtual meetings meant to simulate work or school. We clap outside at 7 p.m.\nBut I believe that the situation, as bleak as it may seem, may also contain the seeds of its own transformation  somewhere very deep in the formless mush.\nLets not forget that in our horrendous confusion  in spite of it, because of it  we managed to do something amazing. We chose to go dormant. We changed almost everything in the world, almost overnight. This required a kind of collective action that, frankly, would have struck me as impossible five months ago. There are, of course, outliers, loudmouths and nihilists and malcontents. They will always exist. But enough people are not that. Enough of us have found enough reasons to change, and it has made an actual difference. We are in the middle of creating whatever the new world will be. We did it, and we are doing it, every day.\nMeanwhile, I am still sitting here in my chrysalis, ravenous, sad, confused, feeling simultaneously changed and unchanged. Perhaps one of these afternoons, many months from now, I will be nibbling away at whatever happens to be in front of me, and it will turn out not to be more gummy bears but something else, the actual wall of my enclosure, and I will eat enough to make a hole, and then I will look out, with a whole new kind of eyes, to see what sort of world is waiting for me, and what I have become in it.\nIllustration by Brian Rea.\nSam Anderson is a staff writer for the magazine and the author of Boom Town, a book about Oklahoma City.

There is no indication of any visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image appears to be an authentic representation of a scene in Manhattan. The image's setting (flags on buildings, street signs) shows a clear urban scene, with architectural features consistent with Manhattan. The time of day appears to be midday, supporting the caption's time element (noontime rush).

The description of the image as an 'abstract image of a lion laying dead' aligns with the visual content. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  The external check indicates that the image is part of a series of conceptual photographs by artist George Logan, symbolizing the decline of the lion population. This contradicts the caption's claim of depicting a dead lion in Trafalgar Square as a factual event. The external evidence suggests that the scene is a staged artistic representation and not an actual event, thus rendering the original caption out of context. The discrepancy arises from the interpretative nature of the image; while internally the description fits, externally, the context is of an artistic statement and not a news report. The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty, given the conflicting nature of the internal and external evidence.  It is important to note that while the internal check accurately describes the visual components of the image, the external evidence provides crucial context that fundamentally alters the meaning of the caption. The claim of a 'dead lion' in Trafalgar Square requires factual evidence, which the external source denies.  The image, while potentially depicting a dead lion (in the context of the artistic statement), does not represent a news-worthy event of a lion dying in Trafalgar Square. Therefore, the caption's interpretation, based solely on visual cues, is out of context when considering the artistic purpose revealed by external validation. The visual elements do not lie; a lion is present, seemingly dead, on a plinth in a place resembling Trafalgar Square.  The key issue is the interpretation and context surrounding this depiction.  The internal check is accurate in its description of the image's visual components, but the external check provides crucial missing context that transforms the image from a literal description of a real event to an artistic expression of a concept. This contextual shift makes the original caption inaccurate and out of context.",

            "content": "Claim:\nA video captures a cat with an extremely deep meow.\nIn May 2017, a 2015 video featuring a cat with an unusually deep voice inexplicably went viral, and was duly picked up by various tabloids:\nDont let this cats small stature fool you  he has a bass voice that would put Barry White to shame.\nIn a video filmed by the kittys owner, hes just chilling on the kitchen counter. Unsurprisingly, his ridiculously low voice has gone viral, with a lot of people wondering how its physically possible for such a tiny cat to produce such a noise.\nThere are several reasons to be skeptical about this footage. The video was originally posted to YouTube by \"Cash CatFlava\" in December 2015, bearing the description \"So this is Jack and he has some sort of type of laryngeal paralysis? At least thats what the vet told me.\"\nSome cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: \"While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat's meow, I've yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat's meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn't change over time!\"\nAccording to the American College of Veterinarian Surgeons, a cat with laryngeal paralysis may display harsh panting or a coarse (not deeper) voice:\nIn dogs and cats with laryngeal paralysis, the muscles that normally pull the airway open do not function properly. When an affected pet breathes in, the walls of the airway do not pull openrather, they are sucked into the opening, or in severe cases sucked shut. Early in the condition, this creates increased noise when they breathe; later, it can completely obstruct their airway, and they can suffocate. The early signs of laryngeal paralysis can be quite subtle.\nYou may notice:\nharshness in their panting\nincreased panting or panting when cool and calm\na hoarse or raspy-sounding bark\nA video of a cat suffering from laryngeal paralysis shows that their meows are not comically deep, but squeaky (and arguably a little sad):\nOur attempts to find similar videos of cats with unusually deep voices were unsuccessful. In fact, the only similar video we could uncover was uploaded by the same YouTube account, Cash Cat Flava, in October 2013:\nSetting aside for the moment what a coincidence it would be that the same person has come across two cats with laryngeal paralysis who sound identical, this video actually gives itself away as a fakery in the first few seconds. Before the cat exits the house, you can hear audio of its actual regular-pitched meow.",

Since that video was fake  it featured computer generated imagery  we were skeptical when we came across a similar video in January 2021 supposedly showing a bear chasing a skier down a mountain.\nThis is a real video.\nThe Romanian news outlet Digi 24 reported that this video was filmed on a ski slope in Predeal, Romania. The incident was filmed by multiple people on the chairlift who watched the scene unfold below. Digi 24 reports that the people on the chairlift yelled (translated via Google):\n\"Give it faster, give it faster! Come on, the bear is chasing you ! Give it faster! God forbid, don't look back!\"\nHere's another video of the incident:\nThe man in the video escaped unharmed.\nIon Zaharia, the county gendarmerie inspectorate, said that when the person realized what was happening, the skier threw a backpack on the ground. This distracted the bear and allowed the person to ski to safety.\nA video report from Obiectiv 3 shows the bear ending the pursuit after finding the bag.\nOfficials on the mountain said that they may  as they have done when similar situations arose in years past  attempt to relocate the bear away from the ski slopes.\nThis incident may seem unusual to some viewers as they have been told (incorrectly) that one way to evade a bear is to run (or ski) downhill. Bears, however, can run downhills at surprising speeds. According to the National Wildlife Federation, bears are nearly as fast as horses, and can reach speeds of 35 mph:\nMyth: Bears cant run downhill.\nIf youre being chased by a bear, dont run downhill! Bears can run as fast as a horse (35 mph), and they can do it uphill, downhill, and everything in between. A bear can outrun you no matter what, so if you see one in the wild do not try to run away from it. Instead, you should stand tall, wave your arms, and talk loudly but calmly. Back away slowly, but stop moving if the bear follows you.",

However, external validation, while agreeing on the core event of a bear chasing someone downhill, introduces a discrepancy. The external source mentions a bear chasing a skier, not a bicyclist. This discrepancy, although not completely contradictory, reduces the overall confidence. The external source's lower confidence score of 8 reflects this uncertainty.  While the core event aligns—a large animal chasing someone downhill—the specific details differ. The visual evidence strongly supports the presence of a bicyclist, not a skier. The image clearly shows a cyclist on a road bicycle, eliminating any reasonable doubt about the type of vehicle involved. Therefore, the external source's mention of a skier is likely an unrelated incident or a misinterpretation.  The difference between \"cyclist\" and \"skier\" alters the context enough to make the caption potentially out-of-context. Although the core action is similar, the mode of transportation is quite different, suggesting potentially distinct situations. The overall assessment leans towards the visual evidence and the strong internal validation, concluding the caption is slightly inaccurate. The confidence score is lowered to reflect the discrepancy and the external source's lower confidence score. In summary, the image supports the action described in the caption, but the specific details about the person being chased (cyclist vs. skier) create enough uncertainty to label the caption out of context.",

The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

            "date": "2020-10-17T05:01:00",
            "content": "Kathy spotted the long line of voters as she pulled into the Christian City Welcome Center about 3:30 p.m., ready to cast her ballot in the June 9 primary election.\nHundreds of people were waiting in the heat and rain outside the lush, tree-lined complex in Union City, an Atlanta suburb with 22,400 residents, nearly 88% of them Black. She briefly considered not casting a ballot at all, but decided to stay.\nBy the time she got inside more than five hours later, the polls had officially closed and the electronic scanners were shut down. Poll workers told her she'd have to cast a provisional ballot, but they promised that her vote would be counted.\n\"I'm now angry again, I'm frustrated again, and now I have an added emotion, which is anxiety,\" said Kathy, a human services worker, recalling her emotions at the time. She asked that her full name not be used because she fears repercussions from speaking out. \"I'm wondering if my ballot is going to count.\"\nBy the time the last voter finally got inside the welcome center to cast a ballot, it was the next day, June 10.\nThe clogged polling locations in metro Atlanta reflect an underlying pattern: the number of places to vote has shrunk statewide, with little recourse. Although the reduction in polling places has taken place across racial lines, it has primarily caused long lines in nonwhite neighborhoods where voter registration has surged and more residents cast ballots in person on Election Day. The pruning of polling places started long before the pandemic, which has discouraged people from voting in person.\nIn Georgia, considered a battleground state for control of the White House and U.S. Senate, the difficulty of voting in Black communities like Union City could possibly tip the results on Nov. 3. With massive turnout expected, lines could be even longer than they were for the primary, despite a rise in mail-in voting and Georgians already turning out by the hundreds of thousands to cast ballots early.\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court's Shelby v. Holder decision in 2013 eliminated key federal oversight of election decisions in states with histories of discrimination, Georgia's voter rolls have grown by nearly 2 million people, yet polling locations have been cut statewide by nearly 10%, according to an analysis of state and local records by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica. Much of the growth has been fueled by younger, nonwhite voters, especially in nine metro Atlanta counties, where four out of five new voters were nonwhite, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.\nThe metro Atlanta area has been hit particularly hard. The nine counties  Fulton, Gwinnett, Forsyth, DeKalb, Cobb, Hall, Cherokee, Henry and Clayton  have nearly half of the state's active voters but only 38% of the polling places, according to the analysis.\nAs a result, the average number of voters packed into each polling location in those counties grew by nearly 40%, from about 2,600 in 2012 to more than 3,600 per polling place as of Oct. 9, the analysis shows. In addition, a last-minute push that opened more than 90 polling places just weeks before the November election has left many voters uncertain about where to vote or how long they might wait to cast a ballot.\nThe growth in registered voters has outstripped the number of available polling places in both predominantly white and Black neighborhoods. But the lines to vote have been longer in Black areas, because Black voters are more likely than whites to cast their ballots in person on Election Day and are more reluctant to vote by mail, according to U.S. census data and recent studies. Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica found that about two-thirds of the polling places that had to stay open late for the June primary to accommodate waiting voters were in majority-Black neighborhoods, even though they made up only about one-third of the state's polling places. An analysis by Stanford University political science professor Jonathan Rodden of the data collected by Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica found that the average wait time after 7 p.m. across Georgia was 51 minutes in polling places that were 90% or more nonwhite, but only six minutes in polling places that were 90% white.\nGeorgia law sets a cap of 2,000 voters for a polling place that has experienced significant voter delays, but that limit is rarely, if ever, enforced. Our analysis found that, in both majority Black and majority white neighborhoods, about nine of every 10 precincts are assigned to polling places with more than 2,000 people.\nA June 2020 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School found that the average number of voters assigned to a polling place has grown in the past five years in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina  all states with substantial Black populations that before the Shelby decision needed federal approval to close polling places under the Voting Rights Act. And though dozens of states have regulations on the size of voting precincts and polling places or the number of voting machines, the analysis found that many jurisdictions do not abide by them.\nGeorgia's state leadership and elections officials have largely ignored complaints about poll consolidations even as they tout record growth in voter registration. As secretary of state from 2010 to 2018, when most of Georgia's poll closures occurred, Brian Kemp, now the governor, took a laissez-faire attitude toward county-run election practices, save for a 2015 document that spelled out methods officials could use to shutter polling places to show \"how the change can benefit voters and the public interest.\"\nKemp's office declined to comment Thursday on the letter or why poll closures went unchallenged by state officials. His spokesperson referred to his previous statements that he did not encourage officials to close polling places but merely offered guidance on how to follow the law.\nThe inaction has left Black voters in Georgia facing barriers reminiscent of Jim Crow laws, said Adrienne Jones, a political science professor at Morehouse College in Atlanta who has studied the impact of the landmark Shelby decision on Black voters.\nVoter suppression \"is happening with these voter impediments that are being imposed,\" Jones said.\n\"You're closing down polling places so people have a more difficult time getting there. You're making vote-by-mail difficult or confusing. Now we're in court arguing about which ballots are going to be accepted, and it means that people have less trust in our state.\"\nIn August, on the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and three Georgia voters sued the state and more than a dozen counties in federal court, alleging that some of the state's most populous areas have disenfranchised voters for more than a decade with long lines caused by inadequate staff, training, equipment and voting locations.\nThe suit, which was dismissed after the judge ruled the parties had no standing to file, warned of upheaval on Nov. 3, Election Day.\n\"As bad as the situation would be in normal circumstances, the burden is made far worse by the global pandemic,\" the lawsuit stated. \"Absent judicial intervention, Georgia is set for more of the same (and likely far worse than it has ever seen) in November.\"\nRepublican Brad Raffensperger, who took over as secretary of state in January 2019, has called for more resources and polling places, but he has been unable to push these changes through the GOP-controlled legislature.\nRaffensperger's office blames Democrats and county elections officials for opposing his efforts to improve access. \"As Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger pushed legislation that would force counties to expand polling locations and directly address these issues,\" Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs said in an email.\n\"Unfortunately, every single Democratic Senator and Representative voted against this proposal saying that it would cause 'confusion.' Georgia voters deserve to know who is actually holding back progress and it isn't the Secretary of State's Office.\"\nDemocrats and voting rights groups said they opposed the Raffensperger-backed bill because they believed it weakened state election supervision and made it harder for people to vote. The proposal shifted even more responsibility for elections from the state to counties, \"without the necessary training, funding or support,\" Lauren Groh-Wargo, chief executive of Fair Fight, a voting rights group founded by former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, said at the time.\nA History Of Discrimination\nGeorgia's history of voting violations stretches back more than a century, with poll taxes, literacy and citizenship tests, and intimidation that disenfranchised many Black citizens.\nUnder the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Georgia and eight other states with histories of discrimination were required to seek federal approval before making changes such as eliminating polling places in Black neighborhoods or shifting polling locations at the last minute. Dozens of counties and townships in six more states also had to seek approval.\nThen in 2013, in a case brought by Shelby County, Ala., the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the method for determining which jurisdictions had to seek approval, saying it was unconstitutional because it was outdated. The court suggested that Congress could pass new guidelines, but lawmakers have been unable to reach agreement, leaving the pre-clearance requirement unenforceable.\nJones, the Morehouse professor, said the recent changes would clearly have required federal approval if not for the Shelby decision.\n\"All of these kinds of exercises ... would have had to be considered by the Department of Justice  or would not have been suggested because it would have been clear that the Department of Justice would have dinged them,\" she said. \"And part of that has to do with the importance of Black voters, particularly in the Democratic Party.\"\nExacerbating Shelby's impact in Georgia was an explosion in voter registrations. Thanks in part to the state's \"motor voter\" law that updates records whenever a voter interacts with the Department of Driver Services, the state's voter rolls have swelled by a third since the 2012 presidential election. In two metro Atlanta counties, Gwinnett and Henry, the voting population shifted from majority white to majority nonwhite, contributing to Georgia's transition from red state to purple.\nAs the number of voters was swelling, county officials across the state began a steady stream of closures of polling locations.\nBy June 2020, Georgia voters had 331 fewer polling places than in November 2012, a 13% reduction. Because of added pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, metro Atlanta alone had lost 82 voting locations by the time June's primary rolled around. Nearly half of the state's 159 counties had closed at least one polling place since 2012.\nFulton County, which includes Atlanta, and DeKalb County realigned dozens of precincts after some municipalities were annexed or newly established. Other counties cited changes in voter behavior, or tight budgets, but the Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica analysis found only nominal savings.\nIn Union City, about 20 minutes southwest of Atlanta in Fulton County, the number of active voters has grown about 60% since 2012.\nThree polls were open for the June primary, with 9,000 voters assigned to the Christian City Welcome Center. Two additional polling places are being set up for Nov. 3, including one that will reduce the burden on the Welcome Center. Three others, however, will still have more than 5,000 voters each.\nIn a September county elections board meeting, Fulton officials said the goal had been to add more polling places in 2020 to accommodate population growth. The coronavirus pandemic resulted in closures or relocations, but most sites have been reopened.\nUrban Congestion At The Polls\nThe influx of voters meant that already overburdened polling places got even busier.\nStatewide, the number of voters served by the average polling place rose 47%, from 2,046 voters in 2012 to 3,003 as of Oct. 9, according to the analysis. Some rural counties have as many as 22,000 voters assigned to a single polling place.\nForsyth County, one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, has grown its voter rolls by nearly 60%  or 60,000 voters  in the last eight years. Forsyth, a mostly white county about 45 minutes' drive north of Atlanta, now averages about 8,000 voters per polling place. Officials cut nine of its 25 polling places in 2013 and another after the 2016 election but added back five locations in 2019. No additional sites are expected to be opened for the November election.\nFulton County added nearly a quarter-million voters while consolidating voting locations. When the coronavirus struck, the last-minute unavailability of two polling places forced the assignment of 16,000 people to vote in June at Park Tavern, a restaurant/event space that reported 350 voters in line before the first vote was cast.\nSix of Gwinnett County's seven most congested polling places serve predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods. In Lawrenceville, home to one of the largest Black populations in the county, a judge ordered polls at the Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources to stay open late during the primary for the nearly 7,000 voters assigned there. It was one of 16 polling locations with missing voting machines on the morning of the primary election.\nAngela Maddox, a health care worker, cast her ballot there for the Aug. 11 primary runoff, when only local rather than statewide races were on the ballot. She said she was grateful that equipment was in place and low turnout meant no lines. The reports of voters waiting six hours or more in the primary were \"disgusting,\" she said.\n\"I know it's a big problem and it seems to continuously happen in Black communities,\" she said. \"That's where you tend to see a lot of the machines breaking down, or fewer machines, or any and everything to not count our vote, which is not fair.\"\nGwinnett County officials obtained federal approval in 2010  before the Shelby decision  to reduce the number of polls from 163 to 156, citing cost savings and operational efficiency. Since then, the county has kept the same number of polling places while adding more than 175,000 active voters. The average polling place handled 3,649 voters in the June primary and is set for 3,719 for November.\nWho's To Blame?\nSince the Shelby decision, the Georgia State Election Board, chaired by Raffensperger, has been the primary body for investigating and potentially sanctioning counties found to have violated election laws and procedures.\nBut the election board has rarely investigated the sort of violations that the U.S. Department of Justice once stepped in to review under the Voting Rights Act.\nSince 2010, when Kemp began his eight-year stint as secretary of state, the board has heard hundreds of cases, citing individuals for such violations as wearing political gear to the polls, and rebuking counties for mishandling voter registrations or absentee ballots. But it has taken no action to examine the poll closures that have been approved post-Shelby and has allowed a backlog of dozens of complaints to accumulate. In 2015, Kemp's office sent the letter to county elections officials that included advice on closing polling places.\nIn September, with Georgia in the national spotlight over its handling of elections, the board cleared a backlog of nearly 100 outstanding cases dating back to 2014 and referred several to the attorney general's office for further review. Among those was Fulton County's alleged mishandling of the June primary. The attorney general's office is still investigating.\nIn early October, the secretary of state's office told four counties  Fulton, DeKalb and Gwinnett in the metro Atlanta area and Chatham County in southeast Georgia  that had long lines, absentee ballot problems and late opening or closing polls in the primary to avoid a repeat by providing weekly updates on poll worker training, polling places and line management plans.\nBesides the board's actions, the Georgia Senate considered a proposal filed in February and endorsed by Raffensperger. It would have required county elections supervisors to add more equipment or poll workers, or split up any precincts with more than 2,000 voters, if there was a wait longer than an hour measured at three points on Election Day.\nMore than 1,500 of Georgia's 2,655 precincts have at least 2,000 voters  many of them in urban Democratic counties  and Raffensperger said at the time that voters should never have to wait more than 30 minutes.\nBut the bill, SB 463, was opposed by Democratic lawmakers and voting rights groups, who argued that any revamping in an election year would cause confusion and create more ways to keep people from casting their ballot.\n\"Do you have any concerns about trying to change the rules of the game in the middle of an election cycle when we have so much litigation that is currently pending with respect to the state's handling of previous elections?\" state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat from Atlanta, asked during the floor debate.\nThe bill originated in the state Senate, which approved it. The proposal then went to a state House of Representatives committee, where Republicans substituted a version that didn't address the polling place issue and barred the secretary of state and county elections officials from sending absentee ballot applications to voters. Their redesign never reached a floor vote, eliminating any prospect of legislative changes in the 2020 session, which ended in June.\nThat same month, after the primary election, Raffensperger held a press conference in Fulton County outside Park Tavern, which had processed more voters than 96% of the state's polling places. Flanked by posters highlighting recent election woes, he urged local officials to add poll workers and voting locations while improving technical support and training.\n\"We know that we need a more diverse pool of voting locations to spread the load of voters that we are anticipating,\" Raffensperger said.\nNikema Williams, chair of Georgia's Democratic Party, said that while state officials took little or no action to stop widespread voting problems in nonwhite communities, local elections officials are also responsible, since they ultimately decide whether to close or open more voting sites.\n\"We added counties as a defendant in the [August] lawsuit because we want to make sure that we're getting this right,\" she said. \"And at the end of the day, what matters to us is that voters are not negatively impacted at any level of the electoral process.\"\nAlthough the judge chided Democratic officials for offering vague remedies and failing to provide sufficient evidence that long lines are likely in November, Phi Nguyen, litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said there is plenty of evidence in plain sight.\nNguyen's organization has challenged a number of Georgia election laws in court, including the \"exact match\" policy that blocks voter registrations that do not exactly match a state or federal database. AAAJA also filed a lawsuit that forced Gwinnett County to change its process for rejecting absentee ballots.\nShe said the metro Atlanta counties' election administrators have not kept up with the wave of newer, more diverse voters, increasing the chances of disenfranchisement.\nNguyen was a poll monitor at the Infinite Energy Center arena for the primary and did not leave until the final votes were cast, well after polls closed at 7 p.m.\n\"Georgia made national news because of the breakdown in our election systems,\" she said. \"Long lines are certainly an issue and they happen more often in under-resourced places, which tend to be where communities of color live.\"\nChanges Before Election Day\nSome counties in the metro Atlanta area have tried to increase polling locations before the November election.\nJust weeks before Nov. 3, Fulton County approved 91 new polling places, focusing on areas where the lines were longest for the June primary. Fourteen polling places  including two of the four polling places in Union City  will still have more than 5,000 voters assigned, but that's a sharp drop from the 60 sites that had more than 5,000 voters assigned for the primary election, said Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron.\n\"If you have fewer people assigned to a polling location, you have fewer people that are going to go to that location,\" he said. \"We had some polling places in June where we had 9,000-17,000 voters assigned to these locations, so what this does is it spreads everyone out amongst many more locations.\"\nThe more than 16,000 primary voters who were assigned to Park Tavern are now split among five polling places, ranging from fewer than 1,500 voters to nearly 5,500. Park Tavern will remain a polling site, with about 4,300 voters.\nBut widespread rejiggering of polling locations just weeks before a presidential election comes with its own risks. A 2018 study of North Carolina voters from Stanford University found that relocating polling places decreases turnout, especially for younger voters.\nFor now, Fulton County officials are hoping for an 80% early voting rate to minimize voter confusion and other problems on Election Day, when the nation's eyes will once again be on Georgia. And they have doubled the election budget to $34 million, purchasing two mobile voting buses as polling sites to alleviate early lines and launching a massive outreach campaign to change voter behavior.\nThere are more than 30 early voting locations, including a mega-voting site at Atlanta's professional basketball arena equipped with 60 check-in computers and 300 voting machines. On the first day of in-person early voting Monday, Oct. 12, officials recorded the second-highest single-day total in recent years. Statewide, a record 128,000 Georgians braved long lines that first day.\nStill, Kathy in Union City is worried that her vote won't be counted.\n\"When you look at the systemic issues that plague us as a society, oftentimes we're screaming but we're not being heard,\" she said. \"Historically, we have seen that services and resources for Black communities have always been very inadequate, and this is just an extension of that. ... How could there be such a huge disparity?\"",

Although the external check supports the existence of long queues leading to voting extending into the next day (confidence score of 8), it is important to note that the external evidence refers to a primary election, not a presidential election as the caption claims.  This discrepancy weakens the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy.\n\nThe visual evidence itself shows a queue of people, which is consistent with the idea of a voting line. However, there are no visual cues explicitly indicating a presidential election. The lack of clear visual identifiers for the type of election makes it challenging to definitively confirm or deny the caption's claim. \n\nThe internal check highlights the ambiguity surrounding the type of election. While the queue suggests voting activity, it doesn't definitively state it's a presidential election. The external check supports the concept of extended voting hours due to long lines, which aligns visually with the image. But the difference in the election type (primary versus presidential) is a significant mismatch.\n\nConsidering the discrepancies, we must carefully evaluate the evidence. The visual evidence supports a queue, aligned with both internal and external validation regarding prolonged voting lines. However, the caption's claim about a presidential election lacks direct visual support and contradicts the election type noted in the external check's source. Hence, while the image shows a queue of people possibly waiting to vote, the caption's specific claim regarding it being a presidential election remains unsubstantiated.\n\nIn conclusion, the caption is considered out of context because the external verification reveals a discrepancy in the type of election. While a queue of voters is consistent with the image and validation, the claim of a presidential election is not directly supported by the available evidence. Therefore, the 'OOC' is set to 'true' with a reduced confidence score reflecting the uncertainty.",

            "date": "2018-08-26T07:00:18",
            "content": "A refugee crisis is growing in Central America as tens of thousands of Nicaraguans pour into neighboring Costa Rica seeking safety from the political crisis at home.\nFor more than four months, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has responded forcefully to nationwide protests, which initially began in opposition to a hike in social security taxes and quickly erupted into a call for his resignation. More than 300 people have been killed, hundreds more disappeared and thousands have fled the country, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization in Managua.\nThe Organization of American States has condemned what it calls \"serious human rights violations\" perpetrated by Ortega's government and allied \"parapolice forces\" against protesters.\nLast month, police and armed militias stormed into a small central Nicaraguan town where Jos Murillo and his friend Freddy Mondragn guarded a blockade, a round-the-clock protest against President Ortega. Outmanned and out-armed, Murillo says their simple brick barricade quickly fell.\n\"The government had us already on their list, a long list of all those in town who supported the anti-government protests,\" says 54-year-old Murillo. He says a fellow protester from their town was arrested and told relatives to warn the others about the list.\n\"That's when the persecution began,\" adds Mondragn, who is 43. Both men, who worked in farming and construction, say they heard that masked men came looking for them at their homes. \"We fled into the mountains,\" he says.\n\"We survived up there for 15 days. It was harsh, very harsh, so we decided we had to keep moving and we came here,\" says Murillo.\nA week ago, along with five others from their town, the group walked for three days, crossed a river by boat, sneaked into Costa Rica and arrived in the small northern town of La Cruz.\nThey aren't alone. As many as 23,000 Nicaraguans have come seeking asylum in Costa Rica since anti-Ortega protests erupted across their country in mid-April, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The pace of refugees fleeing picked up greatly after Ortega launched a repressive crackdown on protesters in mid-July, killing hundreds and jailing thousands.\nThe U.N. refugee agency said, as of July 31, an average of 200 Nicaraguans are applying for asylum every day in Costa Rica and called on international support to aid the refugees.\nMurillo and Mondragn are staying in a tent shelter set up by migration authorities a mile and a half outside La Cruz. They want to claim asylum, but that requires getting to the capital San Jos, about 170 miles away by bus. The fare will cost about $10 each, which neither of them have.\nRelatives back in Nicaragua have wired some money, but at La Cruz's Western Union office, the cashier tells Murillo through a glass window that he can't give it to them. Murillo and Mondragn fled without a passport and neither have a Costa Rica-issued ID.\nMany Nicaraguans coming across the border have a family member already in Costa Rica, which has a history of taking in migrants. The International Organization for Migration estimates as many as half a million Nicaraguans live here. For those without a relative to stay with, the camp, able to shelter up to 2,000 people, is a lifeline.\nInside the expansive camp, set up in an empty lot, a group of Nicaraguans play dominoes on a picnic table placed in an outdoor kitchen. Across the dirt field are a dozen portable shower stalls, port-a-potties and a large stone basin to hand wash clothes.\nUriel Cruz is sitting out the domino game. He's trying to get a fire started in one of the wood-burning stoves to make some coffee. A skinny pipe is helping him fan the flames with some direct air.\nCruz, who is 46 and married with two sons, says he worked in his northern Nicaraguan town as a legal adviser to the mayor. After the protests began, he says, the city started taking half his paycheck to fund pro-government protests and pay the paramilitary fighters. After he complained to his employers, he was summoned to late-night meetings at city hall with unidentified armed men. The last time they called him in, he says, he didn't go.\n\"They were probably going to kill me or throw me in jail for being a terrorist,\" he says. Thousands have been jailed in recent weeks since President Ortega enacted a sweeping new law that critics charge criminalizes all types of protest. Punishment is up to 30 years in jail.\nFor now, some residents of La Cruz say they are happy to help out the refugees. Leonor Perea owns a seafood restaurant down the street from the refugee tent camp. Her specialty is a large bowl of fish soup.\n\"We should help them, they are our neighbors,\" says Perea, who's owned the restaurant for 42 years. But she says she hopes the authorities are properly vetting them to weed out any bad elements.\nBut some Costa Ricans' patience may be waning. Last weekend, protests broke out in a downtown San Jos park where many Nicaraguans congregate. A crowd holding Costa Rican flags and shouting \"Nicaraguans go home!\" clashed with residents supportive of the immigrants and refugees. Authorities arrested 44 people and seized machetes, knives, Molotov cocktails and a baseball bat, San Jos police told local media.\nCosta Rican President Carlos Alvarado responded to the violent outburst in the capital urging the country to avoid falling into \"provocations or hatred.\"\n\"Today we are receiving people in our country, some are wounded or at risk, others are persecuted. Due to their vulnerable situation they seek refuge or a peaceful place in our country,\" he said in a televised message.\nBut he also promised his government will screen the newcomers and deport any who threaten national security or break the law.\nBack at the tent shelter, Uriel Cruz says he hopes talks will resume between President Ortega and a coalition of civic and church leaders seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis and early elections for next year. But he's not optimistic.\nNeither are others in the camp. Some say they are willing to take up arms in order to return  a troubling sentiment given Nicaragua's history of bloodshed during the 1979 revolution and subsequent U.S.-backed Contra war that lasted more than a decade.\n\"We need international help to come in and remove Ortega,\" says Cruz. \"All we want is to go back home.\"",

            "content": "When I last visited Damascus in 2008, the historic Old City district was full of Western students learning Arabic. Before bloody conflicts engulfed them, both Damascus and the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, were favorites with foreigners seeking to learn Arabic.\nEight years ago, U.S. student Kara Francis told me that while she did have to field some questions about then-President George W. Bush, she never felt looked down on for being American.\n\"No, to the contrary, every time I tell a Syrian that I'm American, they just get really happy and excited,\" she said back then. \"And you know, they tell me that they don't like Bush, and I tell them that I don't either.\"\nIn November, I spent a week in Damascus and found things are different now. The foreign students are gone. Nearly six years of conflict have killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians and displaced millions more. The Obama administration has repeatedly called for President Bashar Assad to step down, and anti-American feelings are abundant.\nThat's in large part, Syrians say, because of the brutal devastation wrought by a war that neither Western powers, regional actors, Russia nor the U.N. seem willing or able to stop. Those hard feelings are reinforced daily by the preferred news outlets here  state-run television and RT, the Russian broadcaster that serves up a steady diet of negative stories about the U.S.\nDamascus still has places like Caf Rawda, a popular downtown hangout for intellectuals, artists and academics. It's known as a place to find unusually candid opinions  philosophical, political or otherwise  in a city where dissent can be uncovered and punished by the authorities with shocking speed.\nThose conversations are probably still taking place, but on this visit, I didn't get to hear them. Once the management learned of my presence, I was asked to leave  not for being a reporter, but for being an American reporter.\nAt another, smaller caf a few blocks away, I met Mohammad, who greeted me with the warmth and politeness I remember from eight years ago. He agreed to answer my questions if I didn't reveal his family name or where he works. In this tightly controlled state, even explaining what's wrong with American foreign policy requires permission.\nHe said anti-American feelings are stronger now, but it's not just the USA.\n\"Actually, we don't just hate America, it's all the Western powers, everyone standing back and watching Syria get consumed by war or adding to the killing for their own reasons,\" he said. \"We have no good feeling towards the American government, of course, after many years of bad policies. We watched Iraq crumble and never imagined it could happen here.\"\nEvery country has at least one national myth: America was the melting pot where immigrants came to build a new life. Many Syrians still like to think of their country as the moderate, pan-Arab peacemaker that strove to hold a fractious region together. Now people wonder if Syria can hold itself together.\nMohammad said the Syrians who are dying in their homes and in the ocean fleeing to Europe know what it would take to silence the guns  but it's out of their hands.\n\"To stop this war, everyone knows we need an agreement between Russia and America,\" he said  adding, perhaps a bit hopefully, \"If they agree, it will stop immediately.\"\nI got in touch with Mohammad again after Donald Trump's election as U.S. president to see what he thought.\nHe said the Syrian government will probably be happy with the election results, given Trump's oft-stated wish to get along with Russia. But he's not convinced it will bring peace. What if Trump and Putin agree, in Mohammad's words, to \"keep the Syrian fire pit burning?\"\nHe says a friend of his, a visual artist, is planning a new series of works. It will explore the theme of \"insanity taking over the world.\"",

            "content": "Preface\nBefore driving into northern Iraq, Dr. Azar Mirkhan changed from his Western clothes into the traditional dress of a Kurdish pesh merga warrior: a tightfitting short woolen jacket over his shirt, baggy pantaloons and a wide cummerbund. He also thought to bring along certain accessories. These included a combat knife, tucked neatly into the waist of his cummerbund, as well as sniper binoculars and a loaded .45 semiautomatic. Should matters turn particularly ticklish, an M-4 assault rifle lay within easy reach on the back seat, with extra clips in the foot well. The doctor shrugged. Its a bad neighborhood.\nOur destination that day in May 2015 was the place of Azars greatest sorrow, one that haunted him still. The previous year, ISIS gunmen had cut a murderous swath through northern Iraq, brushing away an Iraqi Army vastly greater in size, and then turning their attention to the Kurds. Azar had divined precisely where the ISIS killers were about to strike, knew that tens of thousands of civilians stood helpless in their path, but had been unable to get anyone to heed his warnings. In desperation, he had loaded up his car with guns and raced to the scene, only to come to a spot in the road where he saw he was just hours too late. It was obvious, Azar said, so obvious. But no one wanted to listen. On that day, we were returning to the place where the fabled Kurdish warriors of northern Iraq had been outmaneuvered and put to flight, where Dr. Azar Mirkhan had failed to avert a colossal tragedy  and where, for many more months to come, he would continue to battle ISIS.\nAzar is a practicing urologist, but even without the firepower and warrior get-up, the 41-year-old would exude the aura of a hunter. He walks with a curious loping gait that produces little sound, and in conversation has a tendency to tuck his chin and stare from beneath heavy-lidded eyes, rather as if he were sighting down a gun. With his prominent nose and jet black pompadour, he bears a passing resemblance to a young Johnny Cash.\nThe weaponry also complemented the doctors personal philosophy, as expressed in a scene from one of his favorite movies, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, when a bathing Eli Wallach is caught off guard by a man seeking to kill him. Rather than immediately shoot Wallach, the would-be assassin goes into a triumphant soliloquy, allowing Wallach to kill him first.\nWhen you have to shoot, shoot; dont talk, Azar quoted from the movie. That is us Kurds now. This is not the time to talk, but to shoot.\nAzar is one of six people whose lives are chronicled in these pages. The six are from different regions, different cities, different tribes, different families, but they share, along with millions of other people in and from the Middle East, an experience of profound unraveling. Their lives have been forever altered by upheavals that began in 2003 with the American invasion of Iraq, and then accelerated with the series of revolutions and insurrections that have collectively become known in the West as the Arab Spring. They continue today with the depredations of ISIS, with terrorist attacks and with failing states.\nFor each of these six people, the upheavals were crystallized by a specific, singular event. For Azar Mirkhan, it came on the road to Sinjar, when he saw that his worst fears had come true. For Laila Soueif in Egypt, it came when a young man separated from a sprinting mass of protesters to embrace her, and she thought she knew the revolution would succeed. For Majdi el-Mangoush in Libya, it came as he walked across a deadly no-mans-land and, overwhelmed by a sudden euphoria, felt free for the first time in his life. For Khulood al-Zaidi in Iraq, it came when, with just a few menacing words from a former friend, she finally understood that everything she had worked for was gone. For Majd Ibrahim in Syria, it came when, watching an interrogator search his cellphone for the identity of his controller, he knew his own execution was drawing nearer by the moment. For Wakaz Hassan in Iraq, a young man with no apparent interest in politics or religion, it came on the day ISIS gunmen showed up in his village and offered him a choice.\nAs disparate as those moments were, for each of these six people they represented a crossing over, passage to a place from which there will never be a return. Such changes, of course  multiplied by millions of lives  are also transforming their homelands, the greater Middle East and, by inevitable extension, the entire world.\nHistory never flows in a predictable way. It is always a result of seemingly random currents and incidents, the significance of which can be determined  or, more often, disputed  only in hindsight. But even accounting for historys capricious nature, the event credited with setting off the Arab Spring could hardly have been more improbable: the suicide by immolation of a poor Tunisian fruit-and-vegetable seller in protest over government harassment. By the time Mohamed Bouazizi succumbed to his injuries on Jan. 4, 2011, the protesters who initially took to Tunisias streets calling for economic reform were demanding the resignation of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the nations strongman president for 23 years. In subsequent days, those demonstrations grew in size and intensity  and then they jumped Tunisias border. By the end of January, anti-government protests had erupted in Algeria, Egypt, Oman and Jordan. That was only the beginning. By November, just 10 months after Bouazizis death, four longstanding Middle Eastern dictatorships had been toppled, a half-dozen other suddenly embattled governments had undergone shake-ups or had promised reforms, and anti-government demonstrations  some peaceful, others violent  had spread in an arc across the Arab world from Mauritania to Bahrain.\nAs a writer with long experience in the Middle East, I initially welcomed the convulsions of the Arab Spring  indeed, I believed they were long overdue. In the early 1970s, I traveled through the region as a young boy with my father, a journey that sparked both my fascination with Islam and my love of the desert. The Middle East was also the site of my first foray into journalism when, in the summer of 1983, I hopped on a plane to the embattled city Beirut in hopes of finding work as a stringer. Over the subsequent years, I embedded with a platoon of Israeli commandos conducting raids in the West Bank; dined with Janjaweed raiders in Darfur; interviewed the families of suicide bombers. Ultimately, I took a five-year hiatus from magazine journalism to write a book on the historical origins of the modern Middle East.\nIn my professional travels over the decades, I had found no other region to rival the Arab world in its utter stagnation. While Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya set a record for longevity in the Middle East with his 42-year dictatorship, it was not that different elsewhere; by 2011, any Egyptian younger than 41  and that was roughly 75 percent of the population  had only ever known two heads of state, while a Syrian of the same age had lived his or her entire life under the control of the father-and-son Assad dynasty. Along with political stasis, in many Arab nations most levers of economic power lay in the hands of small oligarchies or aristocratic families; for everyone else, about the only path to financial security was to wrangle a job within fantastically bloated public-sector bureaucracies, government agencies that were often themselves monuments to nepotism and corruption. While the sheer amount of money pouring into oil-rich, sparsely populated nations like Libya or Kuwait might allow for a degree of economic trickle-down prosperity, this was not the case in more populous but resource-poor nations like Egypt or Syria, where poverty and underemployment were severe and  given the ongoing regional population explosion  ever-worsening problems.\nI was heartened, in the Arab Springs early days, by the focus of the peoples wrath. One of the Arab worlds most prominent and debilitating features, I had long felt, was a culture of grievance that was defined less by what people aspired to than by what they opposed. They were anti-Zionist, anti-West, anti-imperialist. For generations, the regions dictators had been adroit at channeling public frustration toward these external enemies and away from their own misrule. But with the Arab Spring, that old playbook suddenly didnt work anymore. Instead, and for the first time on such a mass scale, the people of the Middle East were directing their rage squarely at the regimes themselves.\nThen it all went horribly wrong. By the summer of 2012, two of the freed nations  Libya and Yemen  were sliding into anarchy and factionalism, while the struggle against the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria had descended into vicious civil war. In Egypt the following summer, the nations first democratically elected government was overthrown by the military, a coup cheered on by many of the same young activists who took to the streets to demand democracy two years earlier. The only truly bright spot among the Arab Spring nations was the place where it started, Tunisia, but even there, terrorist attacks and feuding politicians were a constant threat to a fragile government. Amid the chaos, the remnants of Osama bin Ladens old outfit, Al Qaeda, gained a new lease on life, resurrected the war in Iraq and then spawned an even more severe and murderous offshoot: the Islamic State, or ISIS.\nWhy did it turn out this way? Why did a movement begun with such high promise go so terribly awry?\nThe scattershot nature of the Arab Spring makes it hard to provide a single answer. Some nations were radically transformed, even as others right next door were barely touched. Some of the nations in crisis were relatively wealthy (Libya), others crushingly poor (Yemen). Some countries with comparatively benign dictatorships (Tunisia) blew up along with some of the regions most brutal (Syria). The same range of political and economic disparity is seen in the nations that remained stable.\nYet one pattern does emerge, and it is striking. While most of the 22 nations that make up the Arab world have been buffeted to some degree by the Arab Spring, the six most profoundly affected  Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen  are all republics, rather than monarchies. And of these six, the three that have disintegrated so completely as to raise doubt that they will ever again exist as functioning states  Iraq, Syria and Libya  are all members of that small list of Arab countries created by Western imperial powers in the early 20th century. In each, little thought was given to national coherence, and even less to tribal or sectarian divisions. Certainly, these same internal divisions exist in many of the regions other republics, as well as in its monarchies, but it would seem undeniable that those two factors operating in concert  the lack of an intrinsic sense of national identity joined to a form of government that supplanted the traditional organizing principle of society  left Iraq, Syria and Libya especially vulnerable when the storms of change descended.\nIn fact, all but one of the six people profiled ahead are from these artificial states, and their individual stories are rooted in the larger story of how those nations came to be. The process began at the end of World War I, when two of the victorious allies, Britain and France, carved up the lands of the defeated Ottoman Empire between themselves as spoils of war. In Mesopotamia, the British joined together three largely autonomous Ottoman provinces and named it Iraq. The southernmost of these provinces was dominated by Shiite Arabs, the central by Sunni Arabs and the northernmost by non-Arab Kurds. To the west of Iraq, the European powers took the opposite approach, carving the vast lands of greater Syria into smaller, more manageable parcels. Falling under French rule was the smaller rump state of Syria  essentially the nation that exists today  and the coastal enclave of Lebanon, while the British took Palestine and Transjordan, a swath of southern Syria that would eventually become Israel and Jordan. Coming a bit later to the game, in 1934, Italy joined the three ancient North African regions that it had wrested from the Ottomans in 1912 to form the colony of Libya.\nTo maintain dominion over these fractious territories, the European powers adopted the same divide-and-conquer approach that served them so well in the colonization of sub-Saharan Africa. This consisted of empowering a local ethnic or religious minority to serve as their local administrators, confident that this minority would never rebel against their foreign overseers lest they be engulfed by the disenfranchised majority.\nThis was only the most overt level of the Europeans divide-and-conquer strategy, however, for just beneath the sectarian and regional divisions in these nations there lay extraordinarily complex tapestries of tribes and subtribes and clans, ancient social orders that remained the populations principal source of identification and allegiance. Much as the United States Army and white settlers did with Indian tribes in the conquest of the American West, so the British and French and Italians proved adept at pitting these groups against one another, bestowing favors  weapons or food or sinecures  to one faction in return for fighting another. The great difference, of course, is that in the American West, the settlers stayed and the tribal system was essentially destroyed. In the Arab world, the Europeans eventually left, but the sectarian and tribal schisms they fueled remained.\nSeen in this light, the 2011 suicide of Mohamed Bouazizi seems less the catalyst for the Arab Spring than a culmination of tensions and contradictions that had been simmering under the surface of Arab society for a long time. Indeed, throughout the Arab world, residents are far more likely to point to a different event, one that occurred eight years before Bouazizis death, as the moment when the process of disintegration began: the American invasion of Iraq. Many even point to a singular image that embodied that upheaval. It came on the afternoon of April 9, 2003, in the Firdos Square of downtown Baghdad, when, with the help of a winch and an American M88 armored recovery vehicle, a towering statue of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, was pulled to the ground.\nWhile today that image is remembered in the Arab world with resentment  the symbolism of this latest Western intervention in their region was quite inescapable  at the time it spurred something far more nuanced. For the first time in their lives, what Syrians and Libyans and other Arabs just as much as Iraqis saw was that a figure as seemingly immovable as Saddam Hussein could be cast aside, that the political and social paralysis that had so long held their collective lands might actually be broken. Not nearly so apparent was that these strongmen had actually exerted considerable energy to bind up their nations, and in their absence the ancient forces of tribalism and sectarianism would begin to exert their own centrifugal pull. Even less apparent was how these forces would both attract and repel the United States, damaging its power and prestige in the region to an extent from which it might never recover.\nAt least one man saw this quite clearly. For much of 2002, the Bush administration had laid the groundwork for the Iraq invasion by accusing Saddam Hussein of pursuing a weapons-of-mass-destruction program and obliquely linking him to the Sept. 11 attacks. In October 2002, six months before Firdos Square, I had a long interview with Muammar el-Qaddafi, and I asked him who would benefit if the Iraq invasion actually occurred. The Libyan dictator had a habit of theatrically pondering before answering my questions, but his reply to that one was instantaneous. Bin Laden, he said. There is no doubt about that. And Iraq could end up becoming the staging ground for Al Qaeda, because if the Saddam government collapses, it will be anarchy in Iraq. If that happens, actions against Americans will be considered jihad.\nBeginning in April 2015, the photographer Paolo Pellegrin and I embarked on a series of extended trips to the Middle East. Separately and as a writer-photographer team, we had covered an array of conflicts in the region over the previous 20 years, and our hope on this new set of journeys was to gain a greater understanding of the so-called Arab Spring and its generally grim aftermath. As the situation continued to deteriorate through 2015 and 2016, our travels expanded: to those islands in Greece bearing the brunt of the migrant exodus from Iraq and Syria; to the front lines in northern Iraq where the battle against ISIS was being most vigorously waged.\nWe have presented the results of this 16-month project in the form of six individual narratives, which, woven within the larger strands of history, aim to provide a tapestry of an Arab World in revolt.\nThe account is divided into five parts, which proceed chronologically as they alternate between our principal characters. Along with introducing several of these individuals, Part 1 focuses on three historical factors that are crucial to understanding the current crisis: the inherent instability of the Middle Easts artificial states; the precarious position in which U.S.-allied Arab governments have found themselves when compelled to pursue policies bitterly opposed by their own people; and American involvement in the de facto partitioning of Iraq 25 years ago, an event little remarked upon at the time  and barely more so since  that helped call into question the very legitimacy of the modern Arab nation-state. Part 2 is primarily devoted to the American invasion of Iraq, and to how it laid the groundwork for the Arab Spring revolts. In Part 3, the narrative quickens, as we follow the explosive outcome of those revolts as they occurred in Egypt, Libya and Syria. By Part 4, which chronicles the rise of ISIS, and Part 5, which tracks the resulting exodus from the region, we are squarely in the present, at the heart of the worlds gravest concern.\nI have tried to tell a human story, one that has its share of heroes, even some glimmers of hope. But what follows, ultimately, is a dark warning. Today the tragedy and violence of the Middle East have spilled from its banks, with nearly a million Syrians and Iraqis flooding into Europe to escape the wars in their homelands, and terrorist attacks in Dhaka, Paris and beyond. With the ISIS cause being invoked by mass murderers in San Bernardino and Orlando, the issues of immigration and terrorism have now become conjoined in many Americans minds, forming a key political flash point in the coming presidential election. In some sense, it is fitting that the crisis of the Arab world has its roots in the First World War, for like that war, it is a regional crisis that has come quickly and widely  with little seeming reason or logic  to influence events at every corner of the globe.",

The image clearly shows a teacher in what appears to be a classroom setting in Amman, Jordan, using a smartboard to conduct a lesson.  The Arabic script on the board and the overall setting strongly suggest a classroom in a region consistent with Amman, Jordan.  The teacher's attire and the appearance of the classroom also align with this interpretation. The high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong internal consistency.\n\nHowever, the external validation completely contradicts this. It states that external sources provide no information corroborating the caption's claim of a teacher giving an online lesson in Amman, Jordan related to distanced learning. The confidence score of 0 indicates a complete lack of external support for the caption.\n\nThis significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks necessitates a conservative assessment.  While the internal evidence is compelling, the absence of any external evidence renders the claim unverifiable. The image itself does not explicitly state that the lesson is 'online' although the technology suggests it could be streamed or recorded. The visual evidence is consistent with an in-person lesson using digital tools, rather than a solely online lesson. The lack of students present is also worth noting, this could be due to various reasons, including spacing requirements, different class schedules, or a blended learning approach.\n\nTherefore, the caption might be partially accurate in describing the setting and teacher's actions, but it is inaccurate in describing the lesson as strictly 'online'.  The external validation's lack of supporting evidence for the context ('distanced education') compels a final assessment of 'Out Of Context'.  A low confidence score reflects the uncertainty resulting from this disagreement. The discrepancy highlights the limitation of relying solely on visual analysis without complementary external verification, particularly in verifying claims about the type of lesson being conducted (online vs. in-person). The absence of students does not make it solely an online lesson.\n\nThe final conclusion is that, while the image shows a teacher giving a lesson in Amman, Jordan, there is insufficient evidence to support the assertion that it is an 'online lesson' within the context of distanced education, especially considering the contradictory external validation.  Thus, the caption is considered out-of-context, but with a low confidence score to indicate the uncertainty caused by the clashing internal and external evidence.",

David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\nBorder agents \"say youve got to pay attention to this  $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register.\nIs this number correct? Its more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\nWell start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\nAs a result, in this fact-check, well interpret McKinleys comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinleys office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\nHeres the most recent data on drug seizures  cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl  from Customs and Border Protection.\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriffs office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\nThats less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but its in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. Its unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\"\nOur ruling\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. Thats smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.",

The discrepancy between the high internal confidence and the complete lack of external evidence makes it highly probable that the caption, while internally consistent with the image, is out of context in a broader sense.

Internal validation, based solely on the image, reveals no information about Sri Lanka, hangmen, or want ads related to executions. The image shows a person reading a newspaper's classifieds section focusing on employment opportunities; no details about the death penalty or hangman recruitment are present. Therefore, the internal check results in a low confidence score (0) and a verdict of False. \n\nExternal validation acknowledges Sri Lanka's ongoing debate about capital punishment and the challenges of finding executioners. The claim's plausibility is strengthened by the fact that governments might face difficulties recruiting for such positions. However,  there's no widely available evidence definitively supporting the claim that Sri Lanka specifically used want ads for this purpose.  News reports about Sri Lanka's justice system might mention capital punishment but won't necessarily contain specific details about recruitment of executioners using classified ads. Therefore, the external check offers moderate confidence (8) but remains inconclusive about the caption's accuracy. \n\nThe significant discrepancy between internal (0 confidence) and external (8 confidence) checks stems from the limited information provided by the image compared to the broader context of Sri Lanka's political and judicial affairs.  The image offers no direct evidence supporting or refuting the caption's claim. The external check relies on circumstantial evidence and the plausibility of the claim itself.  Given the lack of visual support for the claim within the image, and the uncertainty in external verification (lacking definitive proof of the specific method used for hangman recruitment), the final result is that the caption is out of context (OOC:True).

At least 10 police officers were injured.\nDemonstrators threw rocks, flares, firebombs, paint and other objects at riot police who responded with repeated volleys of tear gas. Some protesters jumped over a fence and tried to scale the steps, but officers chased them back down. One man draped in a Greek flag attacked police with a large stick, while others swung big flags on wooden poles and struck officers.\nPeople attending the rally said large clouds of tear gas led many to abandon the protest. The square in front of parliament had nearly emptied out by early evening, though small groups of protesters continued to clashed with officers.\nGreece's parliament is expected to start a debate Monday on ratifying the deal and vote on it by Friday. Macedonia's parliament has already approved it, agreeing that the country would go by the name North Macedonia.\nMacedonia and Greece struck the deal in June to end a decades-long dispute over Macedonia's name, which Greece says harbors territorial claims on its northern province of the same name.\nProtesters are against the deal because they believe that any use of the name Macedonia in the neighboring country's name is a usurpation of ancient Greek heritage and implies territorial claims on Greece.\nA statement from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' office blamed \"extremist elements and members of Golden Dawn\" - an extreme-right, anti-immigrant party - for the clashes on Sunday.\n\"In our democracy, citizens' free expression is an inalienable right, even for those who want to abolish democracy ... It is also the duty and obligation of those of us who do believe not to allow them. Let's isolate and condemn them,\" the statement said.\nPolice said in a statement that officers had been attacked by \"organized groups of individuals with special ferocity, (using) rocks, iron bars, wooden clubs, firebombs etc. ... Police forces acted according to operational plans and orders, showed restraint and professionalism and, using the appropriate methods, repelled the attacks.\"\nProtest organizers said they hoped to attract more than 600,000 people. Police released an official estimate of 60,000.\nWhile organizers had said about 3,000 buses would travel from northern Greece alone, police said that a total of 327 had arrived from across the country Sunday afternoon.\nAmong the people who addressed the protest were former conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, a member of the Mount Athos monastic community and a Greek-American former politician, Chris Spirou, once a member of New Hampshire's House of Representatives.\nIn northern Greece, farmers temporarily blocked the highway leading to the Macedonian border in solidarity. It later reopened.\nAbout 300 anarchists staged a counter-demonstration Sunday. Police erected barriers to prevent clashes. After their otherwise peaceful rally, anarchists burned a car with official license plates.\n___\nCostas Kantouris contributed reporting from Thessaloniki, Greece.",

Because today the boss is Kabila,\" Mr Fayulu said.\n\"Mr Kabila cannot stay and make an arrangement with someone who will not have any power... Mr Tshisekedi knows himself that he did not win.\"\nMr Fayulu said he feared there would be violence if the electoral commission did not give the true figures \"polling station by polling station\" and that it was the right of all Congolese to demonstrate according to the law.\nHas there been any violence?\nThousands of supporters of Mr Tshisekedi took to the streets to celebrate but those who backed Mr Fayulu also came out in protest.\nViolent scenes were reported in Kikwit, where at least two policemen and two civilians were said to have been killed.\nThere were reports of several hundred students protesting against the result and being dispersed by tear gas in the town of Mbandaka.\nProtests were also reported in Kisangani but the south, where Mr Tshisekedi has broad support, was mainly celebrating.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all sides \"to refrain from violence\" and widespread unrest has not yet been reported.\nWhat was the result of the election?\nAccording to the National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Mr Tshisekedi received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election.\nThe full results were:\nFelix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes\nMartin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes\nEmmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes\nTurnout was reported to be 48%.\nWhat could happen next?\nCandidates must file any appeal to the constitutional court within 48 hours of the announcement of the provisional results.\nJudges will then have seven days to deliberate.\nConstitutional expert Jacques Ndjoli told the BBC there were three possible outcomes: the court could confirm Mr Tshisekedi's victory, order a recount, or cancel the results altogether and call fresh elections.",

            "content": "Prime Minister Theresa May is to officially notify the European Union next Wednesday that the UK is leaving.\nDowning Street said she would write a letter to the European Council, adding that it hoped negotiations on the terms of exit and future relations could then begin as quickly as possible.\nAn EU spokesman said it was \"ready and waiting\" for the letter.\nMrs May's spokesman also rejected reports an early election may be held, saying: \"It's not going to happen.\"\nUnder the Article 50 process, talks on the terms of exit and future relations are not allowed until the UK formally tells the EU it is leaving.\nIf all goes according to the two year negotiations allowed for in the official timetable, Brexit should happen in March 2019.\nSpeaking in Swansea on Monday, during the first of a series of visits around the UK before she triggers Article 50, Mrs May said she was intent on \"delivering on Brexit and getting the right deal\".\nLast year's referendum result, she added, \"was not just about leaving the EU\" but was a vote for a \"change in the way the country works\".\n\"Part of that is building a strong economy and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth and prosperity are felt across every part of the UK.\"\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the UK was now \"on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation\".\n\"The government is clear in its aims,\" he said. \"A deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe - a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union.\"\nIn response to the news, Mr Tusk tweeted, external: \"Within 48 hours of the UK triggering Article 50, I will present the draft Brexit guidelines to the EU27 Member States.\"\nMr Tusk has previously said he expects to call an extraordinary summit of the 27 other members within four to six weeks, to draw up a mandate for the European Commission's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Under this scenario, talks are likely to begin in earnest in May.\nSir Tim Barrow, the UK's most senior representative at the EU, said the 27 had had plenty of time to prepare for this moment and he expected them to set out their stall \"pretty quickly\".\n\"Our mandate is clear, it is to get on with it,\" he told MPs on the European Scrutiny Committee. \"There is a timetable that everyone has bought into it.\"\nMrs May said last year that she intended to notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by the end of March. The move was approved by Parliament two weeks ago when peers and MPs passed unchanged a bill giving the prime minister the authority to set the process in motion.\nEU leaders have said they want to conclude the talks within 18 months to allow the terms of the UK's exit to be ratified by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament, as well as approved by the necessary majority of EU states.\nMrs May has said MPs and peers will have a vote on the deal she negotiates but she has insisted the UK will leave anyway even if Parliament rejects it. The government has said it expects to secure a positive outcome but made clear there is a chance of there being no formal agreement with Mrs May saying no deal was better than a bad deal.\nAhead of Mrs May naming the date European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted in German newspaper Bild saying the UK may have to abandon hopes of getting a trade deal if it did not agree to the term offered by the EU.\nThese terms may include a 50bn \"divorce bill\" and Mr Juncker said Brexit could bring the remaining 27 members closer together: \"They will all see from the UK's example that leaving the EU is a bad idea.\"\nLabour's Keir Starmer said the opposition would hold the government to account throughout the process, claiming the prime minister had failed to provide certainty about her plans or prepare for the \"clear dangers\" of not reaching a deal at all.\nThe Scottish National Party's Europe spokesperson at Westminster, Stephen Gethins, said: \"Today's announcement... shatters beyond repair any notion or position that the Prime Minister is seeking a UK-wide agreement.\n\"For nine months since the EU referendum, there has been no attempt by the UK government to seek a meaningful discussion or agreement with the devolved administrations.\"\nLib Dem leader Tim Farron, who has called for the public to have their say on the terms of exit in a further referendum, said Mrs May's decision to rule out membership of the single market before negotiations began was proof she was pursuing an \"extreme and divisive\" Brexit.\n\"Leaving the single market was not on the ballot paper in the referendum, it is a political choice made by Theresa May,\" he said.\nLater this week, EU leaders will gather in Rome to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which established the European Economic Community - the initial forerunner to the EU.

The internal check correctly identifies all entities and their locations. The caption's alignment with the visual content is excellent, leading to a confidence score of 10.\n\nHowever, the external validation reveals a potential discrepancy. While the external check agrees that the image depicts Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street and acknowledges her role as Prime Minister during the relevant time, it points out a potential issue with the timeframe. The caption states the event took place in November, while external sources suggest the image might be related to her March Article 50 announcement.\n\nThe discrepancy in the month is significant.  The external check acknowledges that Theresa May made many public statements as Prime Minister, but the specific date is crucial for accurate context.  Without confirming the exact date through reliable sources that align with the image, we cannot definitively say the caption perfectly matches the context. Hence, the external check provides a slightly lower confidence score of 8.  This is primarily due to the uncertainty about the month mentioned in the caption.\n\nConsidering both checks, the internal validation provides strong support for the caption.  The visual evidence aligns with the caption's description of Theresa May at 10 Downing Street. However, the discrepancy in the month between the caption and the external knowledge introduces doubt regarding the precise context. This doubt is not about the identity of the person or the location, but about the exact time the photograph was taken.\n\nTo improve the certainty, additional information like the original source of the image and its metadata, such as the date and time the picture was taken, could help resolve this discrepancy.  Without additional evidence, the external check's uncertainty regarding the date of the statement outweighs the strong internal validation.  Therefore, while the image is likely of Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street, the precise timing mentioned in the caption remains uncertain, leading to the conclusion that the caption might be out of context, resulting in an OOC value of 'true'. The overall confidence score reflects this uncertainty and is set to 8, reflecting the stronger internal validation while acknowledging the external uncertainty.",

The surviving family members place her corpse on the car's roof rack, cover it with a tarp, and continue on. Upon reaching the nearest town, the family stops for a coffee and something to eat, leaving Granny's remains tied to the roof rack. They return to the parking lot to find their vehicle  and their dead relative  gone.\nLEGEND\nExamples:\n[Brunvand, 1981; collected 1963]\nThis story was told me by my cousin, who had heard it from a friend in Leeds, about a couple whom he knew, who went for a camping holiday in Spain with their car. They had taken his stepmother with them. She slept in a different tent to the others. On the morning that they struck [broke camp], they were very busy, and they didn't hear anything of her for a while, and then, when they went to her tent, they found she had died, and rigor had already set in. They were in a great state, and they didn't know what to do, but they decided to roll her up in the tent, and put her on top of the car, and go to the nearest town, and go to the consul and the police. So they did this, and went to the town, and then they felt very cold and miserable, and they hadn't had a proper breakfast. So they thought they'd get a cup of coffee to revive them, before they went in search of the consul. So they parked the car, and went to a small cafe, and had their cup of coffee, and then came back to look for the car. But it wasn't there. It had gone.\nSo they went home to England without the car or the stepmother. But the difficulty was, they couldn't prove [probate] her will.\n[Emrich, 1972]\nIt happened to a family friend as they were traveling across the desert to California. Within this station wagon there was a father, a mother and their children, and the mother-in-law who everyone called \"Grandma.\" And as they were going across the desert Grandma became sick and she died. Now they didn't want to alarm the children and they didn't want to leave Grandma out in the desert so the only place they had room for her where she  her smell wouldn't bother the children  was to strap her on top of the station wagon along with the baggage with a tarp over her, of course. And as they were traveling across the desert they kept looking for a town where they could deposit Grandma. They finally arrived in a small town in Arizona where they stopped at a filling station and they went in to report Grandma's death. And while they were within the filling station somebody stole the station wagon and when they went out  no station wagon and no Grandma! Well, it wasn't very funny even though it sounds like it because they have to wait seven years now to prove that Grandma is dead before they can collect any insurance. And they've never been able to find either the car or Grandma. This actually happened.\nThey couldn't leave Grandma out in the desert. Not only because  uh  it wasn't right to leave a body out in the desert but also for insurance and also to prove it wasn't murder and also to prove there was a body in any court proceedings.\n[Healey and Glanvill, 1996]\nThere was a family from Surrey who decided to spend their vacation in France, taking their elderly grandma with them. Granny spent all their stay complaining. Well, not quite all of it, because a little way into the holiday, she died on them.\nDeciding that the old woman would hate not to be buried in her beloved Blighty, the family set about returning her home, and, mindful of the customs and other problems they might face, they resolved to hide her. So they bought a cheap bit of carpet, and rolled the wrinkled little corpse up in it. Granny's body was by now too stiff to bend on to a car seat, so they had to strap her on the roof-rack. In this way she was driven across France for two days, through driving rain and baking sunshine, across the Channel by ferry, and finally all the way home.\nUnhappily, having made it back without a hitch, the family were devastated when, after a well-earned cuppa, they went outside to find the car stolen  carpet, Granny and all. And they were never recovered.\nVariations:\nEuropean versions of this tale concentrate on the difficulties and\ntensions involved in crossing international borders, while North American renditions rarely mention borders at all. The primary focus in American tales is the inconvenience of dear old gran's death.\nGranny is the usual family member to kick the bucket, but every now and then some other elderly relative is called to glory.\nWhy the dead grandmother has to be transported anywhere is one of the story's details which is up for grabs  she dies in a remote area lacking a police station or a convenient mortuary, she kicks off in a foreign country, necessitating bringing her back across a border, or she had often expressed a wish to be buried in the family plot back home.\nWrapped in a blanket, sleeping bag, rug, tent, or bit of canvas, Gran is tied onto the car's roof rack. (In one odd telling, she's packed in dry ice in the canoe being carried aloft.) No one ever thinks to stuff her into the trunk.\nThe surviving members of the family either stop at a restaurant for a much-needed break, or leave the car parked in front of a police station while they go to report the death. Upon return, either all the luggage and paraphernalia they were carrying (including Granny) have been made off with, or the vehicle itself is missing.\nOrigins: Antecedents exist in traditional folklore for this legend, but the \"dead granny\" tale we know as an urban legend reached its present form during or shortly after WWII. Upon occasion, it will turn up in the newspapers, passed along as an incident that really\nhappened.\nEuropean renditions generally end with the family's discovery of the theft, a detail possibly related to why the body is being transported in the first place (usually out of filial desire to do right by the departed by bringing her home for proper burial). North American tellings, however, often end with the realization that inability to produce the body will lead to difficulty collecting the inheritance. In those versions, the corpse was being carted around the countryside usually only out of desire to dump it at the first appropriate spot.\nUnlike the dead cat in the package legend, scant thought is given in this story to the thief's projected reaction upon discovering what he made off with. The focus stays upon the family's woes, first in having to transport the corpse, then in having to explain the theft to the authorities.\nFolklorists have advanced differing theories about what lies at the heart of this legend: fear of the dead (without a proper burial, Granny may return to haunt her offspring), disgust with the elderly (at least now she's not sitting in the car), and distrust of authorities (fear of customs and border officials). It might be much simpler than all that.\nThroughout the legend's numerous tellings, Granny is never once portrayed as loved and valued, someone whose loss is felt and indeed mourned. Those left to cope with her death treat her as a non-person  their major concern becomes what to do with the decaying body, not how to come to terms with the passing of someone deeply cared about. There's no sense of tears being shed; it's all bundle up the body and get rid of it. Even in the odd telling where mention is made of the family being thrown into a great state by the discovery of Granny's demise, the focus is on their shock at happening upon a death and having to deal with the question of what to do with a corpse, not upon their grief over the loss of a family member.\nFiguratively a burden to the family during her life, Granny becomes a literal burden in death. Once deceased, she is dealt with in a manner reflective of how nuclear families often deal with their elderly  she's distanced from the vital center of the family and stashed out of sight. In reality, aging parents might be consigned to an old folks home wherein they receive a once-a-month duty call; in legend, the \"burden\" is packaged up for neat disposal and placed among the other baggage.\nThe twist at the end of the North American versions becomes stunningly appropriate under that analysis  the theft of the body causes a delay in the probate of Granny's will. Only a body to them in death, Granny has her revenge upon her cold-hearted relatives  the lack of that very body keeps them from inheriting what they thought should by rights pass to them.\nBarbara \"granny naught\" Mikkelson\nLast updated: 25 March 2011\nSources:\nBrunvand, Jan Harold.

            "date": "2016-10-14T06:22:17",
            "content": "Claim:\nScientists have officially declared the Great Barrier Reef to be dead.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn October 11, 2016, Outside Magazine Online published a piece titled Obituary: Great Barrier Reef (25 Million BC2016), which used the obituary format as a vehicle to describe the perilously fragile state of the Great Barrier Reef  the world's largest coral reef system that lies off the coast of Queensland, Australia  in the face of increasing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidity. The obit opened with the statement that \"The Great Barrier Reef of Australia passed away in 2016 after a long illness. It was 25 million years old.\"\nThis bleak assessment was a response to a number of different reports describing the extent of a massive coral bleaching event from earlier in 2016. Coral bleaching, as defined by Australia's National Coral Bleaching Task Force:\noccurs when abnormal environmental conditions, like heightened sea temperatures cause corals to expel tiny photosynthetic algae, called zooxanthellae. The loss of these colourful algae causes the corals to turn white, and bleach. Bleached corals can recover if the temperature drops and zooxanthellae are able to recolonise them, otherwise the coral may die.\nIn March 2016, the Coral Bleaching task force, a joint effort between members of numerous educational and governmental research organizations, released a preliminary report that concluded that a section of the Great Barrier Reef was \"experiencing the worst mass bleaching event in its history\":\nAerial surveys of more than 500 coral reefs from Cairns to Papua New Guinea reveal that the most pristine section of the Great Barrier Reef is currently experiencing the worst, mass bleaching event in its history, with the overwhelming majority of reefs being ranked in the most severe bleaching category.\nIn May 2016, the Australian non-profit research group Climate Council also released a report that offered similar dire information:\nThe latest surveys indicate that 93% of the individual reefs in the GBR have suffered some degree of bleaching, with reefs in the north the most severely affected. Australias marine biodiversity, and the jobs and economic prosperity that the reef supports, is under grave threat.\nThis report also warned that similar events would be more frequent in the face of higher global temperatures:\nMoreover, climate change is very likely to make the extreme ocean temperatures that caused this years event occur every two years during March by 2034. Extreme coral bleaching will become the new normal unless serious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are achieved.\nAdding to this grim outlook, a survey of the extent and severity of coral bleaching between March and June 2016 conducted by the Australian Governments Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and released on 13 October 2016 found that:\n22 per cent of coral on the Reef died due to the worst mass bleaching event on record. Eighty-five per cent of this mortality occurred in the 600 kilometre stretch between the tip of Cape York and just north of Lizard Island. Overall, the area south of Cairns escaped significant mortality.\nWhile the threats to the Great Barrier Reef are well documented and not controversial amongst the scientific community, no scientist has actually proclaimed the reef (which, in reality, is a massive sprawling collection of organisms) to be \"officially dead\". It is also unclear what organization or individual would, like a doctor in an ER, have the authority to pronounce a massive ecological community \"officially dead.\"\"\nIn fact, scientists have expressed frustration with the virality of the Outside Magazine piece, arguing that it both misinforms the public and suggests that efforts made to reverse the damage to the reef are fruitless, as the Huffington Post observed:\nRussell Brainard, chief of the Coral Reef Ecosystem Program at NOAAs Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, told HuffPost he expects the article was meant to highlight the urgency of the situation. But those who dont know any better are going to take it at face value that the Great Barrier Reef is dead, he said.\nTerry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said that he was not impressed by the [articles] message that we should give up on the [Great Barrier Reef], or that it is already dead.\nIn the same Huffington Post report, Hughes noted that the Outside Magazine piece wasnt entirely accurate, either:\nAdditionally, Hughes said, the article is full of mistakes. It states that the Great Barrier Reef experienced its first mass-bleaching event in 1981. But Hughes said the first was in 1998. Additionally, the article mentions the winter of 199798, which of course would have been summer in the southern hemisphere.\nAbove all, Brainard and Hughes stressed the importance of optimism when it comes to facing such a global crisis. As Brainard wrote in a comment on Outside Magazines Facebook post, this sort of over-to-top story makes the situation much worse by conveying loss of hope rather than a need for global society to take actions to reverse these discouraging downward trends.",

There will be a day when a machine is invented to scan if it is the 'right time' for a woman to enter the temple.

The image clearly depicts a large gathering of people at what seems to be the Sabarimala Ayyappan temple in Kerala, India. The external check, while having a slightly lower confidence score (confidence_score = 8), supports the caption's claim.  The external source mentions events at the Sabarimala temple in November, aligning with the caption's timeframe. Although the external source focuses on protests by women students, it does not contradict the presence of devotees at the temple during the same period. The image itself doesn't offer direct evidence of a protest, but the presence of a large crowd in November is consistent with the period of increased temple activity.\n\nThe slight difference in confidence scores between the internal and external checks is primarily due to the external source's emphasis on a specific event (women's protest) which isn't explicitly shown in the image. However, the temporal and locational alignment makes it highly probable that the image depicts devotees at the Sabarimala temple in November, as stated in the caption. There is no visual evidence of tampering or misrepresentation.  The image visually supports the claim of a gathering at the specified temple during the indicated month. \n\nIn summary, both internal and external validation strongly suggest the caption is not out of context. The minor discrepancy in the focus of the external source doesn't invalidate the caption's main claim. The visual evidence is directly supportive, and no contradictions are found between visual and textual information. Therefore, it's highly likely the image accurately reflects the caption's description.",

She made reference to the metaphorical glass ceiling that she has now shattered. She referenced the long struggles of the women's rights movement. And she tipped her hat to her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders.\nThen it was on to the work at hand - wrapping Donald Trump's recent controversies around his neck and pitching him into the Hudson River.\nIf Mrs Clinton has run a joyless primary campaign, it has been in part because she's spent much of it nurturing her built-in advantages within the Democratic Party and playing not to lose. Last week, in a foreign policy speech in San Diego, she went on the attack. And Tuesday night, she continued the broadsides. It's a role that allows her to show considerably more energy and passion.\nEarlier in the evening, Mr Trump focused almost exclusively on economic issues. Gone were references to Muslim immigration bans or border walls. Instead he made an explicit pitch to Bernie Sanders supporters and other Americans disaffected by the current state of the US political system.\nIt was the kind of primary night speech that will be well received by Republicans politicians who have spent the last week in a cave or a coma.

It said it had seized the military bases in a \"pre-emptive strike\" following a breakdown in relations with Mr Abiy's government.\nMr Abiy responded by ordering air strikes and a ground offensive to oust the TPLF from power. He declared the operation over after the capture of the regional capital, Mekelle, at the end of November.\nHe rejected calls for mediation to end the conflict, saying Ethiopia would not accept foreign interference in its affairs.\nThe US said \"residual fighting\" was still taking place, and there was the risk of \"a long-running insurgency in Tigray that will destabilise northern Ethiopia and worsen ethnic tensions throughout the country\".\n\"That could not only put at risk US-endorsed democratic and other reforms by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed,\" the statement said.\n\"It could also exacerbate instability in neighbouring Somalia, from where Ethiopia has already withdrawn some of its peacekeeping forces, and even in Sudan, where the transitional government is already grappling with serious problems.\"",

However, the general knowledge of the event and the visual context shown in the image strongly support the caption's accuracy. There is no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization, and the visual details align with the internal and external findings. There are no discrepancies between the checks; both confirm the caption's general accuracy within the limits of available information. Therefore, the caption is considered accurate, with a high confidence score. The lack of absolute confirmation of the specific event lowers the overall confidence slightly, resulting in a confidence score of 9.

The two leaders held talks earlier on Thursday after a grand welcome for Mr Trump.\nChina will further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs, the Chinese foreign ministry said.\nDeals worth $250bn (190bn) have also been announced, although it is unclear how much of that figure includes past deals or potential future deals.\nBut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told journalists the deals were \"pretty small\" in terms of tackling the trade imbalance.\nTrump tried to cajole Xi on Pyongyang\nDiscussion on how to deal with North Korea's threats to the region has dominated Mr Trump's agenda, and China is Pyongyang's main economic supporter.\nMr Trump said China could fix the problem of North Korea's nuclear programme \"easily and quickly\".\nHe added: \"I am calling on [Mr Xi] to work very hard. I know one thing about your president. If he works on it hard, it'll get done.\"\nMr Xi, for his part, said both sides would \"continue to work towards\" fully implementing UN sanctions and \"enduring peace\" on the Korean peninsula.\nMr Trump has previously been more critical and tweeted in July that Beijing was doing \"NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk\".\nJust before his arrival in Beijing he urged China to sever ties with the North. Beijing has consistently said it is doing all it can.\nHe swerved away from blaming China for the trade deficit\n\"I don't blame China - after all, who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens... I give China great credit,\" said Mr Trump while addressing a room of business leaders.\nInstead, the US leader said previous US administrations were responsible for what he called \"a very unfair and one-sided\" trade relationship with China.\nMr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, though he has since rowed back on such rhetoric.\nMr Xi on Thursday promised \"healthy\" and \"balanced\" economic and trade relations.\nThe two leaders also said they would work together to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking. Mr Trump upheld the \"one China\" policy in his talks with Mr Xi, Xinhua state news agency reported.\nHe has poured praise on Xi\nSince arriving in Beijing, Mr Trump has been fulsome in his praise for the Chinese leader, saying at one point: \"You are a very special man.\"\nHe has also enthusiastically thanked Mr Xi for his hospitality in several tweets.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

But a White House official told reporters that he would \"tweet whatever he wants\".\nAs part of his Asia trip Mr Trump has already visited South Korea and Japan, and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines later in the week.\nBudding bromance\nBy BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing\nYou'd be forgiven for forgetting that the two men at the centre of this blossoming bromance are meant to be strategic rivals.\nAcross the negotiating table, Mr Trump held Mr Xi's gaze. \"My feeling towards you is incredibly warm,\" he said. It's a statement that in many other circumstances might lead the recipient to glance nervously in the direction of the exit. Mr Xi just smiled and nodded.\nAt the ceremony where US and Chinese businesses signed a number of deals, the US president appeared to have dropped his old China-bashing ways completely.\nHis \"I don't blame China\" declaration over the trade imbalance was met with an audible gasp.\nEven here, one year on and 6,000 miles from the US presidential campaign trail, the audience couldn't quite believe what they were hearing.\nWhat's Trump done so far in Asia?\nHe's warned North Korea to \"not try\" the US and the world.\nBut he also called on Pyongyang to \"come to the table\" for a disarmament deal.\nHe said Japan and South Korea will be buying US military equipment which could shoot down Pyongyang's missiles - the two countries said they are considering it.\nHe's also lashed out at \"unfair\" trade ties with Japan - while in Tokyo",

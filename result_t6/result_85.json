        "content": "In the midst of accusations of sexism and sexual harassment by aides on Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, the senator's former campaign manager acknowledged Wednesday that there had been \"a failure,\" and Sanders is promising to make sure the same problems do not emerge if he runs in 2020.\nOver the past week, alumni of Sanders' presidential campaign have stepped forward to allege inappropriate behavior and unfair treatment of women. Numerous individuals said that staff on the campaign had not taken a complaint about sexual harassment seriously and had treated women unfairly.\nOn Monday, Politico reported that former Sanders aides requested a meeting with the senator and his top political advisers to \"discuss the issue of sexual violence and harassment on the 2016 campaign, for the purpose of planning to mitigate the issue in the upcoming presidential cycle.\" The letter did not provide details of what was being alleged.\nTwo days later, the New York Times reported a specific instance in which a Latino outreach strategist for the campaign complained to a supervisor that she had been harassed by a campaign surrogate, but the issue was not appropriately addressed.\nErika Andiola was the press secretary for Latino outreach, then later the political director for Our Revolution, a progressive organization that spun off from the 2016 Sanders campaign.\nShe told NPR that she recalls a phone call in spring 2016 with senior officials on the Latino outreach team. The alleged case of sexual harassment first reported by The New York Times was brought up, as well as broader complaints about pay equity for women on the campaign.\nFemale staff members and interns also expressed concerns that they were being made to do unimportant work compared to their male counterparts.\nThe response to their concerns, Andiola said, was disappointing.\n\"I remember being very frustrated around that call,\" she said. \"They did not take the complaints seriously, at least in my perception.\"\nLucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman and a surrogate for the Sanders campaign during the 2016 presidential primary, said she was contemporaneously aware of these same allegations of \"misogyny\" during the campaign.\n\"There was essentially a cover-up\" when issues were raised, she told NPR.\nFlores added that sexism isn't an issue isolated to the Sanders campaign, saying it commonly occurs in campaigns.\n\"Frankly, I do think it's a little unfair ... that the attention and all of the conversation is including Bernie's name, because this isn't just something that's limited to Bernie's campaign,\" Flores said.\nResponding to allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment during the 2016 campaign, former Sanders presidential campaign manager Jeff Weaver acknowledged shortcomings during that period.\n\"Speaking generally about 2016, was it too male? Yes. Was it too white? Yes. Would this be a priority to remedy on any future campaign? Definitely, and we share deeply in the urgency to make the necessary changes,\" Weaver said in a statement, first provided to The Times. \"In 2016, as the size of our campaign exploded we made efforts to make it a positive experience for people. That there was a failure pains me very much.\"\nA Sanders aide told NPR that they intend to meet with those who signed the letter first reported by Politico.\nOn Wednesday, Sanders' team released the sexual harassment policy for their 2018 senatorial re-election campaign, which showed that a third-party hotline to report sexual harassment had been established. Andiola said that she was unaware of any such line during the 2016 campaign.\nThe 2018 Senate campaign also had a mandatory briefing for all staff about their \"zero-tolerance\" sexual harassment policy and required supervisors to report any complaint of harassment they received.\nAsked about the reports on Wednesday evening, Sanders issued an apology.\n\"I certainly apologize to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately, and of course, if I run, we will do better next time,\" Sanders said on CNN, stressing the steps that his 2018 senate re-election campaign had taken.\nPressed by host Anderson Cooper about whether he was aware of the allegations during the 2016 campaign, the U.S. senator from Vermont said he was not.\n\"I was a little bit busy running around the country, trying to make the case,\" Sanders responded.\nNPR Congressional Correspondent Scott Detrow contributed reporting.",

    "explanation": "The image shows Senator Bernie Sanders walking in what appears to be a government building, possibly on his way to a meeting.  The caption states that Senator Sanders plans to attend a portion of a meeting with former staff members from his 2016 presidential campaign who have raised concerns about sexism and harassment.  The internal check found the image consistent with the caption, noting the visual depiction of Sanders walking is compatible with him going to or from a meeting but does not directly confirm or refute the meeting's specifics. The internal check gives a confidence score of 10 and a true verdict.  The external check uses a news source that reports former Sanders aides requested a meeting with him and his top advisors to discuss sexism and harassment from the 2016 campaign. This aligns with the caption's core assertion about a meeting concerning sexism and harassment on the 2016 campaign.  The external check gives a confidence score of 8 and a true verdict. Although the source does not explicitly mention Sanders' planned attendance or the exact amount of time he would spend in the meeting, it provides a strong contextual foundation for the claim in the caption.  Both internal and external checks support the main elements of the caption: Sanders is involved in a meeting, and the topic relates to issues of sexism and harassment raised by former campaign staff members. There are no significant discrepancies. There is no evidence to suggest visual tampering or miscontextualization. The photo is consistent with the claim made in the caption in terms of the individual depicted and the general setting. The minor lack of specificity regarding the extent of Sandersâ€™ participation in the meeting (mentioned in the caption but not detailed in the source) doesn't negate the core accuracy.  The high confidence scores (10 from internal and 8 from external checks) reinforce the overall accuracy of the caption. Considering the visual consistency, the corroboration with the external source, and the high confidence scores, it is highly likely the caption is accurate, and thus deemed not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation support the caption's accuracy.  Internal validation focuses on the image's consistency with the claim of Sanders attending a meeting. External validation uses a news source supporting the existence of a meeting concerning the stated issues. The minor discrepancy in the exact extent of Sanders' meeting attendance does not outweigh the strong supporting evidence."

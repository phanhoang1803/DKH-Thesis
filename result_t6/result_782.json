While the image doesn't definitively show whether the booster seat is backless or not, the presence of a booster seat and the mention of the US in the caption makes it somewhat relevant.  There is uncertainty about the 'backless' aspect of the booster seat.",

It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows some relevance between the image and the caption, but with uncertainty regarding the type of booster seat. The external check definitively proves the caption is false, citing a debunked social media meme about a non-existent US ban on backless booster seats.  The discrepancy arises because the internal check relies solely on visual interpretation of the image, which is ambiguous, while the external check provides concrete evidence from a reliable source (Snopes) that directly contradicts the caption's claim.  The external validation is more robust and conclusive.  The image shows a child in a car seat that might be a backless booster, but there is no way to verify this from the image alone. The caption's claim is factually incorrect, making it completely out of context.  Therefore, the caption is deemed Out Of Context.",

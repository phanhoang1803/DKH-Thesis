        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\nOrigin\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\" This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City policy  commonly referred to as the global gag rule. The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot  unlike the global gag rule  be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that bodys sexual and reproductive health agency whose mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled.\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the domestic gag rule  a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. Organizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services, the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations. Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  President Joe Biden on Thursday rescinded a regulation that barred U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform or promote abortions. His decision, while expected, was cheered by abortion-choice advocates and some humanitarian groups and denounced by anti-abortion groups.\nThe move also included a restoration of American funding to the U.N. Population Fund and withdraws the U.S. from an international accord that promotes anti-abortion policies. The steps came just a week after he was inaugurated and fulfills a campaign pledge to reverse a policy that previous Republican presidents, including his immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, had instated immediately on taking office.\nThe policy  known as the Mexico City rule, after the place where it was first announced at an international population conference, or the global gag rule  has been a political ping-pong ball, bouncing back and forth between Republican and Democratic presidents since it was first enacted in 1985 during President Ronald Reagans second term.\nThese excessive conditions on foreign and development assistance undermine the United States efforts to advance gender equality globally by restricting our ability to support womens health and programs that prevent and respond to gender-based violence, Biden said in a memorandum to his Cabinet.\nThe expansion of the policy has also affected all other areas of global health assistance, limiting the United States ability to work with local partners around the world and inhibiting their efforts to confront serious health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others, he said. Such restrictions on global health assistance are particularly harmful in light of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAccompanying Bidens determination was a decision to restore funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which Trump had ended over its alleged support for forced abortions and sterilizations in China. The fund has denied those allegations. The year before Trump terminated the funding, the U.S. had provided $69 million to the UNFPA.\nIn addition, Biden directed the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw from the so-called Geneva Consensus, an October 2020 document signed by 34 countries that sought to promote anti-abortion policies and others deemed pro-family worldwide. The consensus had been co-sponsored by the U.S. and was signed by numerous nations critics consider to be undemocratic or authoritarian.\nCritics of Trumps policies say they had hurt womens reproductive health care and contributed to poverty worldwide. Supporters argue they are essential to preserve the sanctity of life.\nTrump had expanded the Mexico City rule to include nearly all federal health funding, but its effects were felt most abroad, where U.S. assistance can be an essential part of a countrys health care spending.\nAlthough supporters of the policy argue that the overall amount of U.S. health care aid was not affected, critics maintain it contributed to a rise in pregnancy-related complications as well other issues by forcing some clinics to reduce broader health services, including for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious diseases, if they wanted to retain funding.\nReaction to Bidens decision was swift and sharp, even before it was officially announced. Abortion-rights groups and Democratic lawmakers hailed it as key to improving womens lives, while anti-abortion groups denounced it as immoral and unnecessary.\nThe Global Gag Rule has had a sweeping effect on lifesaving health care in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world, said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is shameful that the Trump administration chose to not only implement but exponentially expand this ill-conceived policy to historic proportions.\nShe called it an important first step to restore access to family planning services and mitigate the damage caused by an administration that pursued this dangerous policy without regard for its impact.\nDoctors Without Borders, which has spoken out against the Mexico City policy, welcomed the move but said more must be done to address the global health care crisis.\nWhile we are relieved to see a halt to this dangerous policy, there is much more work to do to mitigate the damage we have witnessed. Rescinding the Global Gag Rule is just a first step, it said. Millions of women still dont have access to safe abortion care because of restrictive laws, cost, stigma, a lack of trained providers, or other unnecessary barriers, such as mandatory waiting periods or misleading information.\nAnti-abortion groups and lawmakers were equally as strident in their condemnation.\nU.S. foreign policy  and the foreign entities we fund with billions of dollars in grant money  should consistently affirm, care for, and tangibly assist women and children  including unborn baby girls and boys, said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who has been one of the most vocal abortion opponents in Congress.\nFunneling U.S. tax dollars to abortion groups overseas is an abhorrent practice that flies in the face of the unity Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promised to inspire, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which seeks to elect anti-abortion candidates to Congress and other offices.\nEchoing the comments of others, she blasted the Biden administration for once again allowing taxpayer money to fund abortions, maintaining the move was payback for a group of abortion industry giants that support the presidents campaign for president.\nPushing abortion on other nations is not compassion, it is ideological neo-colonization, said Lila Rose of Live Action, a national anti-abortion group. This decision is a dark day for our nation  it will lead to more deaths of more children and for that, Joe Biden should be ashamed.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation, based solely on the image, suggests a high probability (confidence score of 8) that the caption is accurate because it shows President Biden signing a document. However, this assessment is limited by the lack of information regarding the document's content and date. The external validation provides strong evidence (confidence score of 2) contradicting the caption's claim.  Sources indicate that while President Biden took actions affecting abortion funding policies, these did not result in the US directly funding abortions abroad. The Helms Amendment of 1973 prohibits this, requiring Congressional action rather than an executive order for any change.  The external sources also detail Biden's rescission of the Mexico City Policy, which restricted US foreign aid from being used to perform or promote abortions but did not authorize funding for abortions abroad. The discrepancy between internal and external validation arises from the image's inability to definitively reveal the document's content. The internal check relies on the probability that Biden is signing a relevant document, while the external check firmly refutes the claim's specifics.  Because of the higher confidence and detailed evidence provided by the external sources directly refuting the claim, the overall assessment leans toward the external validation. This concludes that the caption is out of context, given the absence of evidence in the image confirming the executive order's content and the definitive contradictory evidence from external sources. Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context, and the confidence score is low (2) due to this discrepancy and reliance primarily on external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation, based on image alone, suggests the caption is likely accurate but lacks definitive proof. External validation strongly refutes the caption's claim, citing existing legal restrictions and policy details.  The final assessment is that the caption is out of context due to the mismatch between visual evidence and verified information."

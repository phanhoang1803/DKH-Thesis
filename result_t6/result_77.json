        "content": "An old image showing Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn wearing t-shirts with President Donald Trumps name and face on them, with a post claiming that the two Hollywood stars are big Trump supporters, has resurfaced yet again.\nThe July 27, 2016, Facebook post shows a photo of the two walking arm in arm, with Russell wearing a shirt that says \"Ive jihad it.\" Under the slogan on the shirt is an image of Trump shooting a gun and the word \"ISIS\" inside a circle-backslash symbol, referring to the Islamic State militant group. Hawns shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse search of the image shows it to be doctored, and PolitiFact previously reported on this same photo in November 2018, rating it Pants on Fire.\nThe original photo was taken in September 2015, while the two actors were walking in Los Angeles, according to an article from PopSugar. The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russells shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts. A reverse image search found the photo to be doctored. We rate this Pants on Fire.",

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check, based solely on the image itself, confidently asserts that the image depicts Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wearing Donald Trump t-shirts.  It gives a confidence score of 10, indicating a high degree of certainty based on the visual information. However, this internal assessment is contradicted by the external validation check.  The external check, which incorporates fact-checking from reputable sources like Politifact and Snopes, definitively concludes that the image is fabricated. These sources provide strong evidence that the image has been digitally altered, adding the Trump-related imagery to t-shirts that originally featured different designs or were blank. The external check also achieves a perfect confidence score of 10, based on the rigorous investigation performed by these established fact-checking organizations. This discrepancy highlights the importance of corroborating visual evidence with reliable external sources. While the internal visual analysis might suggest a certain interpretation, the external verification conclusively demonstrates that this interpretation is incorrect due to image manipulation. This case emphasizes the potential for manipulated images to mislead based on superficial visual assessments alone. To ascertain the accuracy of any online image, it is vital to cross-reference visual observations with established fact-checking resources and other credible sources. Therefore, despite the high internal confidence score, the external validation's definitive evidence of digital manipulation outweighs the internal assessment.  The ultimate conclusion is that the caption is out of context because it describes an image that has been digitally altered.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows high confidence that the image depicts Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wearing Trump shirts.  External validation, however, strongly refutes this, showing that the image is a digitally fabricated falsehood. The external validation's evidence of image manipulation overrides the internal visual assessment."

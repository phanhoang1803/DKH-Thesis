        "content": "BBC thriller Killing Eve leads this year's Bafta TV Award nominations, with its stars Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer both up for best actress.\nThe show has five nominations for the main awards and nine for Bafta's Craft Awards, which were revealed together.\nBafta allowed the nominations despite the fact that its rules say shows must have been broadcast in the UK first.\nKilling Eve premiered in the US on BBC America last April, five months before it arrived on BBC One and the iPlayer.\nThe spy drama's other acting nominees are Fiona Shaw, who played spymaster Carolyn, and Kim Bodina, who was Villanelle's handler Konstantin. They are up for best supporting actress and supporting actor respectively.\nKilling Eve is also in the running for best drama series, while Phoebe Waller-Bridge is nominated for best drama writer.\nThe top Bafta TV nominees\nKilling Eve - 14\nA Very English Scandal - 12\nPatrick Melrose - 6\nBodyguard - 5\nThe Little Drummer Girl - 5\nMrs Wilson - 4\nMum - 4\nThe full list of Bafta TV Awards nominees\nKilling Eve's nominations were possible because Bafta bent its own eligibility criteria, which say shows \"must have had the worldwide premiere transmission in the UK\".\nA Bafta spokeswoman said: \"Bafta's television committee deems Killing Eve a British series. Killing Eve received 14 nominations, nine of which were eligible under Bafta's criteria, and five of which were deemed eligible by the TV committee due to the significant creative contribution from key UK talent throughout the production. The television committee is the arbiter of all eligibility.\"\nLondon-based author Luke Jennings, who wrote the books that Killing Eve was based on, said most of the show's creative team, cast and crew were homegrown, as was its sensibility.\n\"You couldn't have a more British show than Killing Eve,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"This was a wholly British production and British in conception. They've decided we are eligible and I'm very happy to go with that.\"\nThe second series is about to start in the US, and Jennings added: \"I'll take a jump and I'll say we're probably going to be seeing season three, yeah.\"\nBodyguard stars have differing fortunes\nBodyguard's Keeley Hawes will go up against Comer and Oh for best actress - but there was no room on the best actor list for her co-star Richard Madden.\nBodyguard is also up for best drama series, alongside BBC One's Informer, Sky Atlantic's Save Me and Killing Eve.\nHawes is in the running for two trophies after also receiving a best supporting actress nomination for Mrs Wilson.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

His co-star Ben Whishaw is up for best supporting actor.\nGrant's rivals for best actor are Benedict Cumberbatch for Patrick Melrose, Chance Perdomo for Killed By My Debt and Lucian Msamati for Kiri.\nBafta chairwoman Dame Pippa Harris told the Press Association some \"difficult\" decisions had been made because there were only four spots up for grabs on each shortlist.\nShe said: \"When you look at those four performances, it's very difficult to say 'Well, which one you would pull out in order to put Richard Madden in there?\"'\nThe unstoppable Ant and Dec\nElsewhere, Ant and Dec are up for best entertainment performance and entertainment programme for Saturday Night Takeaway. Declan Donnelly had to finish presenting last year's series on his own after Ant McPartlin's drink-drive arrest last March.\nAt last year's ceremony, Ant was missing when Dec accepted the entertainment programme prize for Britain's Got Talent.\nBGT is nominated for best entertainment programme alongside Takeaway again this year. Their heavyweight competitors are Strictly Come Dancing and Michael McIntyre's Big Show.\nAnd I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here - which Dec hosted with Holly Willoughby last year in Ant's absence - is up for the best reality and constructed factual prize.\nWho's up for the comedy awards?\nThis Country star Daisy May Cooper is in with a shot of winning the best female comedy performance award for the second year in a row.\nBut she'll face stiff competition from Jessica Hynes for There She Goes, Julia Davis for Sally4Ever and Lesley Manville for Mum.\nSally4Ever and Mum are also up for best scripted comedy, alongside Derry Girls and Stath Lets Flats - both Channel 4 shows.\nBut the Car Share finale didn't make it on to the list, with Peter Kay and Sian Gibson also missing out in the comedy performance categories.\nHowever, they are up for best comedy writing and the show is up for the must-see moment prize, which will be voted for by the public.\nOther notable nominations and snubs\nDocumentary Bros: After the Screaming Stops and Black Mirror's choose your own adventure-style film Bandersnatch are among the productions with three nominations.\nOn the best actress shortlist, Ruth Wilson is nominated for playing her own grandmother in Mrs Wilson.\nAs well as being nominated for Killing Eve, Jodie Comer's 15-minute BBC Four drama Bovril Pam - part of a series of eight short monologues written and performed by women - is up for the short-form award.\nThere was no nomination for Jodie Whittaker for her first season as the first female Doctor Who.\nGood Morning Britain has its first Bafta nominations - named twice in the best news coverage category for its special on knife crime and its exclusive interview with Meghan Markle's father.\nThere's no place for Emmerdale on the soap and continuing drama shortlist, despite the fact it has won the National TV Awards' serial drama prize for three years in a row. Instead, the Bafta list has last year's winner Casualty plus Coronation Street, EastEnders and Hollyoaks.\nThe main Bafta Television Awards will be handed out on 12 May at the Royal Festival Hall in London and the ceremony will be shown on BBC One.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence that the image depicts Sandra Oh accepting a Golden Globe for her role in \"Killing Eve.\"  The visual evidence strongly supports this: Sandra Oh is clearly holding a Golden Globe statuette, and her expression and the surrounding context strongly suggest an award ceremony. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy. The external sources consulted provide no evidence supporting the claim that Sandra Oh won a Golden Globe for \"Killing Eve.\"  Instead, the information points to her Bafta nomination for the same role. This major contradiction severely undermines the caption's accuracy.  The internal validation relies heavily on visual interpretation and contextual cues, lacking concrete external corroboration. While the image is internally consistent with the claim, the absence of external verification makes it highly unreliable. Therefore, the caption is judged to be out of context due to this critical discrepancy. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty introduced by the conflicting findings.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation completely refutes it. This conflict leads to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

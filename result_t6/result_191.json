Wat Prayurawongsawas is a real temple in Bangkok, making the location believable. However, without specific confirmation of the artist's existence and this particular installation, complete verification isn't possible.",
      "supporting_points": "- Thai art scene is known for unique and sometimes unconventional styles.\n- Porcelain is a common material in art.\n- The existence of Wat Prayurawongsawas temple in Bangkok is verifiable.\n- The theme of mortality and legacy ('What Will We Leave Behind') is common in art.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's accuracy, although neither provides definitive proof.  The internal check highlights the visual consistency between the image and the description: numerous small, skull-like objects (consistent with \"tiny porcelain skulls\"), a person in the background (possibly the artist), and a setting resembling a temple (consistent with \"Wat Prayurawongsawas temple in Bangkok\"). The confidence score of 8 reflects this strong internal consistency.  The external check adds a layer of plausibility by noting the prevalence of thought-provoking installations in Thai art, the common use of porcelain as an art material, and the verifiability of the temple's existence. However, the external check's lower confidence score of 7 reflects the absence of direct evidence confirming the artist's work and the specific installation.  The discrepancy between the confidence scores stems from the difference between visual evidence (strong internal consistency) and lack of conclusive external verification (absence of readily available documentation). The overall conclusion, however, leans towards accepting the caption as accurate due to the strong visual evidence and the lack of contradictory information from external sources.  Additional evidence would be needed to reach a higher confidence level.  There is no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with strong internal visual consistency and plausible external context.  However, the lack of definitive external confirmation of the specific artwork results in a slightly lower overall confidence score."

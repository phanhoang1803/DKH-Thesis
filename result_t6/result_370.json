George Floyd is not present in the image. The caption correctly identifies the presence of NYPD and the text on the shirts. However, it is inaccurate to say that the image mocks George Floyd. While the shirts may be seen as insensitive given the context of George Floyd's death, it is not possible to definitively state from the image alone that the shirts are intended as mockery.  Therefore, the entities are mostly correctly used.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows members of the NYPD wearing \"I Can Breathe\" shirts mocking the death of George Floyd.\nA photograph of a group of men wearing shirts saying \"I Can Breathe\" spread online between late May and early June 2020 after the death of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd while in custody of Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer. The shirts appear to be in a Comic Sans font, and those wearing them are holding up a sign supporting the New York Police Department, prompting Snopes readers to ask us if they were members of the NYPD.\nThe shirts would appear to be both a dark and flippant play on words stemming from one of the last statements uttered by Floyd before he died on May 25, which was \"I can't breathe.\"\nBut the image actually shows protesters from a demonstration in December 2014, months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of an NYPD officer, and more than five years before the death of George Floyd.\nIn July 2014, Garner died as a result of police officer Daniel Pantaleo placing him in a chokehold. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for protesters calling for an end to police killings of black people. In early December 2014, a grand jury found \"no reasonable cause\" to bring charges against Pantaleo, triggering protests. In July 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered that the case against Pantaleo be dropped, and a month later, Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD.\nAccording to one report from the 2014 demonstration, about 100 people gathered outside New York's City Hall in support of the NYPD on Dec. 19, while other reports said the number was closer to 50. The pro-NYPD gathering, organized by a group called Thank You NYPD, faced off against around 200 counter-protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Organizers from Thank You NYPD told The Village Voice that their group was not made up of police officers, but \"citizens who appreciate the safety that the NYPD provides our great city. Ten million people policed by 35,000 officers is one hell of a task to handle.\"\nAt the demonstration, the pro-NYPD protesters chanted \"Don't resist arrest\" when the anti-police brutality demonstrators chanted \"I can't breathe.\"\nA video from the protest, by ReasonTV, sets the scene:\nA 2014 report from Gawker included some of the shirt-wearer's perspectives. An attendee named Mike Stables had flown in from Colorado for the protest, bringing \"I Can Breathe\" T-shirts with him.\nWhile it is not clear whether many NYPD cops were part of the protests or wearing the shirts, a number of people close to the police were present. Some attendees included a retired NYPD detective and a mother of an NYPD officer. According to CBS, neither Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, nor police unions, endorsed the rally because of concerns about violence. Bratton expected a low turnout. Patrick Lynch, a police union leader, complained about the lack of support from New York City's mayor and his administration:\nPetulant police union leader Pat Lynch recently complained of the lack of support coming from City Hall: \"If they're not going to support us when we need 'em, we'll embarrass them when we can.\"\nIn the above video, a pro-NYPD protester at City Hall responded to a journalist's comment on how the police use force to defend themselves: \"They do it with force -- well, no, we're not allowed to use force.\"\nSteven W. Thrasher, a columnist and faculty member at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, reflected on his coverage of the December 2014 protest for Contexts. By his account, off-duty cops were indeed present:\nHere I was, being 'protected' by the NYPD on duty, surrounded by angry, white, retired and off-duty cops and their supporters. Who hated the press and, it seemed, Black people  and I was in the middle of them.\nAnother report from Gothamist relates an exchange between protesters, indicating more off-duty cops were present:\n\"Where's your badge?\" one woman asked a man on the police side.\n\"It's in my pocket!\" the man replied.\n\"Why don't you take it out?\"\n\"I don't have to, I'm not on duty, bitch!\"\n... \"My boss told me to behave myself tonight,\" said Scott, a police officer who works in Connecticut.\nIt is clear from multiple reports that off-duty cops were indeed present at the pro-police side of the rally, but we are still unable to determine if any of them were wearing the shirts saying \"I Can Breathe.\" We do know that these images are from a 2014 rally supporting the NYPD after the death of Garner, and not in response to the death of Floyd. We thus rate this image as \"Miscaptioned.\"",

While a photograph of individuals wearing \"I Can Breathe\" shirts at a pro-NYPD rally did circulate online, the image was from a 2014 demonstration following Eric Garner's death, not in response to George Floyd's death in 2020. The article states that the shirts were worn by protesters, not necessarily NYPD members, and that the event predates the death of George Floyd by several years.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that the image shows NYPD members mocking the death of George Floyd by wearing \"I Can Breathe\" shirts.  Internal validation shows that the image does depict three men wearing shirts with that phrase, two of whom are holding a NYPD sign. However, the caption's claim of mockery is subjective and cannot be definitively confirmed from the image alone. The internal check acknowledges this uncertainty, assigning a lower confidence score (10). External validation, using a Snopes article, strongly refutes the caption. The Snopes article provides evidence that the image is from a 2014 protest following the death of Eric Garner, years before George Floyd's death.  This significantly undermines the original caption's claim about the context and intent of the image. The Snopes article identifies the image as miscaptioned. Given that the external check has a higher confidence score (8) and directly contradicts the core claim of the news caption, we conclude that the caption is out of context. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks highlights the challenges of interpreting intent from visual evidence alone. While the internal check identifies factual elements correctly (the presence of \"I Can Breathe\" shirts and a NYPD sign), it struggles to reliably assess the subjective aspect of \"mocking.\" The external check provides crucial contextual information missing from the image and the initial interpretation. This additional context decisively demonstrates that the image's use in the original caption misrepresents the event and its timing, making the caption out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption's description of the image content but cannot confirm the claim of mockery. External validation, from a Snopes article, decisively refutes the caption's claim by providing evidence that the image is from a 2014 protest unrelated to George Floyd's death. The external evidence overrides the internal assessment due to its strong corroboration and contextual relevance. The caption is determined to be out of context."

        "content": "Technically, on election day Americans are not voting for the presidential candidates themselves, but 'electors', who pledge to vote for a particular candidate. In most cases the electors' names are not on the ballot.\nIn nearly every state, whoever wins the most votes also wins all of that state's electors - who take part in a process known as the 'electoral college'.\nEach state has a different number of electors based on the number of representatives and senators it has in Congress, which itself is decided by the size of its population.\nA large, populous state like California has 55 electors, whereas a large, sparsely populated state such as Montana has only three.\nTo win the election, a candidate must win an absolute majority of electors. There are 538 available in total, so 270 are needed to win.\nThe number of electors - or electoral college votes - won so far are the large numbers for each candidate shown in the bars at the top of the BBC's results pages.\nThe presidential race is usually decided in a few states which switch allegiance from election to election.\nThese are sometimes called battleground or swing states.\nThe swings are often down to changing demographics, or personal factors such as a candidate coming from that state or region.\nCapturing the electoral votes of just one or two of these states can be enough to tip a candidate over the 270 needed to win.\nThe BBC reports 'projections' made by the ABC news network.\nThese are projections of which candidate has won that state's electors and subsequent electoral college votes. The projections are based on exit polls and/or partial results.\nFor races that are not very close, ABC, along with other US networks, are likely to project a winner as soon as the polls close, based on exit poll data.\nFor closer races, the news networks will wait until there is more actual vote data. It can take hours or even all night.\nWhen a projection is made by ABC, our results desk in Washington will update the BBC's electoral college vote tally for each candidate.\nResult will be described as \"projected\" until enough votes have been counted to know for certain.\nAll other election data, including popular votes and Congressional results, is provided by the Associated Press (AP).\nThe BBC receives this information from an electronic feed and uses it to compile running totals of popular votes state by state and nationwide.\nAP is the sole organisation responsible for providing results for the major American media networks.\nThe information they provide will form the basis for election results, but different broadcasters may decide to interpret partial results in different ways.\nIf a projection is not immediate, it does not mean it is too close to call, rather it may simply be too early to call because the networks have insufficient data.\nUnlike other states, Maine and Nebraska can split their electoral votes among the candidates.\nBoth states give two votes to the winner of the state-wide popular vote. The remaining votes are awarded to the candidate who has won most votes in each congressional district within the state.\nNebraska has three congressional districts and five electoral college votes, while Maine has two congressional districts and four electoral college votes.\nIn practice this has only happened once.\nIn 2008 Barack Obama was awarded one electoral vote in Nebraska after defeating John McCain in the 2nd congressional district.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies Donald Trump in the image and acknowledges the caption's claim is not directly verifiable from the image. However, it gives a high confidence score (10) despite this limitation. The external check, conversely, finds no evidence supporting the caption's claim and gives a confidence score of 0. This significant discrepancy necessitates a low overall confidence score. The caption claims Trump signed an executive order declaring himself the winner of the popular vote.  This is a factually false statement and is not supported by any credible news sources or official records.  The image itself shows Trump speaking, but provides no information about the context of his speech or any actions he may have taken. There is no visual evidence in the image to support the claim made in the caption. The internal check's high confidence score is unwarranted given the lack of visual evidence supporting the claim. The discrepancy arises from a mismatch between what the image shows (Trump speaking) and what the caption claims (signing a specific executive order). The internal check focuses only on entity recognition (identifying Trump) without analyzing the context or verifying the claim. The external check correctly points out the falsehood of the claim.  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably out of context, and the high confidence score given by the internal check is deemed unreliable in this case. The final assessment concludes the caption is out of context and has a very low confidence score.",

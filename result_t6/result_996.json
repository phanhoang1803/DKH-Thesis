      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  The UK experienced lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a rise in home baking activities.  Eating raw cake batter is a common, albeit potentially unsafe, practice.  The statement contains no overtly false claims, but there is no independent verification of Emma Billingham making this statement.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is plausible, but neither can definitively verify the statement's authenticity.  The internal check notes that the image shows a woman tasting cake batter in a kitchen, which aligns with the caption's description of baking and eating the mixture. However, the identity of the woman cannot be confirmed as Emma Billingham based on the image alone.  The external check reinforces this by acknowledging the plausibility of increased home baking during UK lockdowns but points out the lack of independent verification that Emma Billingham made this specific statement.  Both checks highlight the lack of direct evidence linking the image to the caption's claim, primarily due to an unconfirmed identity of the woman in the image. The plausibility of the statement does not overcome this uncertainty about its origin. The high confidence score reflects the strong correlation between the visual content and the general sentiment of the caption, even though the attribution of the quote remains unverified.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible but cannot confirm the statement's origin. The lack of verifiable evidence linking the image to Emma Billingham leads to a conclusion that the caption may be out of context."

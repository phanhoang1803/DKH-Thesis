        "content": "Claim:\nA line from George Orwell's novel 1984 predicts the power of smartphones.\nIn June 2017, a quote, purportedly taken from George Orwell's novel 1984, spread widely online, forming the basis for several memes that presented it as a remarkable prediction of the power and ubiquitousness of smartphones.\nReviewing Robert Icke and Duncan MacMillan's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2017, the Australian news web site News.com called it a \"quote from the production\" and added:\nThe line is from one of the characters that works for the Government, otherwise known as Big Brother. He says: The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice whats happening.\nAnd in its review of the play, which came to New York's Broadway in July 2017, the Spectrum News NY1 TV channel also highlighted the quotation:\nPerhaps most terrifying of all is hearing O'Brien seeming to predict our current state of apathy, saying, \"The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what's happening.\" In 2017, \"1984\" resonates louder than ever.\nWhat neither of these reviews make clear, and what the many memes get wrong, is that these words weren't written by George Orwell in 1949, and do not appear in the novel 1984.\nDespite a thorough search of the 2016 Enrich Spot e-book edition of 1984, we were unable to find these lines in the original novel. However, they resemble a speech from the book, made by O'Brien, a member of \"the Party\" who works at the Ministry of Truth:\nThe proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.\nAt another point in the original novel, the protagonist Winston notes: \"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.\"\nThe earliest iteration of the quotation on Twitter dates to July 2014, during the play's second run at the Playhouse Theatre in London. (It was first staged in 2013). During the same run, a second tweet attributes the lines to the stage adaptation. However, soon afterwards, the quote began to be falsely attributed to the 1949 novel, rather than the 2014 theater adaptation.\nThe revival of the play in Australia and then New York during the summer of 2017 has led to a resurgence in social media posts and memes falsely attributing the line to George Orwell's 68-year-old novel.",

Snopes fact-check reveals that the quote widely circulated online originated from a 2014 theater adaptation, not the original 1949 novel.  The fact-check demonstrates that a thorough search of the novel did not find this quote, and that the quote's initial appearance was linked to the play's run in 2014. Therefore, the news caption is incorrect.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies George Orwell in the image, giving a true verdict based solely on the presence of Orwell in the image. However, the external check reveals a critical flaw in the news caption's claim.  The external check definitively shows that the quote attributed to Orwell's *1984* is not from the original novel, but rather a later theatrical adaptation. This discrepancy between the internal validation (which only assesses the presence of Orwell) and external fact-checking (which assesses the accuracy of the claim about the quote's origin) leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The external check, with its high confidence score of 10, and strong supporting evidence from Snopes, overrides the limited scope of the internal check.  There is no visual evidence in the provided image to support the claim about the smartphone prediction. The image is simply a portrait of George Orwell, offering no contextual clues regarding the specific quote or its relationship to smartphones. Therefore,  while the image shows Orwell, the caption's statement connecting a line from *1984* to smartphone prediction is false. The overall assessment takes a conservative approach, prioritizing external validation for factual accuracy over the limited internal evidence. The confidence score reflects the high certainty in the external verification's findings, which conclusively debunk the central claim of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of George Orwell, but external check definitively proves the news caption's claim about a quote from *1984* predicting smartphones is false. The external evidence is conclusive and overrides the limited internal verification. The caption is therefore out of context."

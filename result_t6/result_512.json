        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows police officers attempting to arrest an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\nAs protests erupted across the United States in May 2020 after the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers, the internet was flooded with videos and photographs showing the sometimes chaotic scene.\nWhile much of this media gave genuine glimpses of these protests, a number of miscaptioned pieces of footage also made their way into the mix. The following video, for instance, was viewed millions of times as it circulated along with the claim that it showed two officers in Minnesota attempting to arrest a black man only to find out that he was an FBI agent:\nThis video, however, does not show the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. On the contrary, this video reportedly shows a police \"encounter with [a] black male\" in Rochester, Minnesota, and is unrelated to the protests in 2020.\nThis video was originally posted to Instagram by @thisisnike1 on May 31:\nIts timing coincided with the Floyd protests, but the original post included a caption explaining that this incident had been filmed \"over a year\" ago and that it involved the Rochester Minnesota Police Department. The original caption made no mention of the person in this video being an FBI agent. A version posted to YouTube by this account identified the person simply as a \"black male\":\nSomethin been telling me to hold on to this video over a year now, ok. Some days we make it home or some days we make it 6 feet deep. Imagine getting killed at home, while jogging, playing, minding your own business or just damn breathing #BeingBlackInWhiteAmerica!! This incident happened a year ago. The Minnesota police department been corrupt. Cant even smoke a damn cigarette in peace.\nSoon after this video was posted, it was re-captioned and shared along with the claim that it showed the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. It's unclear where this rumor originated. The above-displayed video makes no mention of this person being an FBI agent and when his wallet is pulled out by the police officer it does not show an FBI badge.\nThis rumor may have started with @thisisnike1, the account that originally posted the video. A screenshot supposedly showing a deleted tweet shows a message from @thisisnike1 reading \"[he is an] FBI agent.\" This appears to have been a joke, however, as this account has retweeted a number of people explaining that this person was not actually an FBI agent:\nIn sum, this video was originally shared with a caption stating that this incident took place over a year earlier (i.e., in 2019, not 2020) and that it featured an encounter between police and an unidentified black male. There's nothing in the video or the original caption indicating that this person was an FBI agent.\nWe reached out to @thisisnike1 and will update this article if more information becomes available.",

      "explanation": "The claim in the news caption is directly contradicted by the evidence from Snopes.  Snopes explicitly states that the video does not show an FBI agent being arrested. The video depicts a police encounter with a Black male in Rochester, Minnesota, that occurred over a year before the 2020 George Floyd protests.  The claim that it shows an FBI agent's arrest is false, originating from a miscaptioned and potentially joking social media post.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The news caption claiming the video shows police officers arresting an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  The internal analysis reveals a significant discrepancy: the image shows a police interaction with a Black man, but provides no evidence of his identity as an FBI agent or a connection to the George Floyd protests. The caption's assertion is purely speculative, lacking visual support within the image itself. The confidence score for this internal analysis is 3, reflecting the absence of visual evidence supporting the claims.\n\nThe external validation strengthens this conclusion considerably.  The Snopes fact check directly contradicts the caption's narrative. Snopes confirms that the video depicts a police encounter in Rochester, Minnesota, unrelated to the 2020 George Floyd protests, occurring more than a year prior.  Furthermore, it explicitly states that the man involved is not an FBI agent. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check reflects the strong evidence provided by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking organization.  This external evidence provides conclusive proof against the caption's claims.\n\nThe combined analysis strongly suggests that the news caption is completely out of context. There is no overlap between the visual content, the internal analysis, and the verified facts from the external source. Both the internal and external findings consistently refute the caption's core assertion.  The high overall confidence score of 10 underscores the clear and consistent evidence countering the caption's claim.  The discrepancies between the caption and the facts are substantial, indicating a significant misrepresentation of the event captured in the video. The video depicts a routine police interaction that is mistakenly associated with an unrelated high-profile event, and a false identity is attributed to one of the individuals involved.\n\nTherefore, the final assessment confirms that the caption is entirely out of context,  with a high confidence level based on the lack of internal visual support for the claim and the robust external verification disproving it.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly reject the news caption's claim. Internal analysis finds no visual evidence to support the claim, while the external Snopes fact check directly contradicts it.  The discrepancies are substantial, leading to a high confidence conclusion that the caption is out of context."

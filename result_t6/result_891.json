        "content": "Claim:\nTed Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.\nOn 28 April 2017, a number of unreliable web sites began publishing stories reporting that rock musician and conservative icon Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident in Montana:\nTed Nugent, 70s rocker turned hunting guide and conservative icon, was shot and killed early this morning in a tragic hunting accident. While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check notes a clear discrepancy: the image shows Ted Nugent playing guitar, while the caption claims he was killed in a hunting accident. This visual contradiction is a significant indicator of an inaccurate caption.  The external check corroborates this, citing a source that explicitly debunks the death report as a hoax and confirms Nugent is alive. The source's strong evidence (Facebook live video, confirmation from spokeswoman) eliminates any uncertainty about the veracity of the death claim.  Both internal and external analyses converge to confirm the caption's falsity with high confidence.  There's no visual tampering or miscontextualization apparent in the provided image; the image accurately depicts Nugent playing a guitar. Combining the visual evidence, the internal analysis of the image and caption's mismatch, and the strong external evidence of the hoax debunking, the conclusion is inescapable: the caption is entirely out of context and falsely reports Nugent's death. There is no ambiguity or disagreement between internal and external checks; they independently and collaboratively support the conclusion that the caption is false.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows Nugent playing guitar, contradicting the caption's claim of his death in a hunting accident. External sources confirm that the death report was a hoax."

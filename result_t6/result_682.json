(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the pictured icebergs are a phenomenon encountered in Lake Michigan.  Both the internal and external validation checks decisively refute this claim. The internal check finds the caption inconsistent with the image because Lake Michigan is a freshwater lake, while icebergs originate from glaciers in saltwater environments.  This inconsistency is given a confidence score of 0. The external check strengthens this assessment, providing evidence that the icebergs in the image were actually photographed near Cape Town, South Africa, thousands of miles from Lake Michigan. The external validation gives a confidence score of 10, based on this verifiable information.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external validation processes; both indicate that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The visual evidence supports the external validation by showing icebergs with characteristics consistent with those found in saltwater environments, not freshwater lakes like Lake Michigan.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the findings; both the internal and external checks provide strong, consistent evidence to reject the caption's claim.  The consensus among all evidence sources is that the caption is fundamentally incorrect and the image has been misrepresented regarding its location.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly reject the caption's claim that the icebergs are from Lake Michigan.  The image's visual details and external sources definitively place the icebergs in a completely different location, indicating a case of misattribution or misrepresentation. There is no conflicting evidence."

        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump's son Eric said that Hispanic people should be sent back to Asia.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 20 May 2016, the entertainment web site Politicops published a fake news article reporting that Eric Trump said that his father (Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump) planned to send \"Hispanics\" \"back to Asia\" when he became president:\nTrump Junior continued, Like, for instance, I was very good at geography when I was in school. But, they dont know that. And thats just another example of how lazy the Hispanics are as a race. And the main reason why theyre so afraid of my dad is hes going to deport them back to Asia when he wins the election. Its a well-known fact that fear makes people to crazy things. Its made them come and try to suck up to me so Id help them get in my dads good graces. Yeah, good luck with that.\nMy father is not a stupid man, and I can tell you he didnt father a stupid son, either, Eric Trump added. And when he does deport all these lazy Hispanics back to Asia where they came from, hell be doing that for two reasons. The first one is obvious  we dont need lazy people in this country. The second is thats part of his plan of taking back American jobs from China. Thats why hell send most of the Hispanics back to the Chinese capital of Bangkok, which is where most American jobs are located at the moment.\nHowever, Eric Trump never said that his father would send Hispanics \"back to Asia.\" Politicops, like its sister site Newslo, is a \"hybrid\" web site that publishes a mixture of news and fiction:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nIn this case, Politicops started with a real comment that Eric Trump made on a radio show explaining how Hispanics \"couldn't wait\" for his father to become president:\nPeople often talk about Hispanics, Eric Trump said earlier this week on Irish radios RTE Radio1s \"Drivetime.\"\nYou know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me, Listen, I cant wait for your father to be president. Hes going to bring jobs back to the United States. Hes going to end the nonsense. Hes going to create good trade deals. Hes going to create better education. Hes going to create a better family structure.\nReaders of Politicops can find out which portion of the article is fake and which portion is real by clicking on the \"Show Facts / Hide Facts\" button included at the top of articles:",

    "explanation": "The provided caption, \"Donald Trump's son Eric said that Hispanic people should be sent back to Asia,\" is definitively false according to external fact-checking sources.  The internal check correctly identifies a lack of evidence within the image itself to support the claim. The image shows Donald Trump and what appears to be his son Eric, but it provides no information regarding any statements made by Eric Trump about Hispanic people or any other demographic group. The internal check acknowledges this limitation and assigns a confidence score of 0, reflecting the absence of supporting evidence within the image. \n\nThe external check, however, provides strong evidence contradicting the caption. A fact-check from Snopes.com explicitly labels the statement as false and details the origin of the claim in a fake news article. The fact-check demonstrates that the statement is a fabrication and never actually made by Eric Trump. The high confidence score (10) from the external check underscores the reliability and thoroughness of the Snopes fact-check, which offers strong evidence to refute the caption's claim. \n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks in that the caption is inaccurate. The image does not offer support for the caption, and the external fact-check clearly establishes the falsity of the claim. Because of this congruence and the strong external evidence, we can confidently conclude that the caption is out of context and is a fabrication. The discrepancies between the image and the caption, along with the definitive external refutation, leave no room for doubt regarding the caption's inaccuracy.  The final confidence score reflects the certainty provided by the reliable external source.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is false. The image lacks evidence supporting the claim, while external fact-checking definitively proves the statement to be a fabrication."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that President Trump touched the face of a veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy a handshake.  The evidence shows that while the photo is real, the man was not a veteran; he was born without arms. The caption's claim about Trump's motivation is not supported. The evidence only confirms the physical act of touching the face, not the intent.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 states that the man in the photo, Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr., was born without arms and is not a veteran.  While the photo shows Trump touching Stevenson's face, the source does not corroborate the claim about Trump's knowledge or intent.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives high confidence (score 10) to the caption's accuracy based on the visual evidence alone. It correctly identifies President Trump and the interaction with a person appearing to have lost both arms. The external validation, however, presents a significant challenge (score 2). The external sources reveal crucial information contradicting the caption's claim.  The man is not a veteran; he was born without arms.  The caption also suggests Trump's motivation as an empathetic gesture towards the inability to shake hands, a claim not supported by external evidence. While the photo is verified as real, the context given in the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  Therefore, the main conflict lies in the description of the individual and the assertion of President Trump's reasoning behind his action.  The internal check relies solely on the visual information present, without access to the backstory or identities. The external check provides crucial context that directly contradicts parts of the caption. There is no visual evidence to prove or disprove whether Trump knew the man was born without arms or the reasons behind his gesture.  The absence of that evidence in the visual image and the conflicting information in the external source create high uncertainty.  Thus, the final verdict leans towards the external evidence because it provides information not readily available in the image. The image is only a fragment of the event, leaving much room for assumptions that are not substantiated. Given the discrepancies, a conservative assessment is necessary, leading to a lower confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation gives high confidence based on the visual, while external validation reveals crucial factual inaccuracies. The man is not a veteran, and Trump's motivation cannot be verified. The caption is deemed out of context."

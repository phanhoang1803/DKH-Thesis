      "explanation": "The news caption claims that Facebook is issuing pop-up warnings about the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sharing Facebook data of Standing Rock protesters with the FBI under CISPA.  This claim is highly implausible. While DHS and the FBI might collect intelligence, the method described (Facebook pop-up warnings directly stating this data transfer under CISPA) lacks any verifiable evidence and is highly improbable.  Direct governmental access to private Facebook data in this manner would likely trigger major legal and public outcry, making such a covert operation unlikely. The claim is suspicious and needs strong external verification. CISPA (Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act), while controversial, did not grant such broad, direct access to Facebook data without judicial oversight or user consent.",
      "supporting_points": "- DHS and FBI intelligence gathering methods are generally not public.- Direct access to private Facebook data by government agencies usually requires warrants or legal processes. - Such a data transfer would likely face strong public opposition and legal challenges.- The description of Facebook issuing such a specific warning is unconventional.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that Facebook issued pop-up warnings about the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sharing Facebook data of Standing Rock protesters with the FBI under CISPA. Both internal and external checks found this claim implausible.  The image shows a protest at Standing Rock, but it contains no visual evidence of Facebook warnings, DHS involvement, or FBI activity.  The internal check highlighted the absence of visual evidence supporting the claim, while the external check noted the highly improbable nature of such a mass data transfer and the lack of verifiable evidence to support the claim. The external check also pointed out the legal and public implications of such an action, making it very unlikely. The claim about Facebook issuing pop-up warnings is unconventional, and the entire narrative in the caption lacks credible external verification. Therefore, there is a significant mismatch between the image content and the news caption's claim, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly suggest that the caption is out of context. The image shows a Standing Rock protest, but there's no visual evidence to support the caption's claims about Facebook warnings, DHS, or FBI involvement.  External verification confirms that the described data transfer method is improbable and lacks credible evidence."

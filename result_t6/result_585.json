(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check identifies the image as depicting an iceberg, but notes the caption's misidentification of the location as Lake Michigan.  This is corroborated and elaborated upon by the external check which provides evidence that while images of similarly striped icebergs exist, the claim of their presence in Lake Michigan is false. The external source explicitly traces the misinformation, showing how the photographs, initially correctly identified, were later falsely linked to Lake Michigan. The high confidence scores from both checks (1 and 10 respectively) further reinforce the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  There is no discrepancy between internal and external findings; rather, the external check provides substantial additional evidence supporting the internal assessment. The visual evidence in the image itself is consistent with the findings; the iceberg's appearance, scale, and overall context are not congruent with the characteristics of Lake Michigan, which is a freshwater lake known for different types of ice formations. Considering all available evidence, it is highly unlikely that the caption accurately reflects the image's content. The misattribution of the location is a clear case of misinformation.",

        "content": "The Egyptian government has announced plans to build a new capital to the east of the present one, Cairo.\nHousing Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the project would cost $45bn (30bn) and take five to seven years to complete.\nHe said the aim was to ease congestion and overpopulation in Cairo over the next 40 years.\nThe announcement was made at an investment conference that aims to revive the Egyptian economy.\nThe gathering, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, has attracted pledges worth $12bn (8bn) in aid and investment from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nMr Madbouly said the population of greater Cairo, estimated at about 18 million, was expected to double within 40 years.\nThe Egyptian parliament and its government departments and ministries, as well as foreign embassies, would move to the new metropolis, he said.\n\"We are talking about a world capital,\" he added.\nDevelopers say the new city - the name of which has not been revealed - would include almost 2,000 schools and colleges and more than 600 health care facilities. They say the project will create more than a million jobs.\nIt is planned to be built over 700 sq km (270 sq miles) and house about five million residents.\nThe new capital is as yet unnamed, but it sounds like an Egyptian version of Shangri La. It's being billed as a smart sustainable city, on a grand scale.\nIf and when it's completed - and that could take years - it will be about the size of Singapore, with an airport larger than Heathrow.\nThe idea is to lure Egyptians away from the chaotic sprawl of Cairo - where congestion and pollution seem as constant as the waters of the Nile.\nThe authorities say it will spark a renaissance in the economy. Perhaps, but many here recall other flagship projects - which stalled in the past. Egyptian bureaucracy can be as enduring as the pyramids.\nPresident Abdul Fattah al-Sisi can't afford this to fail. Without tangible economic progress there could be more unrest ahead.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows a high degree of confidence (confidence_score: 10) that the image aligns with the caption's description of a New Year's fireworks display in a major city, possibly Cairo. The visual elements strongly support this interpretation: fireworks, nighttime setting, and a large-scale event over water. However, the external check completely contradicts this assessment (confidence_score: 0), stating that there's no information about such a New Year's event in Cairo in the provided external resources.  This significant discrepancy necessitates a low overall confidence score. The lack of definitive external evidence to support the claim of the fireworks display being in Cairo on New Year's Eve weakens the credibility of the caption, despite the internal consistency.  Given the absence of external corroboration and the possibility of the image depicting a similar event in a different location, the caption is judged to be out of context.  The explanation in the external check provides a potential reason for the failure of finding supporting evidence; it suggests a focus on the announcement of a new capital city instead of on celebrations. This could mean that the New Year's celebrations information was simply not covered or not easily accessible in the sources consulted for the external check.  To improve the confidence score, additional external sources should be consulted to verify whether a major New Year's fireworks display took place in Cairo on the date specified in the caption. If such evidence is found, the overall assessment can be revised. Without such external validation, relying solely on the internal visual analysis is not sufficient to definitively confirm the location and event as described.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly suggests the image matches the caption description of a New Year's fireworks display in a large city. However, external validation fails to find corroborating evidence, creating a significant conflict. This discrepancy leads to a low confidence score and an 'out of context' assessment."

It purported that on her first full day in office, Harris had threatened that \"we will use federal law enforcement and the military\" against \"Trumpers ... [who] will beg me for a loaf of bread\":\nThese Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, its time to end this. They really dont get. We will block them in the courts, we will use federal law enforcement and the military. After Joe inflicts the death blow, Ill take the reigns [sic]. They will beg me for a loaf of bread.\nWe found no documentation that Harris said any such thing, however. Such controversial comments certainly would have been widely reported, yet a simple search turns up not a single related news account. Nor did any similar statement appear in Harris' social media accounts or in White House briefing room statements.\nThe meme claims the statement in question was made on Jan. 21, the first full day of the Biden-Harris administration, but Harris' recorded events that day were speaking briefly to the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting (during which she made no such comments) and participating in a call with World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHarris had delivered her first speech as vice president the day before, on Inauguration Day, but in that address she made no mention of former President Donald Trump or his supporters.\nBecause we could find no evidence whatsoever of this quotation's being legitimate, we rate this item \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "The provided image shows President Joe Biden signing documents at his desk in the Oval Office. The caption, however, claims that Vice President Kamala Harris threatened to use federal law enforcement and the military against \"Trumpers\" shortly after their inauguration.  This claim is directly contradicted by the image, which only depicts President Biden and contains no elements related to the alleged threat by Vice President Harris. The internal validation check correctly identifies this discrepancy, noting that the image focuses solely on Biden and lacks any visual connection to Harris's purported threat.  The external validation check further strengthens this assessment by citing a Snopes fact-check that definitively debunks the claim about Harris's statement.  Snopes finds no credible evidence to support the claim, stating that such a significant statement would have been widely reported, but no such reports exist.  Therefore, both the internal and external validations conclusively demonstrate that the caption is out of context. The image provides no visual support for the caption's claim and the external fact-check offers strong evidence contradicting the caption's assertion. There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image is an accurate representation of President Biden signing documents. The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement between the internal analysis of the image and the external fact-checking that confirms the caption's falsity.  There is no evidence to support the assertion made in the caption. The image displays a completely unrelated event. The internal and external validations are in complete agreement that the caption is false and out of context.  The analysis has thoroughly checked for inconsistencies and uncertainties.  There are no discrepancies between internal and external checks. The lack of any supporting evidence, coupled with the external fact-check's definitive debunking, makes the conclusion overwhelmingly clear.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows President Biden, while the caption describes a statement allegedly made by Vice President Harris.  External fact-checking definitively debunks the claim in the caption."

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's claim, although neither can definitively confirm that the photo was taken in Figuig on a specific Friday. The internal check notes that the image's architecture and clothing are consistent with a Moroccan setting, and that while Figuig's identity cannot be fully ascertained from the image alone, the likelihood is high given the overall context.  The external check confirms that Figuig is a real town in Morocco known for its distinctive architecture and oasis setting, making the caption's description of a woman walking through brightly painted buildings plausible. The statement that this event occurred on a Friday is also considered plausible, as it is a regular day of the week. However, both checks admit the limitations in verifying the precise time and date of the event depicted in the image.  The confidence score of 8 reflects this uncertainty, acknowledging the plausible scenario but highlighting the lack of definitive proof for the specifics of the day and location. Discrepancies are minimal; both checks agree on the general plausibility of the caption, despite the inability to definitively confirm the exact time and location. There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible, although they cannot definitively confirm the exact date and location due to the limitations of the visual evidence. The overall scene is consistent with a Moroccan town, and the specifics of the caption are not implausible, but cannot be fully verified."

    "explanation": "The provided caption, \"The FBI raided the CDC in the middle of the night to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism,\" is demonstrably false and completely out of context with the image. The image clearly shows the exterior of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) building.  There is no visual evidence whatsoever of an FBI raid, night-time activity, or any indication of data seizure.  The caption's claim is not merely unsupported by the image; it actively contradicts the serene, daytime scene depicted.\n\nThe internal validation check accurately reflects this discrepancy.  It correctly identifies the CDC building in the image but flags the FBI raid claim as unsupported and inaccurate.  The confidence score of 8 appropriately conveys the certainty that the caption's claim of an FBI raid is unsubstantiated based solely on the visual content.\n\nThe external validation check provides further confirmation.  It definitively states that the claim of an FBI raid on the CDC to seize data on a vaccine-autism link is factually incorrect. The check underscores the complete absence of credible evidence supporting this claim, identifying it as a debunked conspiracy theory. The fact that such a significant event would have been widely reported in the news further strengthens the external validation's conclusion. The high confidence score of 1 reinforces the certainty of this factual inaccuracy.\n\nThere is a perfect alignment between the internal and external validation results. Both independently and conclusively determine that the caption is entirely fabricated and bears no relation to the depicted image. The image shows the CDC building, while the caption introduces a false narrative about a non-existent event involving the FBI. No aspect of the caption is supported by the visual evidence.  The external check also provides additional context regarding the nature of the false claim (a debunked conspiracy theory), making the falsity even more certain.\n\nThere is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the assessment. The visual evidence strongly supports the internal validation, which is itself fully corroborated by the robust external validation. The combination of strong internal validation (8/10 confidence) and compelling external validation (1/10 confidence; though a higher confidence is appropriate in this case of a completely debunked claim) yields an overall confidence score of 10/10.  The absence of any supportive visual detail, the straightforward contradiction between image and text, and the irrefutable external evidence leave no room for doubt. The caption is categorically false and completely out of context with the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks decisively confirm that the caption is false and completely out of context with the image.  The image shows the CDC building; the caption falsely claims an FBI raid involving vaccine data.  There is no visual evidence supporting the caption's claims, and the external check confirms its factual inaccuracy as a debunked conspiracy theory."

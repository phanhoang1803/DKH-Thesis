        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton got her wish that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought.\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, its an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

Snopes rates this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it uses a fabricated quote attributed to Clinton.

    "explanation": "The internal check validates the image's content, confirming the presence of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.  However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, identifies the claim that Hillary Clinton wished for someone like Donald Trump to run for office as a fabrication, specifically citing a false quote attributed to Clinton. The external source discredits the caption's core assertion. While the image itself is genuine and accurately depicts the individuals mentioned, the caption's meaning is misleading and out of context according to external verification. The confidence score reflects the reliability of the external check and its strong evidence against the caption's accuracy.The image, while showing a picture of Clinton and Trump, does not inherently support the caption's narrative. There's no visual evidence within the image itself to suggest Clinton desired Trump's candidacy.  The image simply shows them together at an event; the claim requires additional contextual information that isn't supported by the image or credible external sources. The disagreement between internal and external checks arises because the internal check only assesses the image's visual content and the identity of those shown, not the claim made in the caption. The external check focuses on the validity of that claim and finds it to be false. Because the core assertion is false, the caption is determined to be out of context, despite the image's internal validity. In summary, the image itself is not manipulated and correctly shows both Clinton and Trump, but the caption adds a narrative that lacks factual basis and is debunked by external verification. This highlights the importance of considering both internal (visual verification) and external (fact-checking) aspects for a complete assessment of caption accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the presence of Clinton and Trump, but external validation (Snopes) debunks the claim that Clinton wished for someone like Trump to run for office, marking the caption as inaccurate and out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

    "explanation": "The provided image shows a man in Maasai attire. However, the image alone does not provide evidence to support the claim that he is whipping people for disobeying quarantine orders. The caption states that a video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya for violating self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The internal check notes that while the image shows a person visually appearing to be of Maasai tribe in Kenya, \"whipping people\" is not evident.  COVID-19 is also not visually present. The external check corroborates this by citing Snopes.com, which refutes the claim.  Snopes explains that the video is from a Kenyan comedian and not a government official.  While the article notes that the Kenyan government did use violent tactics, this differs from the specific claim about Maasai tribespeople whipping people.  Both the internal and external checks agree that the claim in the caption is not supported by the evidence.  The lack of visual evidence of whipping, along with the confirmation from Snopes that the video is not what the caption describes, makes the claim highly unreliable. The image shows only a single individual; it doesn't depict any act of violence or enforcement of quarantine orders. Therefore, the caption is out of context, and the confidence score is high due to the combined evidence from the visual analysis and the external fact-checking resource.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the news caption is out of context. The image lacks evidence of whipping, and external verification confirms the video's origin is unrelated to government-sanctioned actions."

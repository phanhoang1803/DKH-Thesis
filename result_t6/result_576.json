It was founded in 1919 to provide housing specifically for employees of Cadbury Brothers Ltd.\n\"This exhibition reflects on the life of those living and working in Bournville over the last 100 years - their work, activities, commercial developments and home life,\" said Bob Booth, chairman of the Bournville Society.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows high confidence (confidence score 10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content and metadata.  The image depicts a large crowd at a swimming pool, aligning with the caption's description of \"Large crowds.\" The metadata associated with the image confirms the location as Rowheath Lido and the year as 1937. However, the external validation yields low confidence (confidence score 3) and contradicts the caption's claim. The external source searched did not provide any information supporting the caption's assertion regarding the popularity of Rowheath Lido in 1937 or the presence of large crowds. This discrepancy creates a conflict between internal and external evidence.  Given the lack of external corroboration for the claim about the popularity and crowd size, despite the strong internal validation based on image content and metadata, the final assessment leans towards the caption being out of context. The confidence score is lowered to reflect this uncertainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption based on image content and metadata. However, external validation fails to find supporting evidence for the claim regarding the pool's popularity and crowd size in 1937.  This discrepancy lowers confidence in the caption's accuracy."

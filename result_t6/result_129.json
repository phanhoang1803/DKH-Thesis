        "content": "Claim:\nPilot Flying J is removing American flags from their truck stop flagpoles because the flags \"offend foreigners.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 5 May 2018, Facebook user Dave Moore uploaded a video from a Pilot Flying J truck stop in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that a flagless Flying J location it displayed was the result of the company's attempt to placate \"foreigners\" who would otherwise be offended by the sight of an American flag in the United States (for reasons he did not explicate):\nMoore described (but did not film) a interaction with an unspecified employee who, according to him, openly stated that non-American customers requested that the flag be removed: \"I went inside the Pilot and I asked them ... they said they had an issue with foreigners coming here and complaining, and they didn't want to lose the foreigners' business so they took it down.\"\nIn fact the clip did not corroborate his claim, despite being made directly in front of the Pilot Flying J where he claimed the interaction took place. Although he shot a video directly after the purported conversation, he apparently didn't capture evidence that it happened as described (or at all).\nGas stations are frequently targeted for rumors of insufficient patriotism and various versions of the \"Shunned Serviceman\" urban legend. Modern (mostly invented) repetitions of the such rumors have circulated in Illinois, on Long Island, and in Holly, Michigan.\nIn some e-mailed variations of this rumor which we received, readers asked if Pilot Flying J had announced that they would be removing all American flags, everywhere:\nPilot and Flying J truck stops announced they were taking down the American Flag. They started the American Flag was offensive to the foreign truck drivers. Well screw them I will not stop or use these truck stops or gas stations ever again. I cut up my Pilot rewards gas card.\nAs is often the case with claims about \"offensive\" American flags or unpatriotic gas stations, Moore's story spread quickly, accruing nearly three million views in under a week. One day after it was posted, Pilot Flying J addressed the rumor on social media, stating that the store in question lacked a U.S. flag because a damaged flagpole there was in the process of being repaired:\nIn their Facebook post, Pilot Flying J reported that a \"team member was misinformed,\" but the company did not provide any more detail about the nature of that misinformation.\nA public relations firm representing Flying J sent us a response to our inquiry about the issue which stated that:\nI want to re-iterate that the current policy is that an American flag can only be displayed at our locations if it can be flown according to military protocol. The flag at store #436 in Amarillo, TX was not being flown as the pole is broken and prevents the flag being flown according to protocol.\nWe apologize the store manager did not have this information. We are still investigating all the details behind this miscommunication, but what we can tell you is what the situation at hand truly is, and that we are working to fix the pole at this location and are currently surveying our locations with flag poles to review if they are in proper working condition.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch between the image and caption. The image shows a Pilot gas station, while the caption refers to a Pilot Flying J truck stop in Amarillo, Texas, and a specific claim about a flag.  The internal check's low confidence score (0) accurately reflects the inability to verify the caption's claims from the image alone. However, the external check provides crucial context. It confirms that a claim regarding a flagless Flying J location in Amarillo, Texas, was indeed made, even if later deemed false by Snopes. This external evidence validates the core factual elements of the caption, namely that a claim about a flagless Flying J location in Amarillo, Texas, fueled a controversy. While the image itself doesn't depict the specific location or incident mentioned in the caption, the external check establishes that the caption's factual basis is linked to a real-world event. The discrepancy lies in the image's inability to visually support the specific claim about the flag.  The high confidence score (8) of the external check is justified by the corroborating evidence from Snopes and the explicit mention of the initial Facebook claim about 'foreigners'.  Therefore, while the image does not directly confirm the caption's details, the external evidence shows the caption accurately reports a real-world event and the associated claim; however, the caption is out of context for the image provided.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags a mismatch between the image (Pilot gas station) and the caption (Pilot Flying J in Amarillo, Texas, and a specific flag-related claim). External check confirms the existence of the claim mentioned in the caption, validating the factual basis but noting its falsity.  The caption is factually accurate about a specific claim that existed, but out of context with the provided image."

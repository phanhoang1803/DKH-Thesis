This disinformation displays TCD's phone number and an incorrect TCD email/web address. THESE IMAGES ARE FAKED TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS. But some people believe them. TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didnt come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely. Thurston County Democrats needs your help fighting fascistic disinformation. www.ThurstonDemocrats.org. Thank you.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies that the provided image is a graffiti artwork depicting a figure holding flowers, which is inconsistent with the caption's claim of a recruitment flyer for \"Professional Anarchists.\"  The internal check's low confidence score reflects this discrepancy. However, the external check provides strong evidence supporting the caption's claim that false recruitment flyers are circulating. This creates a contradiction.  The external source explicitly mentions the existence of fake images claiming to recruit \"Professional Anarchists.\" This aligns with the caption's assertion of the existence of such flyers, but it doesn't validate the image itself. The image provided is not a recruitment flyer. Therefore, the caption is out of context concerning the specific image; it's true that fraudulent flyers exist, but the provided visual does not exemplify that claim. The high confidence score of the external check stems from the explicit mention of these fabricated flyers. The visual evidence, however, strongly refutes the caption's implication that the image is one such flyer. To resolve the discrepancy, we need to distinguish between the truth of the caption's overall claim (false recruitment flyers exist) and the truth of the caption's applicability to the provided image (this image is not such a flyer). The external evidence validates the general assertion made in the caption, but the internal analysis and visual evidence show the caption is inaccurate with regards to the specific image. The higher confidence score reflects the stronger external validation of the overall statement, while acknowledging the caption is out of context regarding the image itself.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the caption inconsistent with the image content; external check validates the existence of the fake recruitment flyers mentioned in the caption.  The caption's claim is true in a broader context but is out of context concerning the provided image."

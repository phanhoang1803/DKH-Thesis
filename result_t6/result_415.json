We're an integral part of this city's DNA.\"\nLondon cabbie Andy Biggs, 63, said demand had \"evaporated\" and he was lucky if he had three customers a day.\n\"When we first went back after the initial lockdown, things started to get a little bit better very slowly,\" he said. \"But now it's as dead as it's ever been.\"\nLTDA figures show drivers arriving at Heathrow Airport last month waited an average of nine hours before being dispatched to pick up a passenger.\nHoward Taylor, 60, who has been a cab driver in the capital for more than three decades, said he went to work with \"no expectation at all\" of being hailed for a ride.\n\"I've never seen London like it. In 33 years I've never seen it as quiet, as desolate and depressing.\"\nNorth London-based rental company GB Taxi Services has seen the occupation rate of its fleet of 100 black cabs drop from 95% before the crisis to just 10%.\nIt is one of two firms using an area of farmland in Epping Forest, Essex, to store about 220 unwanted taxis so they can stop paying to insure them.\nAnother rental firm, Sherbet London, has hired a car park to store 400 cabs, representing two-thirds of its fleet.\nChief executive Asher Moses said: \"The whole trade has suffered. There must be 2,000 taxis on fields at the moment.\"\nTfL said it had provided drivers with \"practical advice on a number of issues\" during the crisis, and added that black cabs \"remain an integral part of the transport network\".\nLatest news and stories from London",

    "explanation": "The news caption stating that black cabs are parked on farmland in Epping Forest near London is supported by both internal and external evidence.  The internal check analyzes the image, noting the large number of black cabs parked in what appears to be an open space consistent with farmland.  The mention of Epping Forest and London are consistent with geographical entities.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong visual alignment with the caption's description.

This directly corroborates the caption's claim, further reinforcing the accuracy and context of the statement. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both assessments strongly support the caption's accuracy, leading to a high confidence score of 10 and a conclusion that the caption is not out of context.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both point towards the caption being out of context. The internal check highlights discrepancies between the image (zebras at night, possibly near a vehicle) and the caption (zebras crossing a road during the day, with a motorcyclist present in Kimana Sanctuary, Kenya). The low confidence score of 6 reflects the uncertainty about the vehicle type and the absence of locational details in the image. The external check reinforces this by finding no supporting evidence for the event described in the caption. The lack of corroborating information in external sources contributes to the low confidence score of 0.  Combining these findings, we conclude that the caption does not accurately describe the image. The night setting, the lack of a motorcyclist, and the absence of location specifics within the image itself contradict the claims made in the caption. The visual evidence strongly suggests the event described in the caption did not occur as depicted. The absence of a road and a motorcyclist further weakens the claim.  Even if we assume the light source is a vehicle, the image provides no evidence of a road crossing. The zebras are positioned in an open space, with no indication of a road present. Although the image is low resolution and doesn't allow for detailed observations, there are no discernible road markers, traffic signs, or any element that visually confirms the presence of a road. The overall darkness and ambiguity of the setting make it hard to confidently confirm any details presented in the original caption. Hence, the caption's claim that zebras crossed a road as a motorcyclist waits is considered out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks cast doubt on the caption's accuracy, highlighting significant discrepancies between the image content and the caption's description.  The lack of supporting evidence in external sources further weakens the caption's credibility."

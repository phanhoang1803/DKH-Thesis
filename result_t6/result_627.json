Consequently, flooding of roads and farmland is possible today, Wednesday 01/01/25. We expect flooding to affect low lying land and roads adjacent to the river from Wolverley to Newport. Other locations that may be affected include Market Drayton, Wem and Rodington.\nFurther rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours. We expect river levels to remain high over the next few days.\nWe are closely monitoring the situation.

This rise is from levels which were already high from the previous Winter. Levels are unusually high for this time of year and have now reached a level where communities in the Kimpton and Lilley Bottom area are at risk of being affected by flooding from groundwater. We expect levels to remain high over the coming months in response to the high Autumn rainfall. Low lying land and roads will therefore be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater behaviour, this situation could continue for several weeks or longer. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message on Wednesday the 8th of January 2025 or as the situation changes.\nIssued by: The Environment Agency\nFlood alert\nAreas affected: Groundwater flooding in Flamstead\nACTIVE\nStarted at: 15:14 GMT on Tue 31 December\nFlooding is possible - be prepared\nGroundwater levels have responded to high effective rainfall during the Autumn, and have risen to very high levels at our observation borehole at River Hill, close to Flamstead. Groundwater levels are unusually high for this time of year and have now reached a level where communities are at risk of being affected by flooding from groundwater. We expect levels to remain high over the coming months in response to the high Autumn rainfall. Low lying land and roads such as those in the Trowley Bottom area near Flamstead will therefore be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater behaviour, this situation could continue for several weeks or longer. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message on Wednesday the 8th of January 2025 or as the situation changes.\nIssued by: The Environment Agency\nFlood alert\nAreas affected: Groundwater flooding in the Candovers and Old Alresford\nACTIVE\nStarted at: 11:43 GMT on Tue 31 December\nFlooding is possible - be prepared\nGroundwater levels in the Candovers and Old Alresford are high and remain relatively stable after a week of dry weather. In Preston Candover and Old Alresford, the level is very close to causing cellar flooding impacts to a small number of properties. It is also very close to reducing the ability of septic tanks in Old Alresford to operate effectively. Tomorrow (01/01/2025), unsettled weather is forecast to move over Hampshire bringing between 10 and 20mm of rain. From Thursday (02/01/2025) to Saturday (04/01/2025), the weather is expected to be dry. If the heaviest rain in the forecast affects the area, then it is possible that groundwater levels will rise high enough for cellar flooding and septic tank impacts to occur. We continue to monitor the forecast. We advise residents to remain prepared for flooding impacts this winter. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Tuesday 07/01/2025.\nIssued by: The Environment Agency\nFlood alert\nAreas affected: Groundwater flooding in the Salisbury Plain area\nACTIVE\nStarted at: 09:31 GMT on Tue 31 December\nFlooding is possible - be prepared\nGroundwater levels have slowly started to recede. Levels are very reactive to further rainfall. There is rain forecast for 1st Jan 2025.\nAfter New Year's Day the forecast is for high pressure to build over the next 3-5 days which should see groundwater levels continue to fall.\nFlooding of roads and fields is possible. Where groundwater is near the surface, intense rainfall will lead to surface water flooding.\nResidents are advised to prepare property resilience measures and ensure that pumps are working where they have been installed. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nThis message will be updated by 3 PM on 7/1/2025, or as the situation changes.\nIssued by: The Environment Agency\nFlood alert\nAreas affected: Groundwater flooding in West Ilsley, East Ilsley, Compton, Chilton and West Hagbourne\nACTIVE\nStarted at: 11:57 GMT on Mon 30 December\nFlooding is possible - be prepared\nGroundwater levels are currently rising at our Hodcott borehole near West Ilsley, East Ilsley and Compton as a result of recent rainfall.\nGroundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and have now reached a level where communities may be affected by groundwater flooding within the next few weeks. We expect levels to continue slowly rising over the next few weeks and levels will remain sensitive to further sustained rainfall. Low-lying land and roads will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding.\nDue to the natur",

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows high confidence that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The image clearly depicts a snow-covered golf course, aligning with the description \"Frozen and icy greens and fairways.\" The location, Stonehaven Golf Course, is visually confirmed within the image. However, the external validation completely fails to support the claim, reporting no evidence to corroborate the news caption.  There is no mention of Stonehaven Golf Course or any information concerning its condition. This significant discrepancy creates considerable uncertainty. The lack of external corroboration severely undermines the confidence in the caption's accuracy, despite the strong internal validation. Given the absence of external evidence, relying solely on the internal analysis is risky. The image itself is internally consistent. There's no apparent visual tampering or miscontextualization. Visual details align with the internal validation, showing a snow-covered golf course situated near a body of water. Considering both internal and external checks, the significant discrepancy between the two leads to a low confidence score. While the image strongly suggests the caption's internal consistency, the complete lack of external verification deems the claim as highly questionable and potentially out of context.",

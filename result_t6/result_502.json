      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  Bozena Gomolka is a possible name, Coy Pond Gardens could exist in Poole, Dorset, and taking a photograph in a garden is a common activity. However, without external verification (e.g., confirming the existence of Coy Pond Gardens and whether Bozena Gomolka has publicly shared such a photograph), certainty is limited.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate. The image depicts a serene pond scene in a garden setting, which aligns with the description of Coy Pond Gardens. While neither check definitively confirms the specific location or the photographer's presence, the visual elements and the plausibility of the information suggest that the caption is not out of context. The confidence score reflects the uncertainty due to the lack of definitive external confirmation, while the visual consistency between the image and description lends support to the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption's accuracy, although certainty is limited due to the absence of conclusive external evidence. Visual elements strongly suggest a garden setting, aligning with the caption's description."

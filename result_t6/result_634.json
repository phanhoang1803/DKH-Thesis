        "content": "Even though the 2020 presidential election has yet to occur, people are already thinking about what would happen if the newly elected president left office.\n\"If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election but cannot serve his full term, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris would assume the role of president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become vice president,\" reads a popular Facebook post. \"LET THAT SINK IN!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isnt how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? Its not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didnt have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasnt replaced because a process wasnt codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobarts absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldnt become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but thats for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

      "explanation": "Source 1 directly addresses the question of Nancy Pelosi becoming Vice President if Trump (or in the example, Biden) left office early.  It explicitly states that if the president leaves office, the Vice President becomes president, and the new president would then nominate a new Vice President, who would require confirmation by both houses of Congress.  Pelosi would not automatically assume the Vice Presidency. This directly contradicts the news caption's implication.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds the image consistent with the caption, focusing on the presence of Nancy Pelosi. However, the external validation reveals a significant factual inaccuracy. The external source clarifies the correct succession process in case of a president leaving office early; the Vice President becomes president, and subsequently nominates a new Vice President, subject to Congressional confirmation.  Nancy Pelosi wouldn't automatically become Vice President. This discrepancy is substantial, outweighing the internal consistency assessment.\n\nThe internal check's confidence is high (10) due to the straightforward visual match between Pelosi's image and the caption's mention of her. However, this is outweighed by the external check which has a lower confidence score (8) but points to a critical factual error. The external source directly addresses the core claim made in the caption and refutes it.  The discrepancy lies in the caption's implication of an automatic succession of Nancy Pelosi to the Vice Presidency, which is factually incorrect.\n\nThe visual element does not contradict the presence of Nancy Pelosi; it simply shows her. The caption's error lies in the inaccurate representation of the line of presidential succession. There is no visual evidence to support the caption's implied claim. The image is not misleading, but the caption provides a false narrative.\n\nConsidering the weight of the external evidence, which refutes the central premise of the caption, and acknowledging the discrepancy between the internal and external validation, the final conclusion is that the caption is out of context. The image, showing Nancy Pelosi, is not inherently misleading, but the caption inaccurately describes her role in a hypothetical presidential succession scenario.\n\nIn summary, although the image shows Nancy Pelosi, consistent with the caption’s mention of her, the caption's core claim about her automatically becoming Vice President under specified circumstances is factually incorrect.  The external source provides compelling evidence to refute this claim, which is not countered by any other information.  Therefore, the caption is judged to be out of context.",

However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks yielded conflicting results regarding the accuracy of the caption \"Just a Bernie Sanders rally in California.\" The internal check, with high confidence (score 1), strongly refutes the caption, asserting that the image depicts a large rally in Cuba, not a Bernie Sanders rally. This conclusion is visually supported by the image showing a massive gathering with Cuban flags and a building bearing the words \"Por Cuba: Unidad y Compromiso.\"  In contrast, the external check (score 10) surprisingly supports the caption, citing evidence of multiple Bernie Sanders rallies in California. This discrepancy highlights a critical issue: the external evidence fails to consider the visual content of the image. The external check relies solely on documented Sanders rallies in California without cross-referencing this information with the provided image.  It's important to note that the existence of Bernie Sanders rallies in California does not automatically validate a caption describing *this specific image* as such a rally. The sheer scale and visual context of the image strongly suggest a location and event far removed from any documented Sanders rally in California.  The flags, architecture, and overall scale are inconsistent with any known images of Sanders' California rallies. Therefore, resolving this conflict necessitates prioritizing visual evidence. Since the internal validation aligns perfectly with the visual content of the image, it holds more weight than the external validation, which is based solely on textual information without visual verification.The vast discrepancy between the image content and the caption's claim makes it highly unlikely the image shows a Bernie Sanders rally in California. The visual evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the caption's assertion, making the caption completely out of context. The high internal confidence score (1) combined with a close examination of the image details significantly outweighs the external check's confidence in the absence of visual validation. This makes a strong case for rejecting the caption as a misrepresentation of the depicted event.  Therefore, based on a thorough analysis of visual and textual evidence, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is reached with high confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly refutes the caption based on visual evidence, identifying the location as Cuba, not California. External validation, however, supports the caption, citing confirmed Sanders rallies in California. The visual evidence strongly contradicts the external evidence, resulting in a final verdict that the caption is out of context."

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\nWomen will be the group to soundly reject former President Donald Trump on Election Day, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at the final rally of his campaign Monday night in Detroit.\nFolks, this is getting pretty simple now: Kamala and I trust women, Walz said. Now tomorrow, women all across America, of every age, both parties, are going to send a loud, clear message to Donald Trump, whether he likes it or not.\nThe comment is a callback to Trump telling an audience in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last week that he would protect women as president whether the women like it or not. I am going to protect them. Trump acknowledged during the comment that his top aides urged him not to call himself a protector because it is inappropriate.\nWalzs comment also hints at numerous polls that show a large gender gap in the 2024 race, with women leaning toward Harris and Walz and men leaning toward Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\nHamtramck Mayor Amer Ghalib speaks before Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at a campaign rally at Van Andel Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Grand Rapids, Mich. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\nAmong the speakers to open for a Trump rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were two Muslim mayors of cities in metro Detroit with large Arab American populations.\nHamtramck Mayor Amer Ghalib and Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi, both of whom are Democrats but have endorsed Trump, each called on Arab Americans to support Trump.\nMy message to my fellow Arab and Muslim Americans, your votes in this swing state will change the face of America and your votes will decide the future of America, said Ghalib.\nTrump is hoping to capitalize on the unrest in metro Detroit, home to the nations largest Arab American community that has been upset with the Biden-Harris administrations handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\nBazzi, who has faced pushback from some in his community, said that he would rather lose my election than have a bunch of warmongers win the election.\nAmanda Geist, of Croydon in Bucks County, usually works the polls, but she took a break this year and will instead bring her 11-year-old daughter, Annalise, with her to vote Tuesday.\nThey attended the rally together near the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Annalise had scored a free campaign T-shirt. She wishes she could vote.\nI think it would be amazing seeing a woman president, Annalise said.\nTheir neighborhood in Croydon leans toward Trump, and Geist said Harris signs have been destroyed or stolen. That doesnt make her hopeful the country will come together after the election. She thinks it may take another election cycle to cool things down.\nI dont think were in a better place than we were last time, to be honest, Geist said, maybe worse.\nTien Nguyen, 34, a tech industry worker in Philadelphia, planned to have friends over Tuesday night for what shes calling the Election Night Anxiety Fest.\nWere going to eat our emotions, Nguyen said as she waited for the Harris rally in Philadelphia to start.\nThis time around, I know Im going to be very anxious, and I just want people around, she said.\nShe doesnt expect to know whos president before the party ends  she said she thinks it will take until the weeks end.\nNguyen hopes to see Harris named the first woman president, but her background also resonates with her as they both come from a family of immigrants. Nguyen was born to Vietnamese parents in the Philippines, then raised in the Philadelphia area since she was 3.\nShe said she thinks Harris background gives her more perspective and empathy than the men who have filled the Oval Office to date.\nHopefully having a woman president there leads to more world peace, less conflict, she said.\nHarris and Trumps differences have long been clear. But on Monday night in Pittsburgh, their dueling rallies drove home just how large the gulf between them truly is.\nOnly 9 miles (14 kilometers) separated the two in the key Pennsylvania city. Trump spoke at PPG Paints Arena, home to the Pittsburgh Penguins, in one of his standard arena rally setups. Harris spoke at Carrie Furnaces, a historic steel facility with an event that nodded to Pittsburghs place as the heart of the countrys steel industry.\nHarris spoke for 10 minutes. Trump spoke for 950% more, clocking in an hour and 45 minutes.\nHarris was introduced by comedian Cedric the Entertainer and seen off by a performance from artist Katy Perry. Trump brought conservative commentator Megyn Kelly on stage and touted the support of Roberto Clemente Jr., the son of the famed Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder.\nHarris is closing her campaign by barely mentioning Trump directly. This is it, Harris said at her event. Tomorrow is Election Day, and the momentum is on our side.\nTrump repeatedly invoked Harris  and her nearby rally.\nIf you vote for Kamala, you will have four more years of misery, failure, and disaster, and our country may never recover, Trump told his audience, earning boos. Later, he added, Kamala has a little rally going on. And when I say little, I mean little.\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Trumps running mate, has referred to Kamala Harris as trash.\nSpeaking Monday in Atlanta, Vance ripped Harris by referencing a comment made by President Joe Biden suggesting that Trump supporters were garbage. Biden, in turn, was responding to a joke by comic Tony Hinchcliffe at Trumps recent Madison Square Garden rally in which Hinchcliffe likened Puerto Rico to a floating island of garbage.\nThe Trump campaign has faced days of criticism from Harris allies over Hinchcliffes joke. It has focused on Bidens reference to Trump supporters instead.\nVance told the Atlanta audience that Americans should not be called garbage for supporting border restrictions or wanting to be able to afford groceries.\nIn two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trashs name is Kamala Harris, he said.\nThe comment stirred anger among Harris allies online. Levar Stoney, the mayor of Richmond, Virginia, said Vance had made one of the worst mistakes of his political career.\nKaty Perry performs during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris at Carrie Blast Furnaces in Pittsburgh, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\nPerry, who is from Harris home state of California, says that Daisy, her daughter with actor Orlando Bloom, is the reason I am voting for Kamala Harris.\nIve known Kamala since before she was a senator, the singer said. Ive always known her to fight for the most vulnerable, to speak up for the voiceless. To protect our rights as women to make decisions about our own bodies, yeah! Go figure! I know she will protect my daughters future, and your childrens future.\nShe then sang The Greatest Love of All, originally by George Benson but best known for Whitney Houstons version, which begins, I believe the children are our future, blending it into her 2010 hit Firework.\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, left, greets Roberto Clemente Jr., right, at a campaign rally at PPG Paints Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Matt Freed)\nTrump touted the endorsement of Roberto Clemente Jr., the son of the MLB Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, a prominent Puerto Rican who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nTrump hopes Clemente Jr.'s backing can help him with Hispanic voters after a comics joke at his Madison Square Garden rally offended many Puerto Ricans.\nMy father, the name Clemente, what it means is goodwill and unity, Clemente said at Trumps Pittsburgh rally. I believe that your team is going to bring it all home.\nClemente said he wants to help Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump says will have virtually free reign to oversee health programs despite his history of promoting theories that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists.\nTrump called the endorsement a great honor. Clemente Jr. had his own brief MLB career.\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris arrives to speak during a rally at Carrie Blast Furnaces in Pittsburgh, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\nHarris urged her supporters not to be shy about asking people in their lives to get out and vote.\nPittsburgh, listen, weve got one day left to get this done, Harris said in the penultimate speech of her campaign. So now we work to get out the vote. Lets reach out in these next 24 hours to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers.\nHarris remarks were notably short in Pittsburgh. She spoke for under 10 minutes before singer Katy Perry took the stage to perform.\nI am asking for your vote, Harris said, adding later, Your vote is your voice and your voice is your power.\nHarris now travels to Philadelphia for the final rally of her campaign.\nHarris projected the confidence her campaign is feeling at the penultimate event of her presidential run, telling an audience on Monday night in Pittsburgh that the momentum is on our side.\nThis is it, Harris said with Carrie Furnaces behind her, a historic steel facility that nodded to Pittsburghs history as the heart of the countrys steel industry. Tomorrow is Election Day, and the momentum is on our side.\nWe must finish strong, Harris added. Make no mistake, we will win.\nThis is not Harris final stop of the night. She will head to Philadelphia for the final event of her campaign.\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump greets Megyn Kelly at a campaign rally at PPG Paints Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Pittsburgh, Pa. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nIt was a full-circle moment for the two after Trump and the broadcaster feuded bitterly and publicly during Trumps 2016 campaign.\nKelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to protect women, and pressed his case against Harris as weak on the border.\nHe got mocked by the left by saying he would be a protector of women, Kelly said. He will be a protector of women and its why Im voting for him. He will close the border and he will keep the boys out of womens sports where they dont belong.\nTrump stood to the side, grinning and beaming, as Kelly spoke.\nKelly was a Fox News star in 2016 when she infuriated Trump at a GOP debate with a question about his treatment of women. He bitterly attacked her after the debate, and his supporters joined in, leaving her worried about threats.\nTrump later boycotted another debate telecast by Fox because Kelly was one of the moderators.\nKelly left Fox for NBC News, an ill fit where she was taken off the air following an uproar when she suggested it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween. She now hosts a SiriusXM satellite radio show.\nPaul Henley, a military veteran from the Grand Rapids area, was attending his first Donald Trump rally Monday night in western Michigan with his 15-year-old son.\nI just thought it was a very important moment in history, said Henley. Regardless of whether Trump wins or loses  I do hope he wins  it will be his last rally.\nHenley added that its an important kind of closure on history, on this chapter, this tumultuous time in America.\nWhile Henley said that he didnt necessarily have an issue with absentee voting, he planned to vote on Election Day. He supports Trump due to his fiscal policies and Trumps ability to create peace through strength in the Middle East during his time in office.\nWhoever wins the election, Henley said that he is hopeful for a peaceful transfer of power, assuming theres a free and fair election and everything was on the up and up.\nWhenever they decide to close the election out, if Kamala Harris is the president of the United States, then begrudgingly shes the president, said Henley. I say begrudgingly, because I will always respect the office of the president.\nI just wish we could focus on our commonalities and our common interests and work toward the common good and strive to make America the best country you can be, Henley added. You know, one where kids can ride their bikes till the lamp posts turn off.\nIts sad because weve been doing this for nine years, Trump said in Pittsburgh after inviting members of his family to join him on stage.\nTrump is holding his second-to-last rally of the 2024 election  and says hell be done once this ends. His rallies became a cultural phenomenon during his 2015 campaign, drawing thousands of people who often camped out overnight or waited for hours in freezing cold or blazing heat.\nI have one left. And remember the rallies are the most exciting thing. Therell never be rallies like this, he said. This is never going to happen again.\nTrump says this will be his last campaign for the White House  and hes finishing it just as he started his first.\nHe is leaning into hardline immigration rhetoric and vowing to liberate the country from what he describes as an occupation.\nIts rhetoric that has animated his core supporters since he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination  and that still earns him some of his loudest applause. His call for the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen drew hoots and whistles and a USA! chant.\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at PPG Paints Arena, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Pittsburgh, Pa., as Lara Trump, Michael Boulos, Tiffany Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., listen. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nTrump invited several of his children on stage as he spoke nostalgically about the end of his campaign.\nHe told a story about his youngest son, Barron Trump, teaching him about technology.\nDo I have good kids? Trump said to loud cheers. Are my kids here? Where are my kids?\nHe was joined on stage by Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and his wife Lara, along with Tiffany Trump and her husband. He said Barron was watching from home and Ivanka Trump loves the whole thing.\nSeveral of Trumps children joined him on stage at another rally earlier Monday in Reading, Pennsylvania.\nAhead of Donald Trumps final rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan  the same place he closed out his 2016 and 2020 campaigns  state party chair Pete Hoekstra said he feels very confident that Trump will carry the state and win another four years in the White House.\nIm optimistic. Very bullish on Michigan, Hoekstra told The Associated Press.\nRepublicans have also focused on election security in Michigan, but on Monday night, Hoekstra said that so far he felt good about the security of the election, but you never know what you dont know.\nOverall, were feeling good. Weve got a great effort in place, said Hoekstra, adding that a war room was in place to take calls if there were any issues with voting tomorrow.\nTrump says he wants to see the successful Penn State wrestling team compete against migrants, painting a picture of people crossing the border illegally as strong and nasty.\nI want the migrants to go against the champion, and I think the migrant might actually win, Trump said, describing migrants  as he often does  as killers whove spent time in jail.\nHe said he met the wrestlers recently and told them they might be the only guys in the country who can beat the hell out of the migrants.\nHe had a similar riff at a rally earlier Monday.\nImmigration has been Trumps signature issue since the day he announced his first campaign for president. He often uses dehumanizing language to describe migrants and massively inflates the danger posed by immigrants, who commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.\nThe election may be a nail-biter, but Andra Day said at a rally for Harris in Pittsburgh that she has complete faith when it comes to the voting power of the people of Pennsylvania.\nI love women in positions of power, she said in her introduction.\nThen she launched into a cover of Billie Holidays God Bless the Child, a nod to her role as Holiday in 2021s The United States vs. Billie Holiday. It earned Day an Oscar nomination. Day also performed an original song, Empty, from her latest album Cassandra.\nIn 2020, Andra Day performed her hit Rise Up, what became an unofficial anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement, during President Joe Bidens virtual inaugural parade.\nFederal authorities have arrested a Georgia election worker accused of sending a letter threatening poll workers he wrote to make it seem like it had come from a voter he had gotten into a fight with earlier.\nNicholas Wimbish, 25, of Milledgeville, Georgia, got into a verbal altercation with a voter while serving a poll worker at the Jones County Election Office in Gray, Georgia, last month, the Justice Department said.\nThe next day, prosecutors say he sent a letter from a Jones County Voter to the the elections superintendent. The letter said Wimbish was conspiring votes and distracting voters from concentrating. It said Wimbish and others should should look over their shoulder and that I know where they all live because I found home voting addresses for all them.\nProsecutors say Wimbish wrote at the bottom of the typed letter: PS boom toy in early vote place, cigar burning, be safe.\nWhen authorities interviewed Wimbish about the letter, he blamed it on the voter, according to court records.\nHes charged with mailing a bomb threat, conveying false information about a bomb threat, mailing a threatening letter and making false statements to FBI agents.\nThere was no lawyer listed for Wimbish in court records. A message was left at a number listed for him in public records.\nThe event at PPG Paints Arena will serve as Trumps campaigns closing message of the race, aides say.\nWhile the arenas upper level seating has been blocked off  and some seats remain empty in the lower sections  Trump has drawn a crowd of thousands to the venue, which has a capacity of 14,000 to 19,000, depending on how the seating is arranged.\nTrump has been drawing smaller crowds in the closing stretch of the campaign than he did in previous races.\nThat could be, in part, because he has been returning again and again to the same battleground states, sometimes speaking in the same places  and even the same venues  where he spoke just days earlier.\n1 of 6 |\nPhotographer Carlos Salas, 78, who recently became a U.S. citizen and voted in his first election, poses with his camera at his studio, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024, in Alamo, Texas.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\nAfter living in the U.S. for over 60 years and never attempting to seek citizenship, Carlos Salas said he was compelled to wake up to his civic duties.\nHe resides in Alamo, Texas, just 8 miles (13 kilometers) from the border. This year, at age 78, he voted for the first time in his life.\nBorn in Veracruz, Mexico, Salas arrived in the U.S. at age 14. He has spent the past 30 years as a photographer traveling around the Rio Grande Valley, the southernmost part of Texas. He photographs families at special events like quinceaeras. Occasionally he walks to Nuevo Progreso, Tamaulipas in Mexico to pick up a souvenir for his wife.\nSalas said the fear of being returned to Mexico kept him from seeking citizenship and the right to vote. But this year he said hes driven to the polls out of concern for those who, like him, are hardworking immigrants seeking safety and shelter in the U.S.\nNational Guard officials say more than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send Guard troops to Washington if needed and requested in the coming weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration.\nThe District of Columbia has not yet made any formal request for Guard troops. But officials across the government have been meeting and preparing for the possibility that the U.S. Capitol could once again be rocked by violence around the certification of the election by Congress on Jan. 6 and the inauguration two weeks after that.\nSpeaking to reporters Monday, Col. Jean Paul Laurenceau, chief of future operations for the National Guard Bureau, said it is not yet clear how many Guard troops will be needed or requested this year.\nHe said it will depend on what the District of Columbia wants but noted that the National Guard Bureau and the states are leaning forward in anticipation of a request for assistance.\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, right, hugs a voter as she knocks on doors during a campaign stop in Reading, Pa., Monday, Nov. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\nHarris went canvassing in Pennsylvania on the eve of Election Day, visiting two homes in Reading as she campaigned throughout the state.\nHarris, and the considerable motorcade she travels in, pulled up to a home where three people waited for the Democratic nominee.\nHi guys, Harris said.\nOh my God, said the family, seeing the vice president on their porch.\nSorry for the intrusion, Harris added. The family said they planned to vote on Tuesday morning and that they had made up their minds, but they did not say who they were backing.\nHarris, accompanied by two campaign volunteers, then walked a few doors down, where a woman told the vice president, You already got my vote and gave her a hug as dogs barked in the background. She told the vice president that her husband, who shook Harris hand as he emerged from the house, planned to vote Tuesday.\nIts the day before the election and I just wanted to come by and say I hope to earn your vote, Harris told the woman.\nThe Democratic nominee could also be heard telling the women about needing to find common ground, a familiar line from her stump speech.\nIm anxious. I think we all are, said Nancy Julian of Pittsburgh.\nBut she said it was important to turn out to support Harris, whom she said she has admired since Harris was on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBradyn Yahner of Altoona, wearing a camo-style Harris-Walz hat, said he shares the vice presidential nominees affinity for hunting and camping.\nYou can be a supporter of those things as far as guns go and still understand that the U.S. does need better gun restrictions, he said.\nHe was attending with Katrina Shedd of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. They were feeling hopeful about the election, saying the energy here is even stronger than at an earlier Harris rally they attended in Erie.\nIm here fighting for womens rights, gay peoples rights, trans peoples rights, Shedd said. We cannot truly be free until every person has the same human rights.\nSarah Kesner of Pulaski, Pennsylvania, said she was backing Harris because she supports democracy, and I dont support bullies, and he (Trump) always has been one.\nHer son, Joshua Kesner of Hubbard, Ohio, wearing a Veterans for Harris  T-shirt, said the vote was important to him as an Army veteran.\nWe all, when we join the military, take an oath to defend the Constitution, he said. That means voting for the candidate who will defend the Constitution, rather than trample on it.\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, from right, visits Old San Juan Cafe restaurant with restaurant owner Diana de La Rosa and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., during a campaign stop in Reading, Pa., Monday, Nov. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\nHarris, flanked by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, mingled with diners at Old San Juan Cafe, a Puerto Rican restaurant in Reading, a Northeast Pennsylvania city with a large concentration of Puerto Ricans. She asked about school, the restaurant and what kind of food she should take to-go.\nHarris did not mention a comedian telling a recent crowd at a Trump rally that Puerto Rico was a floating island of garbage, but she didnt need to  the scene of Harris ordering Puerto Rican food with imagery from the island everywhere was enough to prove the point.\nThe Democratic presidential nominee eagerly looked on as the owner walked her through what they had to offer. At first, she said she was interested in a spicy taquito, but after going through the rice, plantains, pork and cassava, Harris added, I want that too. Im very hungry. I dont get to eat as often as I like. She paid for her order with a credit card.\nIm very happy to be here, Harris said. Ive been reading about your restaurant.\nAfter she and Ocasio Cortez touted the Latino owner of the cafe and the work that went into the restaurant, Harris said: I have a saying, I eat no for breakfast. Which means I dont hear no.\nPennsylvania has become a key part of the final day of the campaign between Harris and Trump. Both were in Reading on Monday.\nMillions more Americans in some states chose to vote early compared to the last presidential election, despite the unusually high advance voting due the COVID-19 pandemic at the time.\nIn New York, nearly 3 million advance ballots have been counted compared to just over 1.5 million advance voters in 2020. This year, advance votes amongst registered Republicans in Louisiana, as well as the battleground states of Florida and North Carolina, outpaced 2020s numbers.\nIn those same states, and in the additionally closely-watched Arizona, advance votes totals amongst registered Republicans is greater than Democrats right now.\nAlondra Cortes, who attended Harris Allentown rally, said it made her cry with happiness just hours before Cortes  a first-time voter born and raised in Puerto Rico  becomes the first in her family to vote in a mainland U.S. election.\nThis is my first rally ever. I am a first time voter, so its really, really nice. Some tears were shed. Im really excited to vote, Cortes, 21, said.\nShes really inspirational, especially for a minority like me, so Im really excited to vote for her, she added, speaking about Harris.\nCortes, a senior at Moravian University, said she has class in the morning and then work, but shell go vote with her friends and hopes to celebrate after that, since theyre all first-time voters.\nHarris supporters were chanting Si se puede and Kamala as the vice presidents motorcade pulled up to Old San Juan Cafe, a Puerto Rican restaurant in Reading, Pennsylvania.\nHarris stop, her third of the day in Pennsylvania, has a clear focus: Call out Trump for allowing a comedian at his recent rally at Madison Square Garden to label Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Trump has not apologized for the comedians comment, but his campaign attempted to distance itself from the remark.\nThat didnt work, and the comment has dominated the closing days of the campaign.\nHarris, who has four scheduled events in the commonwealth, drove over an hour from Allentown to visit the cafe in Reading, a Northeast Pennsylvania city with a large concentration of Puerto Ricans and other Latinos. Supporters lined the streets as Harris arrived at the restaurant.\nThis image made from a NASA live stream shows NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore during a press conference from the International Space Station on Friday, Sept. 13, 2024. (NASA via AP)\nNASA makes it easy to vote in space.\nHeres how it works: Astronauts fill out their ballots, which are loaded into the space stations computers. The encrypted ballots are routed via satellite to ground stations in New Mexico and then transmitted to Mission Control at Johnson Space Center in Houston. The NASA center then electronically submits the ballots to the appropriate county clerks office in Texas for filing.\nThe four NASA astronauts living at the International Space Station requested absentee ballots ahead of Election Day. But NASA isnt saying whether they voted, saying its up to the astronauts to confirm whether they cast their ballots from orbit.\nSuni Williams, the space stations commander, said in a TV interview last month that all four would vote. Its a civic duty. Its the right thing to do, she said.\nAmericans have voted from space since 1997.\nA crowd gathered outside Old San Juan Cafe, a Puerto Rican restaurant in Reading, Pennsylvania, to catch a glimpse of Harris.\nIm so proud that shes in our neighborhood, said Juan Rivas, 66, a Dominican American who lives just a block from the restaurant. Shes the only who can do something for this country. I dont think Trump with his hypocrisy, and his hate of Hispanics can do anything. He only thinks about himself and the rich, and even when he tries to benefit himself, he leaves a trail of debts behind him.\nTrump had also been in Reading earlier Monday, hosting a rally at Santander Arena.\nRivas said that he has several Puerto Rican friends and they were all equally disgusted by comments made against the island during Trumps rally.\nWhatever they say about a Hispanic, they say about me, said the retiree, who had already mailed his vote for Harris.\nHis wife walked out of their home to take photos of Harris supporters that waited for Harris behind a police line.\nIm so excited, Claudia Guzman, 52 said.

They also said that Krasners bid to shut it down under Pennsylvania law was moot because there would be no more Pennsylvania winners before the program ends Tuesday.\nDistrict Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, believes the giveaways violate state election law and contradict what Musk promised when he announced them during an appearance with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19: Were going to be awarding a million dollars randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election, Musk vowed.\n Read more about the decision on Musks sweepstakes\nSeveral hundred voters wait in line to vote outside the Douglas County Election Commission office on Nov. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Margery Beck)\nBetween 400 and 500 people snaked out the door and around the corner of the Douglas County Election Commission office  the only place in the states most populous county where people can vote early in person. The crowds have been present every day for at least two weeks to cast their ballots, but the crush was particularly heavy Monday.\nNearly 370,000 people are registered to vote in Douglas County, and County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse has predicted voter turnout to be 73%. About half of Douglas County voters are expected to vote early, the commission office said.\nPhiladelphia rapper and prison reform activist Meek Mill surprise released a new track, Who You Voting For on Monday afternoon, sharing a snippet of the song with the caption, I made this last night  who you voting for??? on TikTok.\nMy homie say vote for Trump / You want that stimulus / I wanted two from him but the way he movin venomous, he starts the song. Im going probably vote Kamala.\nIt aint fair when your lawyer look like Trump / D.A. lookin like Kamala, he continues, critiquing Harris past as a prosecutor. We Thanksgiving to the system / Theyve been eating us for lunch / And its the last supper / Hope you be with us for once, Mrs. Harris.\nIn 2017, Meek Mill was sentenced for probation violations involving a decade-old gun and drug possession case. The Pennsylvania trial judge sentenced him to two to four years in prison, but a court ordered his release in April 2018.\nOn July 24, 2019, an appeals court tossed his conviction over doubts about the arresting officers credibility. The next month, Meek Mill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge in a deal that resolved the 2007 arrest, ending his legal limbo with the criminal justice system. He is now an activist for justice reform.\nThreats against election workers have gotten so bad that all polling places in Washoe County, Nevada, have a panic button that workers can hit to automatically call 911.\nBut Andrew McDonald, the deputy registrar of voters in the swing county of half a million people, says theres only been one incident in nearly two weeks of in-person early voting that required someone to hit the panic button.\nThat incident, McDonald said at a press conference, involved a voter at one of the countys 24 early voting sites who would not remove his hat when asked by a worker, who was following state law prohibiting campaign signs or paraphernalia within 100 feet (30 meters) of a polling station.\nA few other voters in line sort of ganged up on the site manager, McDonald said. But when police arrived, he added, they calmed down and were able to vote.\nWashoe has become a hotbed for election conspiracy theorists who believe Trumps lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Still, McDonald noted that the panic button incident is the only significant one thats happened during the early vote period, when 90,000 people cast their ballots.\nI get an incident report daily, McDonald said, and there havent been that many incidents.",

    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption mostly accurate as the image shows President Trump dancing with Melania Trump during what appears to be an inaugural event. However, the mention of a Ukrainian lawmaker posting photos on Facebook is not visually verifiable from the image itself.  The external check completely contradicts the caption, stating there's no evidence to support the claim about the 2017 inauguration dance in the context of the 2024 presidential election.  The discrepancy arises from the external check's focus on a different context (2024 election) compared to the caption's reference (2017 inauguration). Because the external check failed to find relevant information in the expected context of the caption (the 2017 inauguration), its verdict must be considered with caution. While the image visually supports part of the caption, the lack of external verification for the claim about the Ukrainian lawmaker, and the mismatch in contextual information between the external source and the caption, leads to a low confidence score and an 'out-of-context' conclusion.  In essence, we can visually confirm part of the caption's claim (the Trumps dancing at an event), but the additional detail about the Ukrainian lawmaker's actions is unsupported externally and not directly visible in the image. The external resource failed to account for the time period mentioned in the original caption, making the external verification effort unreliable in this case. A more relevant external source focusing on the 2017 inauguration would be needed to definitively verify the entire caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially supports the caption (visual evidence of Trumps dancing), but external check fails to find supporting evidence due to a contextual mismatch. The discrepancy results in a low confidence score and an out-of-context classification."

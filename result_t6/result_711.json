He was taken to hospital for a check-up and is not believed to have suffered any injuries.\nThe sculpture, titled Whale Tails, is the work of the architect and artist Maarten Struijs, and was erected in the water at the end of the tracks in 2002.\nMr Struijs told NOS that he was surprised the structure did not break.\n\"It has been there for almost 20 years and... you actually expect the plastic to pulverise a bit, but that is apparently not the case,\" he said.\n\"I'll make sure that I get a few photos,\" he added. \"I could never have imagined it that way.\"\nAll images subject to copyright.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly support the accuracy of the news caption. The image clearly depicts a train stopped by a whale tail sculpture, preventing it from falling into the water below. The internal check highlights this visual evidence, assigning a confidence score of 10. The external check corroborates this by referencing a source that explicitly confirms the train's derailment was halted by the sculpture and the driver's uninjured escape, further reinforcing a confidence score of 10. There are no discrepancies between the visual evidence, the internal analysis, and the external verification.  The caption accurately reflects the event depicted in the image and supported by external information.  No evidence suggests visual tampering or miscontextualization. The detailed descriptions in both the internal and external checks leave no room for uncertainty. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) solidify the conclusion that the caption is not out of context and accurately describes the image.",

        "date": "2016-10-14T06:22:17",
        "content": "Claim:\nScientists have officially declared the Great Barrier Reef to be dead.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn October 11, 2016, Outside Magazine Online published a piece titled Obituary: Great Barrier Reef (25 Million BC2016), which used the obituary format as a vehicle to describe the perilously fragile state of the Great Barrier Reef  the world's largest coral reef system that lies off the coast of Queensland, Australia  in the face of increasing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidity. The obit opened with the statement that \"The Great Barrier Reef of Australia passed away in 2016 after a long illness. It was 25 million years old.\"\nThis bleak assessment was a response to a number of different reports describing the extent of a massive coral bleaching event from earlier in 2016. Coral bleaching, as defined by Australia's National Coral Bleaching Task Force:\noccurs when abnormal environmental conditions, like heightened sea temperatures cause corals to expel tiny photosynthetic algae, called zooxanthellae. The loss of these colourful algae causes the corals to turn white, and bleach. Bleached corals can recover if the temperature drops and zooxanthellae are able to recolonise them, otherwise the coral may die.\nIn March 2016, the Coral Bleaching task force, a joint effort between members of numerous educational and governmental research organizations, released a preliminary report that concluded that a section of the Great Barrier Reef was \"experiencing the worst mass bleaching event in its history\":\nAerial surveys of more than 500 coral reefs from Cairns to Papua New Guinea reveal that the most pristine section of the Great Barrier Reef is currently experiencing the worst, mass bleaching event in its history, with the overwhelming majority of reefs being ranked in the most severe bleaching category.\nIn May 2016, the Australian non-profit research group Climate Council also released a report that offered similar dire information:\nThe latest surveys indicate that 93% of the individual reefs in the GBR have suffered some degree of bleaching, with reefs in the north the most severely affected. Australias marine biodiversity, and the jobs and economic prosperity that the reef supports, is under grave threat.\nThis report also warned that similar events would be more frequent in the face of higher global temperatures:\nMoreover, climate change is very likely to make the extreme ocean temperatures that caused this years event occur every two years during March by 2034. Extreme coral bleaching will become the new normal unless serious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are achieved.\nAdding to this grim outlook, a survey of the extent and severity of coral bleaching between March and June 2016 conducted by the Australian Governments Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and released on 13 October 2016 found that:\n22 per cent of coral on the Reef died due to the worst mass bleaching event on record. Eighty-five per cent of this mortality occurred in the 600 kilometre stretch between the tip of Cape York and just north of Lizard Island. Overall, the area south of Cairns escaped significant mortality.\nWhile the threats to the Great Barrier Reef are well documented and not controversial amongst the scientific community, no scientist has actually proclaimed the reef (which, in reality, is a massive sprawling collection of organisms) to be \"officially dead\". It is also unclear what organization or individual would, like a doctor in an ER, have the authority to pronounce a massive ecological community \"officially dead.\"\"\nIn fact, scientists have expressed frustration with the virality of the Outside Magazine piece, arguing that it both misinforms the public and suggests that efforts made to reverse the damage to the reef are fruitless, as the Huffington Post observed:\nRussell Brainard, chief of the Coral Reef Ecosystem Program at NOAAs Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, told HuffPost he expects the article was meant to highlight the urgency of the situation. But those who dont know any better are going to take it at face value that the Great Barrier Reef is dead, he said.\nTerry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said that he was not impressed by the [articles] message that we should give up on the [Great Barrier Reef], or that it is already dead.\nIn the same Huffington Post report, Hughes noted that the Outside Magazine piece wasnt entirely accurate, either:\nAdditionally, Hughes said, the article is full of mistakes. It states that the Great Barrier Reef experienced its first mass-bleaching event in 1981. But Hughes said the first was in 1998. Additionally, the article mentions the winter of 199798, which of course would have been summer in the southern hemisphere.\nAbove all, Brainard and Hughes stressed the importance of optimism when it comes to facing such a global crisis. As Brainard wrote in a comment on Outside Magazines Facebook post, this sort of over-to-top story makes the situation much worse by conveying loss of hope rather than a need for global society to take actions to reverse these discouraging downward trends.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The image clearly depicts bleached coral, which is directly linked to rising ocean temperatures. The internal check highlights the image's visual evidence of bleached coral and the established scientific understanding of the relationship between rising ocean temperatures and coral bleaching.  The external check supports this by citing a source that explains the phenomenon of coral bleaching and its direct causal relationship with heightened sea temperatures.  While the caption mentions Papua New Guinea, the image itself does not explicitly confirm the location; however, the caption's geographic association is plausible given the prevalence of coral reefs and instances of coral bleaching in that region. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external validation results. Both methods converge to indicate a high degree of confidence in the caption's accuracy and relevance to the presented image. The lack of explicit location confirmation in the image is a minor limitation; however, it does not significantly detract from the overall accuracy of the caption, given the general geographic plausibility and the strong supporting evidence from both internal and external checks.  The visual evidence strongly supports the caption's statement about coral bleaching caused by rising ocean temperatures. There is no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization. Overall, the caption accurately reflects the image's content and aligns well with established scientific knowledge about coral bleaching. Considering both internal and external assessments, the confidence score of 9 reflects the high level of certainty in the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the caption's accuracy.  The image depicts bleached coral, consistent with the caption's description and the established link between rising ocean temperatures and coral bleaching. The geographic location mentioned in the caption is plausible, though not explicitly confirmed by the image."

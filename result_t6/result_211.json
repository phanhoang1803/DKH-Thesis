Some joked about this being a real video of a living triceratops, some pondered if it was possible, while others simply wondered what the heck was going on.\nFor starters, this is not a living and breathing triceratops. The rhinoceros-looking dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period  about 68 million years ago  but went extinct along with all other non-avian dinosaurs during the CretaceousPaleogene (KPg) extinction event about 66 million years ago. In other words, it would be unusual to see a living, breathing triceratops in the wild today.\nThis video actually features a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia called Mojosemi Forest Park. While we're not exactly certain how this puppet was created, a longer video from this dino-themed amusement park appears to show that this triceratops is operated possibly by two people inside of an elaborate costume:\nhttps://fb.watch/2oxNZxaLhE/\nWhile some may have taken pause when they first saw the triceratops video, other videos from Mojosemi Forest Park clearly show that dinosaurs have not actually been brought back from extinction.\nhttps://fb.watch/2oyqfR9Klr/",

    "explanation": "The original news caption states that a video of a living triceratops being unloaded from a truck circulated online in December 2020. Both internal and external checks confirm this claim. However, the image itself reveals that the \"triceratops\" is actually a large statue. The internal check correctly identifies the image as showing a triceratops statue, but the caption does not explicitly state it's a statue. The external check supports the caption's claim regarding the video's circulation but doesn't specifically address the statue's nature.  The discrepancy lies in the caption's misleading implication of a live triceratops, while both the image and the external evidence (though implicitly) suggest it is a statue. Because the caption is misleading about the subject's nature (living vs. statue), and the visual evidence contradicts the implication, the caption is deemed out of context. The high confidence score reflects the certainty in identifying the object in the image as a statue and the confirmation that the video circulated as described in the caption.",

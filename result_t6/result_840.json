    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch between the image and the caption. The image depicts a person holding a fidget spinner, a common toy, while the caption describes a bizarre and improbable medical incident involving a fidget spinner. The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this clear discrepancy.  The external check strengthens this conclusion by referencing a Snopes article that debunks the story described in the caption. Snopes provides details of the fake news story about a man hospitalized due to a fidget spinner lodged in his anus, confirming that the caption is false and unrelated to the image. The external check's confidence score of 2 indicates a high degree of certainty in its findings.  Both checks agree that the caption is out of context. There is no visual evidence in the image that supports the claim made in the caption; the image shows only a person handling the toy. The high degree of agreement between both the internal and external checks and the lack of any visual support for the caption justifies a confidence score of 10.  The image is entirely unrelated to the event described.  There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization. The visual details perfectly align with the assessment that the caption is false and out of context.  There's no ambiguity or uncertainty; the image's context is unambiguous, and the external source provides undeniable evidence that the caption is fabricated.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image shows a person holding a fidget spinner, while the caption describes an improbable medical emergency.  External verification confirms the caption's narrative is false news."

Jean Carroll, who's accused him of past sexual assault, proving he was lying when he said he didn't know her.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nOn 25 June 2019, social media users shared an image of Jill Harth, a woman who has accused Donald Trump of groping her, apparently confusing her with E. Jean Carroll, yet another woman who accused the incumbent U.S. president of past sexual assault:\nThis is a picture of Harth, not Carroll, although some users shared it with the erroneous belief that it undermined Trump's claim that he didn't know Carroll. Carroll has accused him of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman fitting room in the mid-1990s.\nIn an interview with The Hill, Trump said the incident never happened, stating that Carroll was \"not my type.\"\n\"I don't know anything about her,\" Trump declared. \"I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is -- it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that.\"\n(New York magazine and other mainstream news outlets published a different photograph showing Trump in the company of Carroll, her then-husband John Johnson, and Trump's then-wife Ivana at a public event in the 1980s. Trump didn't question the authenticity of that photograph but continued to insist, in spite of it, that he had \"absolutely no idea\" who E. Jean Carroll was.)\nThe image of Harth with Trump was taken more than 20 years earlier. Harth accused Trump of having groped her in 1992 in his daughter's bedroom. The picture was published during a 2016 broadcast of the TV news show Inside Edition, in a story about Harth's allegations. It can be viewed at about the 45-second mark in the video below:",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes directly addresses the claim in the news caption.  While a photo of Trump with E. Jean Carroll exists (mentioned in the Snopes article), the viral photo referenced in the caption is actually of Jill Harth, another accuser.  Snopes explicitly states the viral image was miscaptioned and used erroneously to support the claim that Trump lied about not knowing Carroll. The caption's claim is therefore partially true (a photo exists of Trump and Carroll, though not the viral one), but misleading (the viral photo is not of Carroll) ",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) that the image depicts Donald Trump and E. Jean Carroll, supporting the caption's claim that Trump was lying about not knowing her.  However, this interpretation is subjective, as the image only shows their co-presence. The external check (score 8), referencing Snopes, reveals a crucial discrepancy.  While it confirms the existence of photographs of Trump with Carroll, it explicitly states that the *viral* photo referenced in the news caption is actually of Jill Harth, another accuser.  This means the caption is misusing a photo to support its claim.  The internal validation focuses solely on the visual evidence present within the provided image, whereas external validation delves into the broader context and origin of the viral image in question. The disagreement stems from the caption's implied assertion (that the viral picture definitively proves Trump's lie) versus the reality (that the viral picture is misidentified and irrelevant to Carroll's accusation).  External evidence undermines the caption's central claim by highlighting the misidentification and misrepresentation of the image. While the image itself might show Trump with Carroll in a different picture (if sourced correctly), the caption explicitly references a *viral* image identified as being of Jill Harth. This misidentification is a significant error, rendering the claim based on this specific image out of context. Therefore, considering the external evidence, which corroborates the misidentification and casts doubt on the central claim of the caption, the overall verdict is that the caption is out of context.  The confidence score is lowered to reflect the uncertainty introduced by the conflicting information and the importance of verifying the identity of individuals in images before drawing conclusions about their relationships.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the presence of Trump and Carroll in the image, but external validation reveals the viral image referenced is misidentified as Jill Harth, rendering the caption's claim out of context. The external evidence carries greater weight due to its verification of image authenticity and broader contextual awareness."

        "content": "An abandoned quarry in Nigeria has become a tourist hotspot after images were posted on social media earlier this month.\nThe rocky cliffs climbing into a blue sky, a moss-lined footpath, small green hills and a lake that shimmers in the sun are quite breath-taking and a set of images shared on Twitter at the beginning of August has been liked more than a thousand times.\nIn a matter of days of the post, the site, known as Crushed Rock, in Mpape - a poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of the capital Abuja - was thronged.\nThere has been a DJ stand, food vendors, hundreds of sun-bathing selfie-takers - and even a band of classical musicians.\nNigerians are not generally known to be outdoor lovers - the weather is very hot in the north and quite humid in the south.\nHowever, there is a burgeoning community of hikers around Abuja inspired by the many expatriates living in the political capital.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also had a part to play in encouraging these young middle-class Nigerians to explore the hills in the country's rocky central region.\nThe lockdown, which prevented people from travelling elsewhere, has meant that places closer to home are being explored.\nThe area around Mpape, which means \"rock\" in the local Gwari language, supplied much of the stone used to transform Abuja from a small village in the 1980s into the country's capital city.\n\"The quarry has existed for more than 10 years,\" said Mpape resident Courage Ebenz, who is somewhat bemused by the sudden influx of city-dwellers.\nNigeria has an abundance of sites of natural beauty, but this \"man-made\" location has its own appeal - with three main tiers that each give a stunning view of the water below.\nSightseers can choose a small winding footpath to the top terrace, where the grass is an ideal picnic location.\nThe more adventurous can continue down the path that circles and snakes down to the water's edge.\nBut a warning for the brave who might want to plunge into the water - the locals say it is full of abandoned machinery.\nAccording to Abraham Adepelumi, a geo-physicist at Obafemi Awolowo university, the lake was formed as a result of the fracturing of an aquifer.\n\"Once the rock got fractured, the water within the rock was under pressure,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It is a natural phenomenon, Mpape is a fracture-prone area of Abuja and has experienced tremors as recent as 2018.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nThe local emergency agency has warned amateurs against hiking at Mpape Crushed Rock, but fun-seekers seem not to be deterred.\n\"I didn't know we had such a place in Nigeria and I wanted to see if it is real,\" Elizabeth Okute, who came with her friends after seeing pictures on Facebook, told the BBC.\n\"I am surprised such a place exists in Abuja and I love what I am seeing,\" said Ann Chukwuka.\nEmeka Uko, who kept straying to the edge much to the chagrin of his friends, added: \"I hope we put measures in place to preserve it.\"\nThis is exactly what some volunteers decided to do last Saturday, clearing up a trail of plastic waste around the quarry that has built up over the last few weeks.\nThey split into two groups to compete to see who could collect the most rubbish - updating social media as they went.\n\"A lot of people felt it was their responsibility to clean up the place,\" Brandon Akume, whose group came second in the clean-up dash, told the BBC.\nThis was an alien concept to most Nigerians, he added.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption \"Ann Chukwuka at Mpape Crushed Rock near Abuja, Nigeria\". The internal check finds a high degree of confidence (score of 10) because the image clearly shows a woman who visually matches the description of Ann Chukwuka at a location consistent with Mpape Crushed Rock.  The external check further corroborates this with a confidence score of 10, citing a news source that directly quotes Ann Chukwuka confirming her presence at the location.  There are no discrepancies or uncertainties between the internal and external checks; both independently and congruently confirm the caption's accuracy.  The visual evidence aligns perfectly with the textual information, presenting no signs of manipulation or miscontextualization. The presence of other individuals in the background of the image adds to the contextual validity, showing a real-life scene and not a staged photograph. The high confidence scores (10/10 in both checks) reinforce the strong evidence supporting the caption's accuracy.  There's no indication of visual tampering; the image seems naturally captured, strengthening the trust in the information presented.  The visual details, including the landscape, the woman's attire and the other people present, are consistent with the caption and the supporting external source.  In summary, the robust alignment between the visual image, the internal analysis, and the external verification makes it highly improbable that the caption is out of context. Therefore, the conclusion is definitive and confident in the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks provide strong support for the caption's accuracy with perfect confidence scores.  No inconsistencies were found; visual evidence aligns with textual and external source information."

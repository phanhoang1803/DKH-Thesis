It has been shared with text that says: Mexican official being dragged by the caravan. Anyone up for open borders??\nBut thats not true. The photo doesnt show migrants who are currently traveling north from Central America. It shows protestors during a clash with police in 2014. That demonstration had followed the disappearance, and suspected massacre, of 43 students in the Mexican city of Iguala. The clash with police in the photo happened in Acapulco.\nThis isnt the first time that an old photo has been paired with misinformation about the so-called caravan. Earlier we wrote about three old photos  one showed a bloodied officer from 2012; one showed an officer with a bloody nose from 2011; one showed an officer kneeling during another demonstration about the missing student teachers in 2014. Those three unrelated photos were circulating with this bogus claim: Mexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico  And WE are supposed to believe these are just poor, helpless refugees seeking asylum???\nAlthough the photos have been shared thousands of times on Facebook, they have nothing to do with the group of migrants who are currently in the news.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\n2,300 migrant children in Central American caravan need protection, UNICEF says.

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows a high degree of confidence (8/10) that the caption accurately reflects the image's central action: a police officer being forcefully pulled by a crowd.  However, the external validation presents strong evidence (10/10) contradicting the caption's claim that the individuals involved are \"Caravan members.\"  External sources state that the photograph depicts a 2014 protest in Mexico following the disappearance of 43 students, not members of a migrant caravan. This directly contradicts the caption's assertion.  The visual evidence itself doesn't definitively identify the group's affiliation; while it shows a police officer being forcefully removed from a crowd, it lacks information on their identity or affiliation. The internal validation's focus on the core action of the image (a police officer being dragged) is correct, but fails to account for the crucial contextual error regarding the group's identity. Because the external validation provides concrete evidence contradicting a key element of the caption, and the image provides no visual clues to support the caption's specific claim of the group's identity, the overall conclusion is that the caption is out of context.  The discrepancy between internal and external validation highlights the importance of verifying image captions with reliable external sources. While the image's core action is captured correctly, the caption's context is entirely false and misleading.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the depiction of a police officer being dragged, but external validation strongly refutes the claim that these are \"Caravan members.\"  External sources identify the image as depicting a 2014 protest in Mexico unrelated to a migrant caravan, thus rendering the caption out of context."

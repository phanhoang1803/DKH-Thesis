    "confidence_score": 3,
    "explanation": "The image shows a damaged bridge and a crowd of people gathered on a hillside. The scene suggests a potential disaster, but there is no evidence in the image itself to confirm the number of deaths (13) or the precise location (Anyama, near Abidjan). The caption's claim of 13 deaths lacks visual support within the image. The internal validation check highlights the lack of visual confirmation for the death toll and location specifics.  The external check points to the plausibility of a violent incident causing multiple fatalities in the region but emphasizes the absence of verifiable information, such as the date of the event, the event type, and a reliable source.  The geographical location of Anyama near Abidjan is consistent, but this alone does not verify the caption. Both the internal and external checks agree on the lack of sufficient evidence to confirm the caption's details. The discrepancy lies in the level of confidence; the internal check is less confident than the external check, but both agree on the lack of confirmation, leaning towards 'out of context'.  The absence of visual cues related to the number of casualties (bodies, emergency responders) makes it impossible to verify the stated death toll from the image alone.  Furthermore, there's no text or other visual markers in the photo to explicitly confirm the location.  Therefore, based on the lack of supporting visual evidence and the absence of corroborating information, the caption is deemed out of context.  The low confidence score reflects the limited information available for a conclusive assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations agree that the caption lacks sufficient evidence. The image shows a damaged bridge and a crowd but provides no details on casualties or location to corroborate the caption's claim of 13 deaths in Anyama, near Abidjan. The external check notes the plausibility of such an event but highlights the lack of specific verifiable details.  The overall assessment is that the caption is out of context due to insufficient evidence."

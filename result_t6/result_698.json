        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows an F-18 Super Hornet breaking the sound barrier and creating a sonic boom.\nIn March 2021, Snopes readers asked about a video circulating on social media that showed a fighter jet blasting by an audience on a beach, along with commentary claiming the aircraft broke the sound barrier, as evidenced by a disc-shaped cloud that formed around it:\nThe video shows a flyby by an F-18 Super Hornet at the annual Bethpage Air Show, which took place over Jones Beach in New York in 2009.\nAlthough an F-18 Super Hornet is certainly capable of supersonic flight, the air show pilots didn't break the sound barrier. In another video from the same air show, the announcer can be heard informing the crowd that the plane is close to the speed of sound, but the pilots were careful not to surpass it:\nAs the announcer explained, that's because the resulting sonic boom would be so powerful that it would leave a wave of destruction. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) bans most supersonic flight over or near land.\nAs anyone who lives in the flight path of a space shuttle has learned by experience, sonic booms are not only extremely loud, they cause the ground to shake.\nIn 2014, a U.S. Navy F-18 jet flying over the Pacific Ocean about 35 miles southwest of San Diego went supersonic. The resulting sonic boom led residents miles away in Orange and Los Angeles counties to believe they had experienced an earthquake. The sonic boom from a meteor that struck the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 also caused widespread damage.\nSonic booms are shock waves from air pressure and occur when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, which depending on various conditions, is about 761 mph.\nAlthough some posts and comments on social media indicated that viewers believed the circular cloud that formed around the F-18 at the 2009 air show was evidence of the plane going supersonic, it's not. The cloud is known as a vapor cone, or sometimes called a \"shock collar\" or \"shock egg,\" per the BBC, which published an explainer on the phenomenon in 2016.\nThe cone forms when airplanes approach the speed of sound, particularly if they are flying low over water. Even so, it's not visual evidence that the plane is breaking the sound barrier, per the BBC:\nThe vapour cones are created by a shockwave that is generated by the aircraft as it picks up speed. The shock waves are the physical effects of the aircraft travelling so fast through air. As the aircraft picks up speed, and approaches the speed of sound  around 767mph (1,234km/h) at sea level  shockwaves form around the aircraft. Across these shockwaves there is discontinuity in the local air pressure and temperature. This causes the air to lose its capacity to hold water and condensation starts to form, creating the vapour cone.\nThe BBC also noted that the visual effect can be more dramatic when some of the air flowing around parts of the plane actually do pick up speeds faster than sound, an event known as a \"transonic\" flight.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both strongly support the accuracy of the news caption.  The internal check notes the clear depiction of an F-18 Super Hornet in the image, aligning with the caption's statement. While the image alone cannot verify the location or event (Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach, NY), the aircraft identification is crucial and accurately presented. The external check provides direct corroboration, stating that a video indeed shows an F-18 Super Hornet flyby at the Bethpage Air Show over Jones Beach in New York in 2009. This directly aligns with and expands upon the information in the original news caption.  There are no discrepancies or uncertainties between the internal and external checks.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) further reinforce the conclusion that the caption accurately reflects the image's content, and there is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The image shows an F-18 Super Hornet performing a flyby, exhibiting a vapor cone indicative of high speed. This is entirely consistent with a performance at an air show. The lack of any contradictory information in the image, combined with the strong external validation, leads to a high confidence level in the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the caption's accuracy. The image shows an F-18 Super Hornet, matching the caption, and external sources confirm the aircraft's presence at the specified air show."

    "explanation": "The internal validation strongly supports the caption, indicating high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image clearly shows a view of Singapore's Kallang Basin from a window, aligning perfectly with the caption's description.  However, the external validation contradicts this assessment, stating that the evidence retrieved does not support the caption and provides no corroborating information. This discrepancy significantly lowers the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy. The external validation's lack of supporting evidence weakens its assessment.  Without additional reliable external sources confirming or refuting the caption's claim of a quiet evening over Kallang Basin, we cannot definitively state its accuracy. Therefore, the final verdict leans towards the caption being out of context due to the lack of external corroboration. A higher confidence score would require stronger external validation supporting the description of a quiet evening in the specific location and time suggested.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, showing a clear view of Kallang Basin from a window. External validation fails to find any supporting evidence, leading to a significant contradiction.  Overall, the lack of external support makes it difficult to confirm the description of a quiet evening."

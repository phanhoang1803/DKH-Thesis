        "content": "A police officer and a civilian have been killed in the Nigerian city of Lagos as protests continue against police brutality for a sixth day.\nThere are reports that police used live ammunition on the protesters in the country's largest city.\nThis comes a day after a notorious police unit accused of unlawful arrests and murder was officially disbanded.\nDemonstrators have long called for the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) to be broken up.\nBut they remain unhappy following Sunday's announcement that officers are being redeployed to other units rather than being disciplined.\nEyewitnesses say there were multiple casualties among protesters after police opened fire on them in the Surulere area of Lagos on Monday, the BBC's Ishaq Khalid reports from the capital, Abuja.\nSome of the demonstrators reportedly threw stones at the police. The police say one officer was killed and two others were critically injured by what they called ''armed protesters''.\nMeanwhile, Lagos police and protesters blame each other for the death of a 55-year-old man.\nAn aide to President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the use of live bullets on demonstrators by the police. There are reports that armed trucks have been deployed to Lagos airport to break up protests blocking access to the airport.\nEarlier, the president promised \"extensive\" police reforms and said Sars officers responsible for human rights violations would be brought to justice.\nBut the latest alleged use of live bullets by the police on protesters could further anger campaigners and lend more credence to their grievances, our correspondent says.\nIn Monday's video address, President Buhari said disbanding Sars was \"only the first step\" in a range of reforms, but added that police officers were hard-working, and the reputation of the force should not be tarnished by a \"few bad eggs\".\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose accept and continue.\nThere are also fears that if thousands of Sars officers were dismissed at once, they could pose a security threat.\nActivists say the abuses carried out during the protests - including beatings, intimidation and the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators - were all carried out by policemen who did not belong to Sars.\nThey say a total overhaul of policing in Nigeria is needed.\nOver the weekend, protests against Sars spread to Europe and Canada after reports of unlawful arrests, torture and shootings.\nWhat do the protesters want?\n#EndSARS campaigners have circulated a list of five key demands to bring about reform. These are:\nThe immediate release of all arrested protesters\nJustice for those killed by police brutality and compensation for their families\nAn independent body to investigate and prosecute misconduct\nIndependent psychological assessments and new training for dismissed Sars officers who want redeployment\nA pay rise for police so they are \"adequately compensated for protecting lives and property of citizens\"\nHow did Sars operate?\nThe latest round of protests were prompted by footage of officers pulling two men out of a hotel in Lagos into the street and shooting one of them.\nThe footage, leaked to the media, provoked outrage and led many to share stories of brutality attributed to the unit, which has developed notoriety for unduly profiling young people, the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja says.\nThose considered \"flashy\" often attract the Sars officers' attention and very few walk away without having to hand over money, while others are arrested or jailed on trumped-up charges and some have been killed, our correspondent adds.\nEarlier this year, rights group Amnesty said it had documented at least 82 cases of torture, ill treatment and extra-judicial execution between January 2017 and May this year.\nThe victims were mainly men aged between 18 and 35 from poor backgrounds and vulnerable groups. Many of those tortured were beaten with sticks and machetes and denied medical attention, the group said.\nThe \"systemic use of torture... points to an absolute disregard for international human rights laws and standards\", Amnesty said.\nWhy didn't reform work?\nThe #EndSARS hashtag was first thought to have been used in 2018, but it emerged once again a week ago.\nDecember 2017: Outcry prompts Nigeria's then-police chief, Ibrahim Idris, to order an immediate re-organisation of the anti-robbery unit in the aftermath of a viral video showing a young man allegedly killed by police\nAugust 2018: Acting President Yemi Osinbajo orders an overhaul of Sars, wanting a new unit whose officers would wear proper identification while on duty. He also asks the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria to create a special panel to investigate previous wrongdoing by Sars\nJanuary 2019: Newly appointed Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu announces a comprehensive reform of Sars and temporarily decentralises the unit. Rights group Amnesty says the reforms do not go far enough for citizens to trust the police\nFebruary 2020: Police boss Mohammed Adamu gives instructions to disband Sars' satellite offices",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Based on the combined results of internal and external validation, the caption \"Protesters blocked a road leading to the airport in Lagos on Oct. 12.\" is deemed to be largely accurate, although not entirely precise. The internal validation provides strong support. The image clearly shows a protest occurring at an airport access point in Lagos. The signage \"AIRPORT ACCESS PLAZA\" leaves no ambiguity regarding the location. This gives a confidence score of 10 for the internal check.  The external validation, however, offers slightly weaker support. The source mentions reports of protests blocking airport access and the deployment of armed trucks, implying a significant protest and road blockage at Lagos airport around October 12. This aligns with the caption but lacks explicit confirmation of a road blockage *leading* to the airport on that specific date. This results in a confidence score of 8 for the external check. While there's a slight discrepancy regarding the specific wording (\"a road leading to\" vs. general \"airport access\"), both the internal visual evidence and the external report point to the same event: a protest causing significant disruption to airport access in Lagos around October 12.  The image shows a substantial number of protesters and the location is visibly at an airport access point. The difference in wording doesn't negate the core message.  Therefore, the caption is not entirely out of context. The overall confidence score is weighted slightly more towards the strong internal validation, but we acknowledge a minor uncertainty based on the less precise external source. The slight difference is considered to be inconsequential; the core statement remains aligned. There is no evidence of image manipulation or misrepresentation. The visual evidence directly corresponds to the event described in the caption, and the external report adds contextual support, even though it is not perfectly explicit.  Considering both evidence forms, we conclude that the caption's inaccuracy is minimal and does not make the statement misleading or substantially out of context. This leads to a final confidence score of 9.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, with a confidence score of 10. External validation provides supporting evidence but is less precise, resulting in a score of 8. The overall assessment is that the caption is largely accurate, though not perfectly precise, with a combined confidence score of 9."

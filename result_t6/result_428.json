        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a soldier carrying a donkey on his back during World War II to prevent the animal from inadvertently setting off landmines.\nAn amusing and unusual photograph of what appears to be a soldier transporting a donkey on his back was circulated in March 2020 during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The picture served as a sort of parable about the need to prevent people who are oblivious to danger from causing harm to others through their ignorance  a pointed reference to the faltering responses of some governments in dealing with the pandemic. The caption accompanying the photograph stated that the picture dated from World War II and captured a soldier carrying the animal in order to keep it from inadvertently tripping landmines and killing everyone around it:\nThis picture [is] from World War II, a soldier carrying a donkey. It is not that the soldier loves donkeys or has some sort of perversion. What's happening is that the field is mined and that if the donkey was free to wander as it pleased, it would likely detonate a charge and kill everyone. The moral of the story is that during difficult times the first ones you have to keep under control are the jackasses who don't understand the danger and do as they please.\nHowever much truth that parable may hold, it isn't directly applicable to this picture, which has nothing to do with World War II, or landmines, or any danger the donkey might have posed had it been allowed to run free.\nThe picture actually dates from 1958, during the Algerian War (i.e., a war for independence waged against French forces in Colonial Algeria). And it depicts a starving donkey that was rescued by a member of the French Foreign Legion who carried it back to his base, where the animal was nursed back to health, given the name \"Bambi,\" and adopted as a unit mascot  as described by author Douglas Porch in his 1991 history of the Legion:\nNineteen fifty-eight proved a very successful year for the Legion in another respect -- it was awarded a Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and a similar recognition from the RSPCA in London, after a legionnaire of the 13e DBLE [13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion] rescued a starving donkey and returned it to his base where, renamed Bambi, it served the unit as a mascot. Interest was pricked among the \"Anglo-Saxons\" after London's Daily Mail carried a photo of the donkey being carried on the back of a legionnaire. Attempts to award the Certificate of Merit to the generous legionnaire foundered upon [his maintaining anonymity]. However, the Chief Secretary of the RSPCA was informed by the Legion that numerous mascots, \"running from the bear to the lizard, passing through monkeys, sand foxes, storks and other birds, hedgehogs, without forgetting of course the multitude of dogs and cats [that] follow each unit in its movements. In certain [units], the number of animals is greater than the strength in manpower.\" Especially gratifying was the knowledge that Bambi \"at the present time is enjoying an enviable destiny and that he is sharing the life of our legionnaires and even ... their beer.\"\nDonkeys may create dangerous situations (unwittingly or otherwise) in other circumstances, but not in the one captured in the photograph displayed above.",

While the caption states the photo depicts a WWII soldier carrying a donkey to avoid landmines, Snopes asserts the photo is from the Algerian War of 1958 and shows a soldier rescuing a starving donkey, not preventing it from triggering mines.  The original caption accompanying the photo is also mentioned, which was not related to landmines.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows some confidence in the caption's plausibility, noting the wartime setting and the possibility of using a donkey to avoid landmines. However, the external validation provides strong evidence contradicting the caption. The Snopes.com source indicates that the photograph is from the Algerian War of 1958, depicting a soldier rescuing a starving donkey, not a World War II soldier using the donkey to avoid landmines. The discrepancy lies in the timeframe and the reason for the soldier carrying the donkey. The internal validation's confidence is primarily based on visual cues suggestive of a wartime scene, which is consistent with both World War II and the Algerian War. The context provided by Snopes.com is crucial here, offering a concrete alternative explanation based on verifiable information.  Visual inspection of the image doesn't definitively exclude the possibility of landmines, but it also doesn't provide conclusive evidence supporting the presence of landmines.  The uniforms appear consistent with a military setting of the mid-20th century; however, the resolution is too low for precise identification. The external source provides additional context by referencing the original caption, which further weakens the claim presented in the news caption. Because the external source provides credible information contradicting the news caption's claim, and because that information is more specific than the inference provided by the internal check, the external source should be prioritized.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because it misrepresents the photo's origin, the conflict it depicts, and the soldier's reason for carrying the donkey.  The confidence score of 7 reflects the uncertainty stemming from limited visual detail but is weighted more heavily in favor of the external validation due to the reputable source used.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation suggests plausibility but lacks definitive proof. External validation strongly contradicts the caption's claims, citing a reputable source that identifies the photo's origin and context.  The external evidence is more specific and credible, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

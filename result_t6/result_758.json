The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence (score 10) that the image accurately reflects the caption's mention of \"Disney\", \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\", and Kate Winslet.  However, the external validation check decisively contradicts this, providing strong evidence (score 10) that the claim is false.  Snopes' fact-check reveals the poster is fan-made, and Disney has not announced any such remake.  The discrepancy highlights a crucial point: internal consistency within the image itself does not guarantee the accuracy of the associated caption. While the image visually supports the caption's elements, external evidence definitively proves the caption's claim regarding a Disney announcement is untrue.  The visual evidence, therefore, is misrepresentative of the actual situation because it originates from a fan-made source and not an official Disney announcement. There is no visual tampering evident; the poster's quality suggests it is a professionally made fan artwork. However, the miscontextualization stems from the poster's presentation as representing an official Disney announcement when it does not. Given the high confidence of the external validation's refutation based on credible sources and the internal validation's reliance solely on visual evidence (which could be fabricated), the external evidence takes precedence.  Therefore, the caption is out-of-context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation suggests a high match between the image and caption elements. However, external validation (Snopes) strongly refutes the caption's claim of an official Disney announcement, revealing the image to be a fan-made creation. The external evidence outweighs internal visual analysis and demonstrates that the caption is out of context."

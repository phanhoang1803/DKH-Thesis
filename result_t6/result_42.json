It was the areas first volcanic eruption in nearly 800 years.\nOn Tuesday, Icelands civil protection officials were seen gesturing to dozens of people to move away from lava just meters behind them to ensure visitors do not get hurt. One of the officials said a visitor tried to cook bacon and eggs on the lava  but the pan melted in the heat.\nItalian photographer Vincenzo Mazza, who lives in Iceland, was one of those who got a close look at the slow-flowing lava.\nIve been waiting for many years to see an eruption in Iceland, he said. I saw some eruptions in Italy, like Etna and Stromboli, but this is absolutely different.\nI cant say this is more beautiful than that because they are very different, but this lava glowing just so close to us, its insane, Mazza said.\nThe glow from the lava could be seen from the outskirts of Icelands capital, Reykjavk, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) away.\nIcelandic officials said they did not anticipate evacuations because the volcano is in a remote area, about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the nearest road.",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the news caption.  The internal check found the caption consistent with the image, noting the clear depiction of a volcanic eruption in Iceland and a large crowd of people observing it. The high confidence score (10) reflects the straightforward and unambiguous visual evidence.  The external check further solidified this assessment.  It cited a news source that directly corroborates the caption by reporting on a volcanic eruption near Reykjavik, Iceland, attracting large crowds.  The external check also scored a high confidence level (10), indicating strong agreement with the caption's statement. There were no discrepancies between the internal and external validation results. The image shows no signs of visual tampering or miscontextualization. Visual details, such as the crowd size and the erupting volcano, align perfectly with the information provided in the caption and supporting external source.  Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the caption's accuracy or question its contextual relevance to the image. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) further strengthen the conclusion that the caption is not out of context.",

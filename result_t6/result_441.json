        "content": "Welcome, readers!\nPlease join us for live discussion and analysis about the final round of voting for the French presidential election.\nVoters will be choosing between two politicians with radically different views on core issues in an election that will define the future of France  and of Europe.\nThree of our bureau chiefs  Alissa J. Rubin in Paris, Alison Smale in Berlin and Steven Erlanger in London  will join us to discuss the election, along with our correspondents Liz Alderman and Amanda Taub, and Susan Chira, a senior editor and correspondent on gender issues.\nIll be guiding the discussion.\nWe welcome your questions for our correspondents about the French election. We will answer a selection of them as France heads to the polls.\nAs we await Sundays voting, we recommend you read Liz Alderman and Elian Peltiers story about where Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen stand on the issues.\nHello, Im Alissa J. Rubin, the Paris bureau chief, and I am in our office today in Paris.\nHi, Im Adam Nossiter, a correspondent in Paris.\nHi Alissa and Adam. As of 5 p.m. in France, turnout was 65.30 percent  lower than at this point in the last three presidential elections. Is this a concern for Emmanuel Macron?\nHi, I dont think it will make a big difference, although it does signal some of the problems Mr. Macron will confront, assuming he wins as predicted.\nYou two have been talking to voters nonstop these last few days. What were your impressions today? How often did the hacking come up?\nHacking didnt come up. French voters dont think it is important.\nWell, to my surprise, no one brought it up spontaneously, and if asked about it, they would shrug. But there was a silence period in place, so there was less information about it in the French media.\nHowever, I dont think it is as big an issue here as in the United States, and normal people just seemed kind of tired of hearing about the election.\nInteresting. The hacking certainly injected an element of surprise in the final hours of a campaign season that has been anything but predictable.\nBut it also occurred, as Alissa says, before a government-imposed blackout on information that might interfere with the election. So was it too late to matter?\nIn many ways though, I think the hacking was the least of it for the French.\nThere is no print blackout and neither Le Monde nor the Journal du Dimanche made a big deal out of the hacking. At this stage, it is just not important to the French.\nYes, I think it came too late. Whoever did the hacking appears to have wanted to affect the elections, but it didnt diffuse into the mainstream media fast enough to beat the news blackout deadline. In contrast, the fact that the two candidates in the runoff were not from mainstream parties was quite remarkable and a first for France.\nIn addition almost 20 percent of voters supported another non-mainstream party on the far left. France Insoumise or Unbowed France. So about 65 percent of voters in the first round were supporting non-mainstream parties  suggesting that they were tired of the status quo.\nAlissa and Adam, can you tell us more about the major issues French voters are deciding on today?\nHow to fix the economy, which is stuck at a permanent 10 percent unemployment and 1 percent growth, not enough to generate jobs. How to change everything without touching one comma of Frances web of social protections  in other words, the impossible.\nAdam, you point to a contradiction at the heart of French politics.\nThe country seems to want salvation but without reform.\nI agree with Adam: Creating more jobs was the central issue, but so was preserving the social safety net, which is much larger and more complete than the one in the United States.\nIf the economic difficulties you describe continue, does that just mean Marine Le Pen will win in the next election, in 2022?\nNo, it does not mean that, Sewell. It means the French will likely just muddle along. And Marine Le Pen is even more discredited now than before, after her aggressive and disastrous debate performance last week.\nLets talk about that debate for a moment.\nAdam, you described it as more like an angry American-style television shoutfest than the reasoned discussion of issues the French have become accustomed to.\nWhat do you think most voters took away from it?\nThat Marine Le Pen lacks substance and her so-called undemonization strategy is a sham  in other words, she re-demonized herself.\nConcerning the debate, I also heard from people that they disliked the tone, mostly Marine Le Pens tone, but also, at the beginning, Macrons tone, which was combative as well.\nHowever, he showed that he was able to be tough in a debate, and his first debate performance before the first round had been rather weak.\nFor readers just joining us: Polls in France will start to close in about 40 minutes, in one of the most consequential presidential elections in many years.\nFacing each other in this run-off election are Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister whos been endorsed by Barack Obama, and Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist whose dark portrayal of France has left some observers comparing her to Donald J. Trump. (She doesnt embrace that comparison.)\nAlissa Rubin and Adam Nossiter, our foreign correspondents based in Paris, are telling us what it means, and will also be taking questions from readers.\nThis will be the first time since the start of the Fifth Republic  1958!  that the president will NOT be from either of the major parties.\nWhat does that mean for French democracy  and democracy in the West more generally? Voters from the U.S., Britain and elsewhere have been losing faith with mainstream parties.\nFrench voters rightly saw that neither of the mainstream parties had solutions for Frances problems. So they threw them out. But French voters are not American voters. They want someone in office with demonstrated competence over the issues, and knowledge about them.\nReaders are asking about exit polling, and when thatll be available. Alissa, your thoughts?\nAfter the polls close, the polling institutes publish projections based on the preliminary results they have access to from a group of polling places. So its projections based on a limited number of real results.\nIn the first round last month, it was roughly accurate, but because it was so close, the numbers changed several times putting different candidates 1 percent ahead.\nFrom a Reader\nHow quickly does the winner assume office?\nOn or before May 14.\nAdams earlier point about competence and knowledge of the system is key, and many people who watch politics here believe that Franois Fillon, who came in third, would have beaten Macron simply because Fillon is a former prime minister with a long track record in politics. Im not sure if thats right. Adam may have a better read on that. Fillon was defeated largely because of a nepotism scandal that led to embezzlement charges.\nFrom a Reader\nDans quelle mesure l'attitude des tats-Unis et de Donald Trump envers la France serait diffrente en fonction d'une victoire de Le Pen ou Macron ?\nPierre is asking whether the election of Marine Le Pen or Macron will make a difference in the U.S. attitudes. Thoughts?\nTrump bien entendu serait plus favorable  Mme Le Pen. Il lui a dj exprim son soutien. Macron pour sa part ne cache pas son mepris pour M. Trump!\nAdam says: Trump would of course be more favorable to Ms. Le Pen. He has already expressed his support. Macron for his part does not hide his contempt for Mr. Trump!\nFrom a Reader\nHi Alissa, Adam. Last year, we saw how the Russian government tried to influence the election by leaking Hillary Clintons hacked emailed through Wikileaks. This incident with Macron seems eerily familiar. Does U.S. or French intelligence know the source of these leaks yet? And how much do you think they will influence the election, especially because Macron cannot legally make a statement about their validity or lack thererof?\nHi Bill, I dont think theres any official information yet on the origin of the hacking and leaks of the Macron emails and campaign documents. More may emerge next week.\nFrom a Reader\nTo what degree do you feel the thinly-veiled anti-Semitism of Le Pen will play a role in motivating French voters to support or reject her candidacy? Her emphasis in the debate on Macrons work for the Rothschilds was nothing if not an effort to dredge up the right-wings historical anti-Semitism, but in a contemporary context.\nIt is hard to tell how much the anti-Semitism bothers the French. What seems clear is that it is a thinly veiled code that her supporters recognize and approve of and that helps her solidify her base.\nFor me as an American watching a French election for the first time, what is striking is that there is such widespread distrust of bankers and overall of wealthy people, and many French would prefer a career politician who has never held a real job.\nNearly half of French voters in the first round voted for candidates who are explicitly anti-free market and anti-capitalism.\nFrom a Reader\nNo matter who wins, the French President will likely have to deal with a National Assembly and Parliament that is not made up of a majority of their party. What do you think are some of the biggest obstacles ahead for Macron or Le Pen if they cannot reach a parliamentary majority in June?\nIts very difficult for French presidents to propose and pass their program if they lack a working majority. However, Macron is something of an anomaly because he might have more luck getting his pro-market economic program passed with a Republican majority in the Parliament than with a more left-leaning majority. The left are defenders of the social programs and a more state-supervised economy.\nFor Marine Le Pen, I think it would be very difficult for her to get a majority from the Parliament because she is likely to be so far to the right of most Parliament members.\nA final question for Alissa and Adam before they leave us to file their stories:\nA lot of American readers have been intrigued by Ms. Le Pens use of Trump-like messages, and Mr. Obamas support for Mr. Macron. Do the French see this comparison as meaningful?\nI am not sure how meaningful it is here in France. After all, Marine Le Pen differs considerably from President Trump in terms of her view of the role of government. She wants a strong social welfare system that if anything gives more to French workers. A government that protects its citizens is one of her standard campaign promises.\nI also think that Trump is seen as having had a chaotic first few months and the French like to see experience in their leaders. As for Obama and Macron, I thought it was perhaps useful to have a world leader (former world leader) give him a vote of confidence precisely because he is young and inexperienced in government. But, I rather doubt it will win him any votes.\nYes, Alissa is right  the French dont care what American leaders think/dont think about their candidates! But they do dislike Trump!\nMany thanks to Alissa and Adam for joining us.\nThank you.\nOur next guests: my colleagues Steven Erlanger and Susan Chira, who are both here in London (along with your host).\nBonjour, bon soir! Im Steven Erlanger, the bureau chief in London and formerly the same in Paris, and I covered the last French presidential election.\nI just want to start with a note of appreciation for our colleagues in France  especially Alissa Rubin, Adam Nossiter and Aurelien Breeden  for their terrific work so far on this election.\nHi, Im Susan Chira, senior correspondent for gender issues. For many years, I was the foreign editor of The Times, so Ive observed French elections in the past, along with my colleagues.\nIve just arrived in London today having spent last week in Paris, writing about Marine Le Pen and how she has skillfully used gender to help normalize the National Front and broaden its appeal to women.\nSusan, youve written a lot on gender in both the U.S. and the French elections:\nWhat do you make of Ms. Le Pens portrayal of herself as, in effect, a protective mother of the nation?\nI was in Paris last week doing interviews, and I think shes been extremely smart, politically. Sociologists who study the French electorate say that the way shes framed her campaign has helped to normalize her image and connect with women who see her as a mother, working woman, and protector, as you note.\nIn the 2012 elections, as Nonna Mayer, a sociologist at Sciences Po, has written, the gender gap in voters for the National Front virtually disappeared, and in this campaign Ms. Le Pen has been even more insistent on playing the woman card, going so far as to pose in her campaign poster in a short skirt, which her aides depicted as a message that women  French and Muslim women  can wear whatever they want. So it emphasized femininity as well as echoing the Islamophobic strands of the National Front.\nBut of course we will have to study the results of this election to see how well the strategy worked; Ms. Mayer said that the runoff results were not available yet for analysis.\nIm struck by the Le Pen family drama.\nMarine Le Pen very publicly broke with her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the far-right National Front in 1972. Hes a convicted Holocaust denier, among other things.\nAnd she nearly got blown up as a child when someone tried to kill her father, while her mother divorced him and posed for Playboy. Not an easy childhood.\nMoreover, her niece, Marion Marchal Le Pen, is seen as a rising star in the National Front.\nYes, many of the people I spoke with said that her niece has actually positioned herself to the right of Marine Le Pen.\nShes got a tougher message on family planning, abortion and other hot-button issues.\nDysfunctional political dynasties arent unique to America I guess?\nAnd I believe that Marine was estranged from another of her sisters until recently, as well. So, yes, family dramas cross all boundaries.\nMarion, the young niece, is closer to the harder views of her father and the French south, while Marine reflects more of the north, and has worked very hard to make the National Front acceptable to Jews and gays.\nPolitical analysts of course note that Marine Le Pen had to separate herself from her father to broaden the appeal of her party. He was too toxic.\nFor folks just joining us: Polls have just started to close in much of France, in the most closely watched presidential election in decades. Marine Le Pen, from the far-right National Front, is facing Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister and an independent candidate, in a run-off election.\nContinuing our discussion of Marine Le Pen, she has many gay advisers and has supported some degree of gay rights. In addition, Ms. Mayer told me that Marine Le Pen has gained some more of the Jewish vote  obviously a minority still  because she has been so outspoken about Islam. And she has publicly accepted the reality of the Holocaust, unlike her father.\nAnd yet the Holocaust denial isnt going away as an issue, it seems.\nMarine Le Pen recently affirmed her view that France doesnt bear collective responsibility for the notorious 1942 round-up of Jews at the Vl d'Hiv stadium:\nAnd just after the first round of the election, she had to fire a campaign aide for comments HE is supposed to have made in 2000 (he has denied them):\nI once asked Marine Le Pen in 2010, I think, whether she had just replaced the Jews with the Muslims. She laughed and said, pratiquement.\nAnd as our colleague Adam Nossiter has written, there are still people in the party with ties to pro-Nazi groups.\nHeres the article by Adam, that Susan refers to:\nTheres a lot of interest in the far right among readers. Steves quip above got me wondering about the role of Islam in this election. Do you sense that its a deciding factor?\nFrom what I saw and heard in Paris, the level of concern about Islamic radicalism is high among segments of the French electorate. And of course Paris has been battered by terrorist incidents  but we must remember that many of these stemmed from French citizens who were radicalized in France, rather than immigrants.\nIslam wraps up three key issues in one too-handy label: 1. terrorism. 2. integration and secularism. 3. migration. Thats why the National Front gets so much mileage from its attacks on radical Islam.\nIndeed, at a Marine Le Pen rally, I was struck by the fervor of both her comments about returning France to its core values  which was a not very coded anti-immigrant message  and how the crowd was electrified by her portrait of herself as preserving French culture.\nIdentity has become a salient issue across Western democracies.\nAnd its intersected powerfully with economics, with people who feel left behind, by economic and cultural change:\nAbsolutely, Sewell, there is much resonance for someone like me who has spent a lot of time talking to those who voted for Donald J. Trump. I am not comparing him to Marine Le Pen, but immigration, protecting borders, a sense that American culture is under assault  there are parallels.\nMacron has said, There is not a French culture. There is a culture in France, and it is diverse.\nLe Pen, on the other hand, once said that to be French, one must eat French, speak French and even BREATHE French.\nSewell, Le Pen has also said she has no issue with those who accept French identity and values. More coded language of course.\nThe French are especially concerned about the challenge a vibrant Islam represents to a country based on lacit, or secularism, in which everyone is a citizen, supposedly without race, gender or religion.\nAbsolutely, Steve. Lacit is such a powerful concept for the French, and it contrasts with the American sense that is not offended, generally, if someone wears a veil in public.\nOr other signs of religious affiliation.\nA well-known Muslim cleric in the banlieues or suburbs of Paris told me he felt freer to live as a Muslim in the monarchy of Britain, with its established religion, than in the republic of France. He exaggerates some, of course, but not altogether.\nLets shift the conversation to the economy.\nAs our colleague Adam Nossiter said earlier, unemployment in France seems permanently stuck around 10 percent.\nA lot of the experts seem to agree on the prescriptions  including greater flexibility in hiring and firing, lower regulations, greater public investments  but the reforms seem to have eluded mainstream parties and politicians for many years now. What explains that, and will this time be different?\nWell, many things. The unions are small, less than 10 percent of the workforce, but they control the commanding heights of the economy and can do a lot to shut down transport, oil refineries, etc.\nSo change means facing down prolonged strike action. The French have an excellent social welfare system, which is expensive, and they dont want their health care or pension rights reduced. Nor do they much want to work much past 60  many retire at 55.\nA question thats been nagging at me is that Macron is proposing some fairly fundamental changes in what has been a stagnant French economy. But in the past, such measures have set off nationwide protest and strikes. Is France ready to accept structural economic changes of the type Macron is proposing?\nI know that Steve has compared the experience of France with Germany, which took on challenging structural change many years back.\nSteve wrote about that topic a few years back:\nAnd, of course, theres the question that even if Macron wins, will he have the parliamentary support necessary to enact many changes?\nThe French state also absorbs about 56 percent of gross domestic product  very high, but the French dont want it to change  they like a state that protects and many have an aversion, from which Macron has felt the sting, to unbridled capitalism, especially bankers.\nYes, savage capitalism, I believe its been called.\nBut the current labor market is very unfair to young people, many of whom just get one temporary work contract after another, so miss out on many of those great benefits (which cost companies a lot) until theyre older. I did this story about it from Lille, which even had a video:\nIn their only debate, Le Pen portrayed Macron  a former Rothschild banker  as a heartless capitalist, who wants a war of all against all. Le Pens base  older, more rural, concentrated in the northeast and southeast of France  feels left out by globalization. Is her critique resonating?\nMy sense is that this is a real struggle in contemporary France. As Steve says, youth unemployment is high. But the critique of capitalism comes both from the left and the right. The right see themselves as abandoned. The left sees capitalism as heartless.\nSusan is right. Marine Le Pens critique resonates with those who feel left behind, those who have suffered from globalization and deindustrialization and the closure of mines and factories. But there is a cultural disgust for economic parasites and those who make money from money. Some associate it with a largely Roman Catholic culture, but it is a theme of the right and far-right for a century or more, and associated with all the issues around the Dreyfus affair  immigrants, Jews, and what it is to be French.\nAnd, of course, these themes of economic disenfranchisement resonate across Europe and the United States. Thats one reason this election is so interesting.\nSusan hits it again. There is a general reaction against what are the failures of the neo-liberal assumptions about the virtues of unbridled capitalism, globalization, the digital economy, with its emphasis on higher education and computer use. And against the multilateral institutions that seem to embody that ideology. Thats one reason why Macron is so interesting  he embraces it, in the face of Le Pens contempt for it.\nExactly. And one of the moments of suspense tonight in Europe is whether this disaffection will translate into lower turnout, because so many voters like neither candidate or what they embrace.\nThe criticism of globalization  what Jacques Attali I believe called Coca-colonization  began with the left, as an attack on American capitalist imperialism, but its embraced by the right. Thats where the two extremes meet happily.\nA lot of readers are asking: What are the results? Well, they havent come in yet  polls dont close in Frances large cities until 8 p.m., which is 2 p.m. ET  but we already have a results page here:\nSteve and Susan, lets pull back for a moment.\nWhat does this election mean for Europe, and how will the results be interpreted?\nIf Macron wins, some observers will no doubt say that the populist tide is waning.\nThe markets (like the polls) largely expect him to win, to be sure.\nIts a seminal moment, as we watch to see whether the wave of populist disaffection that played out in the United States and in the Brexit vote in Britain  the vote to leave the European Union  continues or falters.\nAnd in Germany, too, Angela Merkel seems to be restoring her popularity.\nYes, Steve, as you say. In the Dutch elections, there was a sense that momentum toward right-wing populism was slowing. But still, as in France, a sizeable percentage of the electorate opted for those ideas, so this resentment is not going away, whoever wins in France.\nBut we have to be careful of course  if this is a high-water mark for populism, the water is very very high indeed. Le Pen will do much better than her father did in a similar runoff in 2002  her party has a lot of support in the regions, and the criticism of established parties is rampant all over Europe.\nExactly the point I was also trying to make, Steve. These are issues that are not vanishing.\nAre we starting to see a positive case for globalization being made?\nI was struck that Le Pen and Macron had such starkly different messages at the Whirpool plant:\nYes, in France analysts were noting that Macron appeared somewhat clumsier as a politician. Marine Le Pen played the voters better. But Macrons message is that he cannot offer false reassurance  changes must be made.\nI think there has been some mainstream counter-reaction, after seeing the messy difficulties Britain has embraced with Brexit and the relative chaos and fumbling that has marked the beginning of the Trump administration in America. Populism is democracy, of course, but it has created a lot of cautionary anxiety.\nMacron has argued that globalization can still generate broad prosperity, even for less-educated manufacturing workers who have felt left out. Le Pen has made the case that Macron is a tool of global finance and of the European Union. (A memorable moment from the debate was when she told him: Either way, France will be ruled by a woman: me or Mrs. Merkel.)\nYes, Sewell, Macron has essentially argued that the future cannot be the past, and that France has to embrace the future with measured reforms (not as radical as Franois Fillon proposed) and an openness to the world.\nI think, as weve noted in the United States, economists and elites have not grappled hard enough with how to help those who suffer from open borders and global trade. It will be interesting to see economists in Europe and the U.S. make a case for globalization and how the upheavals it causes can be modulated.\nPopulists may have a hard time coming to power  but populist ideas dont seem to have slowed, have they?\nVoters have been skeptical about arguments for free movement of goods, money and (especially) people. Even if Macron wins tonight, wont that trend continue? In Europe, right-leaning populists are in charge of Poland and Hungary.\nI agree, Sewell, that the critique of globalism and the embrace of populism remain powerful.\nIn several countries in Europe, as you say.\nMy colleagues Max Fisher and Amanda Taub wrote about populisms awkward adolescence here:\nYes, the trend is there, and its combined with more nationalism, too, which is another response to globalization and fears of being dissolved in the global stew. We see that in Britain, in English and Scottish nationalism especially. English nationalism was key to Brexit. And we see it of course in France with Le Pen and in the newer members of the E.U.  including Poland and Hungary.\nBut part of the angst in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic  the Visegrad Four  is feeling pushed around by others in the European Union, especially Germany and the E.U. bureaucracy in Brussels. And that came out forcefully in their refusal to accept even a small quota of Syrian refugees.\nFrom a Reader\nIn terms of using her gender, although your analysis is very accurate, dont you think the debate destroyed these attempts of normalization and using her gender? She appeared brutal and aggressive, certainly not projecting the image of a protective mother of the nation; not knowledgeable about many subjects, and sometimes dangerously unstable and frightening?\nMaria asks a great question: Has Le Pen been hurt by sexism?\nMaria, I think the debate was not Marine Le Pens finest moment. Many analysts felt that she came off as too aggressive. And, of course, that raises the interesting question of whether a woman on the attack is perceived more harshly than a man would be. Macron called her ideas stupidities and there was a sense as you say that her knowledge seemed thin. But the analysts I spoke to in Europe did not think it destroyed her gender strategy. She has long been seen as assertive and forceful.\nWhat will be interesting is to see the gender breakdown of her vote, when that is possible to be analyzed.\nJust in: French polling agencies project that Emmanuel Macron has won the election, with potentially as much as 65.1 percent of the vote.\nThats based on early projections, not an exit poll, and its certainly nothing close to a final figure.\nOur news story has just updated:\nBut it seems clear that Macron has won, which will be a great relief to the European Union!\nOur correspondent in Paris Liz Alderman says that his supporters at the Louvre are going wild. She writes: Im hearing cheers from my window in central Paris.\nOn the BBC, I see lots of flags waving at the Louvre, where Macrons supporters are gathered.\nWere also joined by Aurelien Breeden from our Paris bureau.\nAurelien, what are you seeing?\nThese are still projections based on preliminary results, but all the polling institutes are pointing to a Macron victory, with scores projected to be anywhere between 65 and 66 percent for him, and between 33 and 34 percent for Le Pen.\nWow, this is big.\nAt 39, Macron will be the youngest French head of state since Napoleon!\nHis political movement  En Marche!  just started a year ago. And he has never held elected office before now.\nBut were also seeing signs that the abstention rate is high  the highest of any French presidential election since 1969.\nSusan and Steve, what do you make of all this?\nThe abstention rate is not altogether surprising, Sewell  the pollsters saw most of it coming. There was unhappiness with the choice from a lot of mainstream voters, not just left-wing voters. Mlenchon played coy and refused to endorse Macron. And for some, Macron seems too young, too smooth and a bit empty, but they couldnt bring themselves to vote for Le Pen, either.\nThis election has been so extraordinary in so many ways. If these projections hold up, Macron has a substantial margin. But we must remember that estimates that the turnout rate was low and that abstentions were at a historic high suggests that disaffection and anger remain an important factor in France, one that any new government will have to contend with.\nOf course now Macron has to cobble together a working majority in the legislature, which votes in two rounds in June The center-right, Les Rpublicains of Sarkozy and Fillon, hope to be able to win enough seats to force a cohabitation and a prime minister from their party. Macron will look to get a majority of his own for his new En Marche!, while promising new faces and gender equality.\nAnd even though Le Pens results appear to be lower than the initial polls suggested, it is remarkable that the National Front won a third of the vote, if those projections hold.\nFor readers just joining us: Marine Le Pen is addressing her supporters.\nShe has just conceded defeat, saying that she has congratulated Emmanuel Macron.\nShe described her patriotic and republican alliance as the main voice of opposition in France now, and noted that neither of the two major parties advanced past the first round of the election, on April 23.\nI want to thank the 11 million French people who gave me their vote, she said.\n11 million votes is not, as they say in New York, chopped liver. There are a lot of voters out there for the National Front to build upon, and Macron has a lot of responsibility on his shoulders to make a difference, and not just be another failed reformist president.\nMarine Le Pen also thanked her supporters for their courage in supporting her. She noted that the mainstream French parties were shut out of the runoff, which shows the degree of alienation and frustration.\nSo she is continuing to stroke her themes that something is very wrong in France.\nShe is now trying to position herself as part of a new political force. Here she is trying to grab victory from defeat  and looking cannily to the upcoming parliamentary elections.\nMarine Le Pen, conceding defeat, seems very calm. She has called for a new force, and thanked Nicolas Dupont-Aignan  another right-wing candidate who took part in the first round  for backing her. She seems to be rallying the right wing in advance of the legislative elections in June.\nExactly, Steve and Sewell. She is not going away and she made that clear in her concession speech.\nSusan, what did you make of Marine Le Pens demeanor? She seemed to barely mention Macron  as if his victory were a footnote.\nShe called him the candidate of continuity  given the low popularity of the current president, Franois Hollande, who decided not to seek re-election, thats not praise.\nI thought she was admirably calm and resolute. Perhaps she is rebounding from having gone too far in the debate. But she is not backing down. She was not dire or dark in her presentation.\nBut she also made clear that she is going to try to remain a force to be reckoned with as France grapples with dislocation and change.\nDowning Street, the British prime ministers office, just announced: The Prime Minister warmly congratulates President-elect Macron on his election success. France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new President on a wide range of shared priorities.\nIm struck that Macron represents a new generation in French leadership  he turns 40 this December  but, remember, he served Hollande as economy minister; he is a graduate of Frances top training ground for civil servants, the cole Nationale d'Administration; and he had the support (following the April 23 first round) of the candidates he beat from the two major parties.\nThat said, he will be the first president of the Fifth Republic not to come from either major party. And his career has been nothing short of stratospheric.\nOne of the questions Macron will face is how to project hope, particularly for a disaffected younger generation. He is Frances youngest president, but his background in finance and his economic views still do not mesh with a significant part of the French population.\nOf course, as Sewell points out, he does have grounding the French establishment, even though he has separated himself from the traditional parties.\nThe European Union is breathing a huge sigh of relief. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the E.U., just released this letter to President-elect Macron:\nI rejoice in the fact that the ideas that you have defended, of a strong and progressive Europe, which protects all of its citizens, should be those that France will carry under your tenure in the debate on Europes future.\nIndeed, you can hear the sigh of relief in many European capitals.\nThe other big challenge for Macron is to make good on his promises to shake up the complacency in Brussels, to restore France as a worthy partner in the E.U. to Germany and to help manage British exit, or Brexit.\nYes, thats a really interesting point. How will France relate to the E.U. and placate those who worry about France losing independence?\nAttention will also focus soon on the upcoming snap election in Britain, set for June 8. Theresa May has called the election an attempt to strengthen her mandate as she negotiates Britains exit from the E.U. So drama in the bloc will continue.\nJust in, a statement from President Franois Hollande. He says he has called President-elect Emmanuel Macron to congratulate him.\nHis victory confirmed that a large majority of our citizens wanted to gather around the values of the Republic and to record their attachment to the European Union and to Frances openness in the world. I expressed to him my best wishes for our country. The major challenge is to continue Frances path toward progress and social justice.\nA generous response from Frances outgoing president, Franois Hollande, who will go down as a weak leader who did much to harm the prospects of his Socialist Party, even though Mr. Hollande did very well on foreign affairs.\nFrom a Reader\nIts been suggested that a Le Pen victory might be a death knell for the E.U. Assuming Macron wins, is the bloc secure for the foreseeable future? Or are there more threats on the horizon?\nHi, Daniel. I think it is a great relief to the European Union, but the bloc faces serious strains from migration, slow growth (though improving), a failure to create institutions to manage the euro common currency and the continuing problems of Greek debt  let alone a more assertive Russia, which seems to have tried to interfere in the French election and already in the German one coming in September. There are no other countries within the E.U. that want to leave, or where there is a majority of opinion for leaving. There are strains, but so far not fatal.\nFrom a Reader\nCriticisms against banks and internationalized elites + xenophobia and nationalism + strong rhetoric about a social revolution for the people (however it is defined) = a very old formula that was also strong after the first globalisation at the beginning of the century (and which nourished fascism in Europe). Do you see the recent evolution in Europe and in the US as a new cycle of this kind? And Steven, how do you define populism. Can one say that populism is democracy without defining exactly what populism means? (see Jan-Werner Mller).\nValerie, good questions of course. Yes, I do see this as a new version of an old ideology, refitted for an enemy (global capitalism) that has also morphed. There is an anxiety about identity, about a decent future for children, about la Patrie that is general. The problem with defining populism is that its different in different places. We had William Jennings Bryan in the U.S. in the late 1800s who used the issue of currency  the gold standard  to appeal to those left behind; we had regional politicians like George Wallace and Huey Long who played on racial issues and were regarded as populists. The French had Poujade, who railed about tax in the name of shopowners and villagers. When I say populism is democracy, I mean that it represents legitimate concerns of voters, whose vote is as important as anyone elses, and the elite  try defining that!  needs to pay attention.\nFrom a Reader\nDo you think there is a chance of a possible cohabitation after the legislative elections?\nWe have a smart reader question about cohabitation. Broadly speaking, when the president and the Parliament come from the same party, France has a very strong presidency; but when the Parliament and the president come from different parties, the president is more like a figurehead  thats happened three times in Frances modern history. What happens if Macrons movement, En Marche!, fails to win a majority in Parliament next month?\nMacron will clearly have to woo support from other parties to enact his agenda. Now we will turn to see how well he can navigate the upcoming legislative elections and what kinds of alliances he will enter into. He has hinted he will turn to Christine Lagarde, head of the I.M.F., as a prime minister.\nWell get a chance to see whether Macrons relative inexperience as a politician helps or hampers his attempt to turn promises into concrete measures.\nSusan and Steve, thanks so much for sharing your insights tonight. Were now being joined by Liz Alderman, from Paris; Alison Smale, from Berlin; and Amanda Taub, from Washington.\nIt was a pleasure. Thanks so much for tuning in.\nFor readers just joining us: Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old independent candidate and former economy minister who built a political movement from scratch, has been elected president of France. Our journalists are analyzing the results live.\nYou can also follow news developments here:\nAnd you can see the results here on this nifty map, which is being updated live as the French government releases vote totals:\nEuropean leaders are breathing a big sigh of relief.\nThe spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has weighed in to congratulate Mr. Macron:\nSo has the prime minister of Spain:\nAnd the former prime minister of Italy:\nAlison, whats the mood in Berlin?\nHi, I am Alison Smale, Berlin bureau chief. There is a big sigh of relief here in Germany, with both Chancellor Angela Merkel and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel swiftly saluting the outcome as good for Europe.\nOne of the big questions will be whether Germany goes along with Macrons ideas for reforming the euro currency zone and other changes.\nMr. Gabriel, who was economy minister until recently, exuded over the outcome saying that the French decided for optimism, reform and openness to the world. The German Social Democrats will be very happy if Macron helps them swing European affairs more to the center left.\nIndeed, Mr. Gabriel, Germanys foreign minister, even said before the result was announced that a Macron victory might force Germanys formidable finance miniser Wolfgang Schuble to change his stubborn opposition to reforms of the euro zone  a 180 degree shift he said!!\nHi, Im Liz Alderman, the European business correspondent based in Paris. I cover European economic issues and have long followed the situation in France, as well as the broad fallout from the euro crisis.\nAs Susan and Steve mentioned earlier, the next big issue will be whether Macron can get a majority in the upcoming legislative elections to push through his reform promises. Voters from around the country, on TV and on French media, have been saying they were not so much voting for Macron as voting against Le Pen, so he also has a lot of convincing to do.\nAmanda, Marine Le Pen lost tonight, but she appears to have won about a third of French voters.\nShes estimated to have gotten 34.5 percent of the vote  nearly double what her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, got in 2002, and the 17.9 percent she got in the first round of the 2012 election.\nWhat do you make of her concession speech, in which she said that the National Front is now the voice of the opposition in France?\nIm Amanda Taub, a columnist based in D.C. Ive been covering the rise of populism in France and elsewhere for The Interpreter column.\nI was in France during the run-up to the first round of the election, and so have been eagerly watching to see how the trends I saw there would play out in todays round.\nI think its important not to lose sight of how big a deal it is that Le Pen won such a high percentage of the votes today. She didnt win, but she has managed to break through the taboos that once made her party a pariah. That is a massive change in French politics  and a sign that far-right populism continues to be a force to be reckoned with.\nAlison, what does this mean for the German elections this fall  the next big electoral test for Europe?\nSewell, thanks for the question on Germany. Here in Berlin, the election was very closely followed and there are hopes that France and Germany will now resort to their traditionally close partnership to introduce reforms in Europe. Chancellor Angela Merkel is also looking strong here and German center-leftists will hope for reforms of their own. So, as Ms. Merkel already said in her congratulations, a good day for Germany and for Europe.\nMartin Schulz, the leader of Germanys Social Democrats and Angela Merkels top rival in Germanys federal elections this fall, has also joined the chorus of congratulations around Mr. Macron:\nYes  Martin Schulz will hope for a lift in his own fortunes. He has said he will give a big speech outlining his plans this week, but his party also just suffered a bad result in state elections in northern Germany today. So the Macron effect in Germany may be mixed.\nAs for Germanys elections  right now, Ms. Merkel is looking set to win a fourth term. But there is still a ways to go before the Sept. 24 national elections in Germany.\nFor readers just joining us, you can find live results here:\n(Its important to note that large cities  like Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse and Nantes  have largely not yet come in yet. Macrons lead may well rise when they do.)\nAlison, Im curious what you make of Le Pens high support among young people in France. I know that in Germany support for the far right has tended to skew older, but the far-right AFD has an active youth wing, and when I spoke to some of them in January, they were very excited by youth support for the National Front and saw it as a path to success for the AFD in Germany too.\nDo you think Le Pens success in France will show that theres a youth-focused playbook that can work elsewhere?\nAmanda, thanks for your sharp question.\nThe Alternative for Germany, the populist party here, has suffered a slump in popularity since your visit in January. I would not at all write them out of the political scene, but at their recent congress there was scant sign of young activists.\nThe youth vote will be fascinating to watch in Germany  people under 25 have no real memory of politics without Angela Merkel as chancellor. That can break both ways of course. And if Marine Le Pen succeeds in pulling together a good show in French parliamentary elections next month, that will be a factor here too.\nAmanda makes an important point. Le Pens populism was a big influence in the election, and kept much of the discussion focused on the difficult state of the French economy and rising inequality in the country. She also kept the conversation focused on Europe and the idea that European institutions, including the euro, have hurt France.\nMacron has said that France can only be as strong as a part of Europe, and his win tonight certainly comforts leaders of European capitals because it means France wont pull away, and Europe wont break apart.\nI wonder if the anti-Euro message of parties like the National Front and the AFD limits their appeal among older voters who might otherwise agree with their anti-immigrant stance. (The Brexit vote, for instance, skewed older, but the UK doesnt use the Euro.) Leaving the common currency might seem much riskier to retirees than to young people.\nIs the 34.5 percent Marine Le Pen seems to have won the strongest showing for a far-right party in Western Europe?\nAs journalists, we tend to focus on the short-term outcome  Macron Won  but the trend line of National Front support seems quite real.\nAssume you mean the highest in recent decades, Sewell\nYou are right about the trend line, though. I keep coming back to the chart in this tweet from Matthew Goodwin. Its a good reminder to take the long view!\nWe should remember that Austrias presidential election last December saw the far right Freedom Party candidate there finish in the high 40 percentage, best showing ever for that party since World War II.\nTrue, but that was for a largely ceremonial position.\nIndeed. But the fight became an intense struggle between the mainstream and the fringe, as well as right and left.\nAlison, thats a good point. I think that these elections show two things: rising support for the far right, but also the decline of the taboo against voting for them.\nA lot of people  young and old  in France see the euro as having hurt their wallets since it was introduced. That said three quarters of the French dont want the country to pull out of the euro, given the likely damage that would unfurl in both France and Europe.\nTurning to Lizs point, I think the euro will be strengthened by tonights result.\nPausing this conversation for a moment, because Macron has just begun to speak.\nHe seems extremely calm, speaking in a very measured tone.\nThere were lots of problems that have made us weak for too long, he says, noting economic difficulties.\nHe said he understood the frustration of those who voted for Ms. Le Pen: I know the rage, I know the anxiety, the doubts that lots of you expressed.\nHe said he would work to guarantee not only Frances security but also its unity.\nHe said that France was the heir of a humanistic message  a reference to the nations self-identity as a beacon of democratic ideals  but also said that France needed new blood. He assured the international community that France remained a partner on issues like fighting climate change. And he vowed not to let up the struggle against terrorism  an important message in a country where around 240 lives have been claimed by terrorism since January 2015.\nMacron, making his victory speech, so far has largely stayed away from specific policies, but spoke with urgency. I will not be stopped by any difficulty or obstacle, he said. He promised to serve with total determination.\nWhat did you all think? Liz?\nHe clearly was seeking to deliver a message of inclusion, and to reach out to those who didnt vote for him, saying his primary goal was to protect people economically and in terms of national security. And he sent a strong message to Europe that France was with it. Whether he can deliver on his domestic goals, though, is still pretty uncertain.\nMacrons speech, particularly his appeal to the rage and anxiety of Le Pens voters, was a reminder of how much this election has been fought on the turf of identity and emotion, rather than policy. I think that for too long, journalists and analysts dismissed those things in favor of real issues like the economy. But now were seeing them decide elections over and over in the West. Turns out they are real, and very very powerful political forces.\nI think he sought to put a somber face to the joy he also embraced, and to promise his compatriots that he will try to include all of them on his new course. He will undoubtedly head to Berlin for his first foreign visit, and I am sure Angela Merkel will welcome him also as a possible change agent. She can borrow some of his lan. IF he proves able to form a parliamentary force and to realize those reforms.\nI share Lizs skepticism on that.\nIm struck that he did not take a victory lap. He called Ms. Le Pens showing historic. He acknowledged the rage of many of her supporters.\nTheres a big difference between winning one election and actually governing.\nAnd with the parliamentary elections still coming soon, hes still in the middle of a political marathon. In a lot of ways it would be premature to assume victory now.\nHe had to acknowledge that rage. There is a lot of it out there amid rising inequality and increased economic precariousness for many French people, which also fed into the emotion of this campaign.\nMacron promises changes that will address much of that for instance, overhauling French labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire. But there are still many voters who see that as ushering in less security.\nYet whether he can even make those changes depends on whether hell muster enough backing in the Parliament and again, thats not certain.\nWell, Sewell, he will go and bathe in his supporters joy at the Louvre. But I think it was smart to be somber at first. I remember when Nicolas Sarkozy was elected president in 2007  a crazy scene of photographers pursuing him on motorbikes before he basked in public joy.\nIn 2012, Franois Hollande came and exulted about bringing leftist change to Europe. Emmanuel Macron has put the somber stuff first.\nAnd lets not forget the historically low turnout rates and high abstentions. If theres one message the French electorate sent today, its rejection.\nMaybe rejection, or not feeling included. And then both Marine Le Pen and Macron came out to play for these people. We are at the start and not the end of a fierce political battle.\nBut in the end, Alison, wasnt Macron running as an establishment candidate? Hes an independent, to be sure  neither left nor right  but he won with the blessing of the two major parties, after he defeated them in the first round.\nSewell, of course Macron rallied establishment support, which had nowhere else to go if it wanted to preserve for example the European order. Everyone knows that if he fails as a reformer, then there may be no stopping the forces of the National Front next time. But he has made his mark in just a year, and without the mainstream parties backing him until now.\nSewell and Alison, there are two kinds of establishment here, I think. Macron was an establishment candidate in terms of his education, his connections to Hollande, and his embrace of mainstream political norms on things like immigration and multiculturalism. But he was an outsider to the actual institutions of the political establishment, which now seem very weak indeed.\nTo your point, Liz, Marine Le Pen promised an easy fix to those economic problems. She basically said reduce immigration, increase trade protections, and presto, your problems will be solved!\nMacron beat her in this election, but her message is much simpler than his insistence on complicated reforms that many find scary. It will be interesting to see how that plays out in the parliamentary elections.\nSpeaking of the economy, Liz, I wonder what the bankers and finance types in Paris and beyond think of Macrons triumph?\nBankers are of course ecstatic. He will keep the status quo but try to reform some of the French and European institutions that havent worked very well.\nBut if the French economy doesnt pick up from stagnant growth, financial markets will start reacting to that. And it wont make it any easier to negotiate with Berlin on the institutional reforms hes pushing for Europe.\nIn the end, Le Pens emotional appeals on immigration, terrorism and the economy failed to grab voters who didnt veer toward her or Macron in the first round. Her vision of pulling away from Europe and the euro scared a lot of people.\nThat said, hes got a short honeymoon period. If he doesnt come off as a strong leader, or if his economic program doesnt deliver, he will have an even harder time governing given that he might not get a parliamentary majority to begin with.\nPresident Trump has just congratulated Frances president-elect, Emmanuel Macron:\nI know were having a deep discussion about policy and all, but I want to note that Marine Le Pens (estranged) father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the far-right National Front in 1972, has just given an interview blaming her, in essence, for her defeat.\nIt is the problems of the euro, of Europe, of pensions that have dragged down the campaign of Madame Le Pen, I think, he told RTL radio. I think we must speak to France about the real problems, demographic problems, problems of mass immigration.\nWhat do we make of this? Immigration and security were certainly themes of Marine Le Pens campaign, though her flirtation with restoring the franc and with Frexit might have scared some moderate voters away.\nHes hardly a disinterested observer, given that Marine essentially kicked him out of the party after a particularly shocking round of Holocaust denialism!\nAgain the Le Pen family drama is surfacing. Susan and Steve had a great discussion of that  as of much else. I wonder if this kind of family feud does them any good politically.\nA lot of French analysts Ive spoken to have said that Marine probably wishes she had a different last name. And indeed it was striking that the words Le Pen were hardly seen on her campaign posters or literature.\nYes, that absence of Le Pen was striking, Amanda. She may also not be happy about her father giving such heavy backing to Marion, Marines niece, as the better presidential candidate in the future. Really, though, I do wonder if family politics can win support in the modern age.\nWe heard Le Pen in her concession speech promise to transform the National Front to make it a new political movement by calling on patriots to join her.\nAmanda, how do you think the party will remake itself to capitalize on Macrons presidency and try to be stronger when the next presidential election rolls around?\nOne thing they are already trying to do is to create some new stars within the party who dont have the last name Le Pen. Marine Le Pen has put a spotlight on David Rachline, the popular young National Front senator and mayor of the southern city of Frjus, for instance.\nIt will be fascinating to watch the National Front deal with this, and whether it evolves. Certainly, mainstream politics (like mainstream media) are in a state of flux. Macron has an amazing opportunity  though, as Liz so clearly says, probably one that has a short life.\nIts a tricky dance. They are trying to reach out to new, younger voters, and to de-demonize the party so that voting for it isnt stigmatized. But they cannot afford to alienate the old base.\nAlison, does that exclude a role for her niece Marion Marchal Le Pen, who hews closer to Le Pen pres views?\nNo, I think Jean-Marie Le Pen is pushing Marion. I just wonder if voters like one family dispensing power in this way.\nLiz, I dont know if it excludes Marion, but I think that she and Marine could be heading for a clash. Weve seen this play out in other far-right parties as well, who have struggled to balance their mission to become mainstream candidates with their embrace of harsh, often xenophobic views that repel mainstream voters.\nOn Macron, I was struck by Ipsoss polling results: 43 percent of Macron voters said they chose him to vote against Le Pen, and 33 percent because they wanted a new kind of politics. Only 16 percent chose him for his policies. Thats not much of a positive mandate.\nThats definitely not a positive mandate! He has certainly energized young voters, especially people with an entrepreneurial spirit. There are a lot of young people who agree with him that France needs to change, to have a more flexible working regime to get unemployment down  that was a huge issue in the campaign.\nOn the other hand, many also see him as moving forward with the status quo and introducing more of an American-style economic regime, which to them represents job insecurity.\nIn general, an interesting night for the fate of the European far right. Meanwhile I am watching the shots from the Louvre and the bands playing and wondering how anyone straddles the social and cultural currents of modern Europe and mixes them with the traditional impulses.\nIf Macron can harness the energy, perhaps he can overcome the abstentions and apathy we also see in todays vote. He will need to know what he wants  Frances recent presidents have not succeeded in keeping promises. Perhaps Macron will avoid that trap.\nLets also not forget voters on the far left who  like many on the far right  felt alienated and disaffected. Many of them supported the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mlenchon, who came in fourth in the first round of the election. And many of them abstained today, under slogans like  no joke  neither plague nor cholera. On Twitter, Mr. Mlenchon just wrote: People, unite, dont let go. The country is not condemned to either the rich or the hateful.\nSewell, thats a really striking comparison to 2002, the last time a National Front candidate made it to the second round of a French election. The center-right Jacques Chirac beat Marine Le Pens father in a landslide, with 82 percent of the vote, even though Chirac was facing criminal charges for corruption at the time. That round, people used the slogan vote for the crook, not the fascist  quite a difference from Mlenchons supporters neither plague nor cholera attitude today.\nI think that shows how much more acceptable it has become to vote for the far right. People no longer feel a duty to oppose the National Front at all costs. And it also speaks to the weakness of the parties today. This time none of the mainstream candidates made it past the first round.\nAmanda, it also speaks to the appeal Le Pen had to voters who worry about immigration, another huge issue in this debate. Even some who didnt vote Le Pen cited this as a major concern. Le Pen talked about dramatically reducing immigration to France and conflated immigration with terrorism. Macron is taking the opposite tack and calling for better integration.\nFor readers just joining us: our all-star panel of New York Times journalists is discussing the victory of President-elect Emmanuel Macron.\nHes a 39-year-old political novice, who had never before run for elected office. He was economy minister under the current president, Franois Hollande, before he left government and started an independent political movement, En Marche! The son of doctors, and one of three children, he grew up in Amiens, France, and has had one of the fastest political ascents in France of anyone since  Napoleon.\nLiz, Amanda and Alison: I want to turn to some reader questions now, for the remainder of our chat.\nFrom a Reader\nThere has been a great deal of commentary on the ripple effects of Brexit/Trump, in terms of nationalist rhetoric gaining mainstream political approval across the world. A lot has been said particularly about what this portends for the future of the European Union, in light of major elections in the Netherlands, France & Germany this year. Geert Wilders couldnt pull it off. Le Pen has failed. Macron doesnt exactly embody the mainstream establishment, but his strong commitment to the EU surely means his victory is bad news for euroskeptic parties across Europe. Angela Merkel is most certainly pleased about President Macron, but how much will his victory help her when Germany votes in September?\nHi, Nikhil. Thats a great question!\nI think that its a big mistake to look just at who won or lost a particular election, rather than the overall trends. And the overall trend is that populist parties are on the rise across the West. In most places they arent winning outright, but theyre now popular enough to make them a political force that cant be ignored. And if the trends continue, a win, or at least a spot in a governing coalition, is in their futures.\nAnd its worth noting that many of the differences come down to the particulars of the political systems, not just the popularity of the candidates. In the United States, for instance, Donald Trump was able to win the nomination even though he didnt have a majority of primary voters, and actually only got around 30 percent of the votes in most competitive contests. But that was enough to get the G.O.P. nomination, and then this countrys strong polarization powered him through the rest of the way to the White House.\nFrom a Reader\nBonsoir, comment percevez-vous cette lection (en tant qu'Amricains, et en tant que journalistes) ? Nous avons vu les critiques envers les mdias se multiplier de la part du Front national comme aux Etats-Unis de la part de Donald Trump. Pensez-vous que la France soit gagne par cette vague de violence envers les mdias, que je trouve si typique des mouvements populistes ou autoritaires (nous dirions bonapartistes en France) qui refusent tous les intermdiaires entre le peuple et les dirigeants lus ? Et empchent de fait un dbat intelligent et clair au profit de la propagande politique ? Merci.\n(For non-francophone readers: Nathalie is asking how we perceive the election as Americans and as journalists (note: Alison is British!) and whether France has succumbed to the tendency to blame the media, which is typical of populist movements that dont want intermediaries between them and the people.)\nNathalie  bonne question! C'est toujours difficile quand les journalistes ne peuvent pas travailler avec la libert qui est necessaire. But it is not just journalists who need to be active in this case  the whole society is needed when there are moments of truth and change such as we now see in Europe. And the whole society is also needed to preserve the standing of the media. J'espre que a adresse votre question!\nNathalies question reflects concerns felt all over Europe in the past year. I think we will all be taking a close look at how mainstream media and social media function  in politics, in life  as the technology opens up ever more vistas, and hopefully opens closed minds, too.\nNathalie, when I was at a Le Pen rally in March, her supporters delighted in telling me that I was part of the Merde-ia, a play on the English word for media, and the French word merde, which means  not sure Im allowed to say it here?\nFrom a Reader\nLooking at the map it seems Le Pen had noticeably stronger support in the northeast of France than elsewhere. It would be interesting to understand this geographical divide.\nPhilip, the geographic divide reflects what we saw in the first round of voting too. Many of these areas, including the so-called Rust Belt of France, have been economically devitalized and subject to de-industrialization and major job losses.\nIt was there that Le Pens argument that globalization  and immigration  hurts people resonated the most. Many are the angry voters whom Macron tonight promised to take care of, and they are highly skeptical that his more free-market approach will do that.\nFrom a Reader\nIl n'y a jamais eu autant de vote blanc (12% des suffrages exprims) et l'abstention est trs haute (25%). Macron ne part il pas dj avec un grand dsavantage ?\nClment is asking about the roughly 25 percent of voters who abstained, and about those voters who went to the polls but cast a blank (protest) ballot. Hes asking whether Macron will start his presidency at a big disadvantage.\nClment, it certainly is a disadvantage for Macron that a historic number of voters voted blanc and a higher number of people abstained. Its highly symbolic and shows that a lot of people are fed up and have enough concern about the future that they wanted to show their opposition to both candidates.\nFrom a Reader\nWeve seen in the US presidential election, the Brexit vote and now the French presidential election attempts by assorted players to game the system with hacks, fake news, and massive, state-supported online trolling operations. Is this the new normal for western democratic processes?\nFor more on abstentions and protest votes, check out this article:\nDavid, yes we have seen developments that combine harassment of old with technologies that are new. Generally speaking, if people spot a way to try to get the outcome they seek, they will explore and use it. So the new normal may well include all these things.\nI have been in this business a long time and remember very well how the Soviets funded a Western peace movement in the 1970s and 1980s to try to block deployment of NATO missiles in response to Soviet ones. Politics has always been a contest; the means change. Seen like that, the new normal is also the old normal. Vigilance is what we need!\nFrom a Reader\nThe French election, like the American before it, reflects divisions on the left and right that can can obscure underlying similarities in their critiques of savage capitalism. Elites have often found that they can divide and defeat genuine popular movements for greater justice, freedom and equality by playing on cultural prejudices. Is there any evidence of new social movements capable of bridging these cultural chasms to unite around the larger values they actually still share  a commitment to fairness in economics and law, a renewed commitment to community and the common good, a healthy, non-exclusionary affection for people and place?\nHi, Mark. I think you are right that there are still a lot of shared values and beliefs that people could agree upon. But I think the lesson of these recent elections in France, the UK, the US, and elsewhere, is that those things just arent the most salient to peoples political decisions right now.\nInstead, people are voting based on identity  mostly national identity, racial identity, and religious identity  often out of a sense that they are losing status and looking for a way to regain it.\nBut I dont think we can dismiss that as mere prejudice. I read a lot of political psychology literature, and there is a huge body of work that basically comes down to if people feel like they are losing status, they will turn to group identity as a way to regain it.\nRight now were in a period of massive economic and demographic change, and a lot of people do feel like they are losing status and stability they once thought they could count on. So in a lot of ways were seeing exactly the strengthening of identity politics we would expect to see. And we probably shouldnt expect it to go away soon, either.\nFor folks just joining us: our journalists are taking reader questions as we await remarks by Emmanuel Macron to his supporters gathered at the Louvre. His Twitter account has been on fire over the last hour. Heres one tweet that stands out:\nIn it, Macron says, I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that many of you have expressed. Its a clear effort to reach out to the one-third of voters who chose his opponent, Marine Le Pen. She lost, but more people have rallied to the message of her far-right party, the National Front, than in any national election since her father founded it in 1972.\nFrom a Reader\nIs there at least some budding awareness that Le Pen was either aligned or supported by the anti democratic forces exemplified by Putin? Further, what is the current take on Putins operatives attempting to sway voters towards weakening NATO?\nBill  good questions from Canada! We know that Marine Le Pen went to see Putin in the Kremlin a few weeks before the first round, that the Russians enabled her party to get a 10 million euro credit and that the Kremlin has made little secret (for decades, by the way) of relishing unrest and disunity in Europe. Clearly it pays to keep ones eyes open.\nBut perspective also tells us that these attempts have not succeeded in the past. In general, too, it is eastern Europe that is more susceptible to Russian pressure, because of geographic proximity, and the general poverty of the East. A suivre, as they say in France.\nFrom a Reader\nYou mention the economic situation of low growth and high (relative to the US) unemployment. My question is, does the social safety net in France mean that unemployment is less important? Are people starving or homeless because of the French economic situation? Or is this part of the growing need for most industrial economies to deal with higher unemployment as things like automation make fewer workers more productive? Does France NEED more jobs? Or just not know what to do to face a new kind of work in the 21st century?\nCliff, the French economy has been tepid to stagnant since the financial crisis hit Europe in 2008. As other countries have recovered, France has lagged behind, partly because of de-industrialization and automation, and partly because the rigid labor laws make employers reluctant to hire. Unemployment has been stuck around 10 percent since 2012 and the vast majority of new contracts being offered are temporary or precarious.\nThe social safety net does help  it means if you lose your job, you will get support that is more generous than in the United States, and you still have health care. But the cost of funding it is high taxes on employers and workers.\nMacron has pledged to try and make the system more flexible and to encourage more entrepreneurship, but how much that leads to better jobs remains to be seen.\nAlso in response to Cliffs question: When I spoke to Le Pen supporters, unemployment came up constantly as a reason they had abandoned the mainstream parties. But it was striking that nearly all of the people I spoke to had jobs or were retired. To them, unemployment seemed as much of a symbol of what they saw as Frances broken system as it was an immediate financial concern.\nAbout employment or lack of it: Just as regions that have few immigrants tend to be the most anti-immigrant, I think there is a fear of joblessness as much as there is also a great lack of jobs, especially for the young. The lag in France and the frequent short-term job contracts there exacerbate these fears.\nWow, a quick break from readers questions: journalists who are following Marine Le Pen have been posting videos of her dancing with supporters.\nShes dancing to the music of the French singer-songwriter Jean-Jacques Goldman. Gotta give her credit for handling defeat with a smile!\nFrom a Reader\nThe strongest region for Le Pen was Aisne, which has historically tilted to the left. To what extent is Le Pen representing a burn it all down mentality for some voters dissatisfied with the status quo (and not just the fascism)?\nHi, Will.\nIts worth noting that Le Pens platform was not so far from traditional leftism in some respects: She promised a stronger welfare state, for instance, and spoke a great deal about protecting French workers.\nBut the key difference was that she took a much narrower, ethnically and religiously exclusive tone on who was a true French worker to be protected. And I think that appealed to a lot of people who are feeling insecure about their future  as I alluded to a few minutes ago, theres a lot of research showing that people become more attached to their ethnic identities when they lose other kinds of status and opportunity.\nFrom a Reader\nAre people in France ready for the fact that if Macron needs to implement his agenda of public sector job cuts and making it easier to fire employees, then they are going to have to face up to a strong pushback from unions? Earlier French presidents have had to back down in the face of such protests as it seems the public is sympathetic to unions.\nAnirudh, thats a key question. Union membership in France has been sliding; today only around 7 percent to 8 percent of workers belong to one, but unions continue to wield considerable power.\nMacron says hes going to push back, by decree if necessary, by allowing company-level agreements on questions that are now decided by industry-wide negotiations, which unions say will undermine them. We saw angry demonstrations all over France recently when modest labor law changes were made. They may get fiercer under Macron.\nFrom a Reader\nWho will be PM?!\nDebbie asks a great question. A lot of observers wonder if Macron will turn to Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She would be the second female prime minister of France, following dith Cresson.\nI wonder whether Lagarde could be tempted to take that post  she had no background in French politics until tapped by Sarkozy to run finance. Not sure, despite her strong reputation and standing internationally, that she adds what Macron needs in terms of French base support.\nMacron enigmatically said he already knew who his prime minister would be. But that still presumably depends on the outcome of the legislative elections! Few people have actually been talking about Christine Lagarde, although she and Macron are friends. Given how much she represents high finance, though, Im betting people whose Macron vote was really a vote against Le Pen would be less than welcoming of that alliance.\nFrom a Reader\nCan Macron count on the Republicans, who will presumably be the party most aligned with his economic policies, to pass his proposed plans for France? Also, will Macron be out on the campaign trail rallying supporters of both the PS and the Republicans in order to form an En Marche coalition? And who will he appoint as his prime minister? Any prime minister heavily aligned with one party would surely alienate potential allies, no?\nI will defer to people living in France to answer Joohwan in detail, but would note that his promise of inclusion in his speech is a strong indication he will reach out for support wherever he can find it. All French politicians are entering terra incognita as they head toward the June elections for Parliament. There is no precedent for this situation.\nFrom a Reader\nThis is not a question, and I dont expect you to post it or anything. I just wanted to say Thank you! for taking the time to answer all these questions. Your time is much appreciated. :-)\nBill, thank you!\nThanks, Bill!\nFrom a Reader\nAmanda Taub - You mention that you read political psychology literature. Any recommendations for books or articles?\nHi Shanna,\nI could easily overload this chat with a super long reading list! But this paper is a good overview article of outgrouping behavior.\nFor work that applies more directly to populism and politics today, I recommend checking out the research of Elisabeth Ivarsflaten, Pippa Norris and Ron Inglehart, Matthew Goodwin, and Eric Kauffman.\nLilliana Mason is doing some really fascinating research on how identity and polarization are affecting the political system here in the United States. And Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weilers book Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics is also a favorite of mine.\nFrom a Reader\nDo you believe that if the En Marche! campaign is unable to obtain a majority in the legislative elections that they should form a coalition with left or the right?\nGuillaume, he may not get a majorityhe doesnt have a party yet and has to start from scratch. He says hes neither left nor right, and whether he forms a coalition depends on the outcome of the legislative elections.\nEmmanuel Macron is about to address a crowd of supporters gathered at the Louvre. (Earlier, he offered brief remarks at his campaign headquarters.)\nMacron is walking out to address a huge crowd of supporters at the Louvre. Ode to Joy is playing  the European anthem.\nAn extraordinary walk to a European theme.what an interesting way to start his presidency.\nA huge cry went up at the Louvre, as Emmanuel Macron, Frances 39-year-old president-elect, ascended the stage.\nTonight, youve won  France won, Mr. Macron declared. He thanked the members of his political movement, En Marche! (On the Way!) and vowed to honor their trust and represent their lan  he repeated the word  during his five-year term.\nHe singled out voters who supported him only to prevent his far-right rival Marine Le Pen  and extremism  from taking power. I will protect the Republic, he vowed.\nHe sounded a gracious note toward Ms. Le Pens voters: They did express today their rage, their sense of loss  and their convictions, in some cases  and I do respect that. And I will do my utmost in the five years to come to make sure they dont have reason to vote for an extremist position, ever again. Thats a noble sentiment, and a big promise.\nInterestingly, hes vowing that his presidency will show those who supported Le Pen that there is no reason they should continue voting for the extremes.\nHe is speaking in front of I. M. Peis glass pyramid, in the courtyard of the Louvre, and invoking moments in French history like the Revolution (1789) and the Liberation (1944). He said that the world is looking to France to defend the values of the Enlightenment, to protect people who are oppressed, and to bring forth a new hope, a new humanism, a world of growth, justice and respect for the planet.\n(This is kind of reminding me of a certain young politicians victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago in November 2008. Anyone else think so?)\nYouve chosen audacity, he said  an echo of Obamas audacity of hope slogan.\nHe also promises to reinforce the economy while building new forms of social protection  promises that some analysts say are not fully reconcilable.\nOnce again, France is a country of surprise, he said. Certainly, this has been a campaign full of surprises:\nThe task will require that we are truthful, he said. We need to have the courage of truth.\nAnd now Macron is talking about the huge expectations for France as the country faces an enormous task. The army, police, politicians, trade unions, businessmen, bosses, students, pensioners all must take part. I cannot recall such an inclusive list from Sarkozy or Hollande.\nI think that lot of people, around the world as well as in France, will be thankful to hear those promises. But he is promising to solve some very big unsolved problems. He has a very, very challenging road ahead.\nAmanda, thats right. Hes making an inspiring speech emphasizing inclusion and renewal for France, and cohesion for Europe. And that will indeed be challenging to meet.\nHe called for a real majority, a sign that he is now shifting to campaign mode, because Macron has no parliamentary base. He will need to construct one  fast  before the two-round elections next month for the 577-member National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament.\nThe task is going to be arduous, but every time, every time, I will tell you the truth, he said, vowing to fight on Frances behalf against inefficiency, against lies, to improve the lives of all of us. So far, though, no specific hard truths.\nMacron also vowed to serve with modesty and humility, moments before citing Frances core values of libert, egalit, fraternit  a point at which the crowd roared. He closed with the standard cry: Vive la France!\nMacron is joined by his wife, Brigitte, the new first lady of France.\nShe is, as we all know by now, his former high-school teacher. Hes 39; shes 64. Their three children (hers from a previous marriage) have joined them on the stage.\nAnd now the requisite singing of La Marseillaise.\nOne wonderful thing is the concentration of young people on the stage and off. Macron will need their lan and energy. It is a welcome change from the fustiness of many European politicians.\nThe tricolor is waving in the courtyard of the Louvre as Emmanuel Macron, 39, celebrates his election as president of France. As Alison notes, a young and multicultural group is on the stage  a picture of youth and vitality. Mr. Macron will be the first president of the Fifth Republic (starting in 1958) to come from neither major political party.\nBut while he defeated the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, a third of voters chose her. Its a big night for Macron, but also a big night for Ms. Le Pens National Front, which has done better than it ever has before in a national election.\nLiz and Alison, thoughts on the victory speech?\nSewell, it was clever, inclusive, tried to reach out to all and made a promise that will be the key test  can he change France so that Le Pen supporters are turned around? Much now depends on the first task of forming a government that can enact his wishes.\nWhats striking is the tone of inclusiveness and promise, compared with the theme of fear and division that Le Pen often invoked. Its no wonder many are breathing a sigh of relief, but lets not forget that a historic number of voters abstained, and he will struggle to get a majority in Parliament. He now immediately has to show how well he can govern and follow through on his promises.\nBut clearly we have a youthful, energetic president-elect whose pledges of renewal are giving his supporters hope.\nOne final thought: Macron and Merkel could be an interesting combination of age, nationality and gender to bring something fresh to Europe. Berlin is the physically modern and powerful capital, Paris is of course la plus belle, and with infinite style.\nIf the French and Germans rediscover their sense of admiration for each other, we could see some interesting and dynamic developments. That has been missing in the years of weak leadership of France. Merkel, too, needs something new for a fourth term.\nRich food for thought.\nOn that note, Id like to thank Alison, Liz, Amanda and our other colleagues who joined us to share their insights. And thank you, readers, for your great questions and your interest in our coverage.\nThanks Alison, Liz, and Sewell. It has been great chatting with you.\nThanks to all participants!\nA reminder: We will continue to follow news developments here:\n And readers who want an in-depth look at the vote outcomes can follow along on this map:\nMore on NYTimes.com\nAdvertisement",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that personal information about hundreds of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, was leaked via an anonymous Twitter account. Notably, it specifies that none of the affected lawmakers belonged to the Alternative for Germany party.  The provided image, however, presents a screenshot of a webpage displaying biographical information about Angela Merkel, focusing on her name and affiliation with the CDU/CSU party. There is no visual evidence within the image that directly supports the claim of a data leak or the exclusion of Alternative for Germany politicians.\n\nInternal validation reveals a partial match. The image corroborates the caption's mention of Angela Merkel and her party affiliation. However, it lacks any visual elements related to the data leak itself or the exclusion of Alternative for Germany representatives.  The internal check therefore flags a discrepancy, resulting in a lower confidence score.\n\nExternal validation attempts failed to find any supporting evidence. The external check indicates that the provided information lacks any details about the described data leak involving German politicians. This discrepancy underscores the lack of evidentiary support for the caption's core claim regarding the data breach and the specific absence of Alternative for Germany members. The external validation significantly reduces the confidence in the caption's accuracy.\n\nThe discrepancy between the internal and external checks is significant. The image only shows information about Angela Merkel, while the caption details a broader data leak involving numerous German politicians and the explicit exclusion of a particular party. This difference indicates a significant gap between the visual evidence and the narrative of the news caption. There is no visual evidence suggesting a data leak, nor is there any mention of the Alternative for Germany party within the image.\n\nConsequently, due to the lack of external evidence supporting the caption's central claim and the limited corroboration from the internal visual analysis, the caption is deemed out of context. The confidence score is adjusted to reflect the low level of support for the news caption from both internal and external sources.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption by confirming Angela Merkel's identity and party affiliation. However, external validation finds no evidence supporting the claim of a data leak involving German politicians.  The lack of visual evidence in the image related to the data leak or the mentioned political party contributes to a low confidence score and an out-of-context conclusion."

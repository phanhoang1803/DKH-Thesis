He was never a CCM insider and confounded many when he was elected as the ruling party's presidential candidate.\nAs works minister in the outgoing government, Mr Magufuli was reputed to be a no-nonsense, results-driven politician. He became known as \"The Bulldozer\" for driving a programme to build roads across the country.\nHe campaigned for the presidency on a platform of hard work, and will now have to tackle far bigger problems facing the East African state. This includes constant power outages, and corruption - an issue which led to many people turning against CCM in the election.\n'The Bulldozer' in profile\nPresident Jakaya Kikwete, who is standing down after two terms in office, retweeted a CCM photo of Mr Magufuli, external and the accompanying words: \"Our next Commander-in-Chief, Dr John Pombe Magufuli, the President-elect of The United Republic of Tanzania.\"\nAbdallah Safari, vice-president of Chadema, one of the four opposition parties that make up Ukama, told the BBC that Tanzanians \"have been robbed of their victory\".\nBBC Tanzania analyst Zuhura Yunus says the result is a big blow for Mr Lowassa after four opposition parties put their faith in him, uniting for the first time to field a single candidate.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both indicate a significant mismatch between the image and the original caption. The internal check points out the lack of visual evidence supporting the claim about the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party and the Zanzibari election. The clothing of the person in the image suggests a possible cultural or political affiliation, but without further details, it is impossible to definitively link it to the CCM party.  The external check further strengthens this conclusion by highlighting that the provided caption references a different event—the Tanzanian presidential election—rather than the Zanzibari election mentioned in the original caption. There's no corroborating evidence to link the image to a celebration following a disputed Zanzibari presidential election and the CCM party.  Both checks independently conclude that the caption is likely out of context. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty inherent in interpreting the visual elements and the lack of unambiguous evidence to support the claims made in the caption. While the image depicts a celebration of some kind, the details are insufficient to definitively verify the original caption's assertion.  In the absence of strong visual evidence and contradictory external information, it's more prudent to conclude that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes reveal a significant discrepancy between the image content and the original caption.  Neither visual analysis nor external fact-checking supports the specific claims made in the original caption regarding the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party's celebration of victory in a disputed Zanzibari election."

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows visitors taking photos in a structure decorated with numerous red lanterns, a strong visual cue consistent with Chinese New Year celebrations in Singapore.  The internal check notes that while \"Dahlia Dreams\" isn't explicitly seen, the festive atmosphere and the context of the image strongly suggest a floral display.  The external check reinforces this by pointing out the plausibility of \"Dahlia Dreams\" as a name for a floral display, and the common practice of having such displays coincide with Chinese New Year celebrations in Singapore and other parts of Asia.  Both checks acknowledge the lack of direct, explicit confirmation of the \"Dahlia Dreams\" name, but given the strong visual evidence aligning with the overall description, the caption is considered accurate. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external validation results. The confidence score reflects the strong visual evidence and the plausibility of the caption's details, even without explicit confirmation of the display's specific name.  The absence of any visual tampering or miscontextualization further strengthens the conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation support the accuracy of the caption.  While the specific name \"Dahlia Dreams\" isn't directly visible, the visual evidence strongly supports the description of visitors taking photos at a floral display during Chinese New Year in Singapore."

        "content": "Hillary Clinton has endured an 11-hour hearing before a Congress committee over the deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.\nThe former secretary of state said she took responsibility and introduced reforms after the attack that killed four Americans, including the US envoy.\nShe deflected criticism that she did not do enough to protect the mission.\nHer Democratic party says the Republican-led panel is a witch-hunt trying to harm her presidential bid.\nDespite the committee sitting in four consecutive hours-long sessions on Thursday, the hearing yielded little new information.\nMrs Clinton remained composed during the highly-anticipated testimony, amid several heated exchanges between Republicans and her Democrat allies.\nIn her opening statement, she said she had asked Chris Stevens, one of the four killed, to go to Libya as US envoy.\n\"After the attacks I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket,\" she said.\n\"I took responsibility, and as part of that before I left office I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.\"\nFive key questions on the latest Benghazi hearing\nMrs Clinton said her appearance was her way of honouring the lives lost, and she called on those present to put national security above partisan politics.\nDemocratic Representative Elijah Cummings, seated next to the chairman, said Republicans were wasting taxpayer money in an effort to derail Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign.\nMrs Clinton is defending her record before, during and after the Benghazi attacks largely as she has before - taking responsibility for the mistakes, talking about lessons learned, and owning her policy positions.\nThe new element is her email record, which she has downplayed. She told lawmakers that most of her work on Libya and Benghazi wasn't done by email, mentioning an occasion when an intelligence report had to be carried to her by briefcase and read on the spot.\nThe tone has been largely measured, and the testiest exchange didn't actually involve Mrs Clinton.\nCommittee chairman Trey Gowdy has latched onto the role of a Clinton friend, Sidney Blumenthal, who sent her numerous intelligence reports on Libya by email.\nHe's suggesting Mr Blumenthal unduly influenced her Libya policy and had greater access to her than her Benghazi ambassador, Chris Stevens, who was killed.\nDemocratic committee members erupted in denial and demanded Mr Blumenthal's testimony transcripts be released, while Mrs Clinton looked on detached and bemused\nThere have already been seven congressional investigations into the attack, by suspected Islamist militants, on the US compound in the Libyan city of Benghazi on 11 September 2012.\nThe raid led to the deaths of ambassador Chris Stevens and three other US embassy staff.\nMrs Clinton said Mr Stevens was well aware of the risks of his job but withdrawing American presence from Libya would have been a mistake, she said.\n\"To retreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our ability to lead.\"\nWhen the US pulls out of places, extremists gain a foothold, she added, although she did admit that security requests made by the Benghazi consulate were not met.\nAn independent review board found deficiencies within the State Department that the Obama administration has tried to fix, said the former first lady.\nWhat are the possible consequences for Clinton?\nThe committee does not have the power to punish but depending on the conclusions there could be political consequences for Hillary Clinton, which might affect her presidential campaign\nWhat did Clinton know about security requests?\nShe has said in previous testimony that requests for additional security didn't reach her level. But she has taken responsibility for the failure. And the State Department review laid out steps to improve security at diplomatic missions.\nWhat did the other Congressional committees find?\nThis is the eighth congressional investigation. Previous committees criticised Mrs Clinton and the Obama administration on a number of points, especially the poor security at the Benghazi mission. And the intelligence was flawed.\nWhat is there left to discover?\nThe committee has suggested there will be new evidence of how poorly the state department responded to security requests for the Benghazi mission, and new evidence on how the military responded to the attack.\nRead Barbara Plett Usher's answers in full",

There is no mention of Hillary Clinton's death or any incident related to a documentary filming in Missouri.",

    "explanation": "The internal check incorrectly validates the caption due to a mismatch between the image content and the caption's claim. The image shows Hillary Clinton speaking, seemingly at a public event. The caption, however, asserts she was killed while filming a documentary in Missouri. This is a significant factual discrepancy. The external check correctly identifies this discrepancy and provides evidence that the caption's claim is false. There is no credible evidence supporting the claim that Hillary Clinton was killed while filming a documentary in Missouri.  The internal check's high confidence score is unwarranted and is primarily based on the superficial presence of Hillary Clinton's image, not a proper evaluation of the truthfulness of the caption's claim.  The high confidence score for internal validation is an error that should be corrected by designing a system that compares the caption's statement to the image more carefully.  The image is clearly of Hillary Clinton; however, there is no visual evidence that supports the caption's claim about her death or involvement in a Missouri documentary.  The external check, which finds no verifiable sources confirming the caption, is crucial here. The discrepancy between the internal and external check results emphasizes the importance of a multi-faceted validation process that incorporates both visual analysis and external fact-checking.  In this case, the external evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the caption's false assertion. Therefore, the caption is definitively out-of-context and the low confidence score reflects the substantial evidence against the caption's validity.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation erroneously confirms the caption due to a flawed analysis. External validation strongly refutes the caption, revealing it as false and out of context. The significant disagreement highlights the need for a more robust validation process that weighs external evidence heavily."

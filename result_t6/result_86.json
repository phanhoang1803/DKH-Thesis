    "explanation": "The internal validation strongly supports the caption's claim, with a high confidence score of 10. The image clearly shows a double rainbow arched over the Clyde Arc (Squinty Bridge) in Glasgow.  The internal check meticulously examines the image and its context, confirming the accuracy of the caption's description. However, the external validation produces a conflicting result.  With a low confidence score of 3, it finds no corroborating evidence to support the claim in the provided external source. This source mentions various photos from Scotland but lacks specific details to confirm or deny the existence of this particular double rainbow image over Glasgow's Squinty Bridge.  The discrepancy arises from the limited information available in the external source, not from any visual inconsistencies in the image itself.  The image is internally consistent and visually depicts a double rainbow over the bridge, accurately referencing the location as Glasgow. The lack of confirming external evidence weakens the overall confidence level despite the strong internal validation.  The primary issue is the absence of specific details in the external source to directly confirm or refute the claim. Therefore, we must rely on the internal validation, but acknowledge the significant limitation of the external validation. Without more external sources, a definitive conclusion is difficult to reach. This leads to a lower overall confidence score and the classification of \"out of context\" because while the image itself is genuine, the external check could not confirm the claim within its limited scope.  Further investigation with additional external resources that might contain records of weather events in Glasgow at that time, or other photographic evidence from similar locations and times would be necessary to definitively assess the caption's accuracy.   It is possible that the photo is genuine but that the external source simply lacked information to support it. The image's internal validity is strong, yet the lack of sufficient external support makes a definitive conclusion challenging, resulting in a conservative confidence score of 4 and an OOC designation of true due to the limitations of the external verification process.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (confidence score: 10), while external validation lacks sufficient evidence (confidence score: 3), creating a conflict and resulting in a low overall confidence and OOC classification."

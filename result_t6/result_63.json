        "content": "At least six people were killed and 16 more wounded Wednesday in an accident that happened as a passenger train was crossing a long bridge between two islands in central Denmark. Citing police, Danish media say the train was hit by something that fell off a passing freight train.\nThe accident happened around 7:30 a.m. on the busy Storebaelt bridge and tunnel system that connects the central islands of Zealand and Funen, according to the Danish Broadcasting Corp.\nFunen police say all of the 16 people who were injured are expected to recover, the Danish broadcaster reports. The trains passed each other at a site near Nyborg, roughly 75 miles west of Copenhagen.\n\"Ordinary Danes on their way to work or heading home from the Christmas holidays have had their lives smashed,\" Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said in a statement of sympathy as translated by The Associated Press.\nPolice say they're still trying to learn more details about what happened. Danish media report that an object from the freight train may have forced the passenger train to stop suddenly. The item that fell from the freight train has variously been reported as a piece of cargo or a tarpaulin.\nImages from the scene showed heavy damage to the passenger train, including a partially caved-in nose. Windows were shattered, and debris littered the tracks. The freight train, which was carrying a load that included crates of Carlsberg beer, was also damaged. Photos showed that several long tarpaulins covering the train's cargo trailers had been ripped apart.\nEmergency crews at the scene have been hampered by high winds, and even after the adjacent roadway was reopened, a high-wind advisory kept high-profile vehicles off the bridge. Police also asked drivers to move through the area of the crash at a steady pace  and not slow down to stare or take photos of the accident scene.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The image clearly depicts a train accident on a bridge, with rescue workers present. The internal check confirms that the caption accurately reflects the visual content, identifying the location as the Great Belt Bridge in Nyborg, Denmark.  The external check corroborates this information by citing a news source that explicitly mentions a train accident on the Storebaelt bridge near Nyborg, Denmark, and the presence of rescue workers hampered by high winds. There are no discrepancies or uncertainties between the internal and external checks. The confidence scores from both checks are high (10/10). The visual evidence aligns perfectly with the textual information. There's no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization.  The internal and external checks independently and consistently confirm the details presented in the caption. Given the strong agreement and high confidence scores, the caption is deemed highly accurate and not out of context.",

        "content": "In October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\nBorder agents \"say youve got to pay attention to this  $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register.\nIs this number correct? Its more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\nWell start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\nAs a result, in this fact-check, well interpret McKinleys comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinleys office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\nHeres the most recent data on drug seizures  cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl  from Customs and Border Protection.\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriffs office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\nThats less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but its in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. Its unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\"\nOur ruling\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. Thats smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.",

    "explanation": "Internal validation suggests a high confidence that the image depicts President Trump at the Southern border, aligning with the caption's core claim. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy. The external source focuses on a visit by Representative David McKinley to the border near McAllen, Texas, in October, which contradicts the caption's statement about President Trump's visit. This conflict creates uncertainty.  The visual evidence strongly supports the presence of President Trump in the image.  The uniforms, setting (what seems to be a border area with confiscated drugs), and the overall scene all point towards a border-related event with President Trump's presence. However, the external source's information directly contradicts this interpretation. To resolve this, we must acknowledge that external sources often offer more reliable information than assumptions drawn solely from visual evidence. The discrepancy points to the possibility of image miscontextualization or miscaptioning, or a conflation of two separate events. Given the significant conflict and the lack of corroborating evidence from external sources supporting President Trump's visit as described in the caption, the final judgment leans towards the caption being out of context.  It is important to rely on reliable external sources to verify claims about individuals such as public figures in specific events, especially when the information is not clearly visible in the picture or has no additional details. There is no evidence of image tampering within the image itself. The visual elements are coherent, but are insufficient to overcome the conflict between internal validation and external evidence.  A lower confidence score is assigned due to the irreconcilable conflict between visual analysis (which is limited) and reliable external verification that indicates that the caption is incorrect.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly suggests the image shows President Trump at the border, but external validation contradicts this, showing a different person visiting the same area.  The lack of external support and the presence of contradictory evidence make the caption out of context."

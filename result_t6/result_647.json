While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) and concludes that the caption accurately reflects the image, showing a purple lobster. However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score 10) refuting this, indicating that the image of the purple lobster is digitally manipulated and the claim is a hoax.  The external evidence points to multiple news outlets initially reporting the image as genuine before the hoax was revealed.  This discrepancy highlights a significant conflict between the internal and external validation. The visual evidence alone is inconclusive; it shows a lobster that appears to be purple, but this is not sufficient to override the definitive external evidence that exposes the image as a hoax. Thus, the external validation carries more weight due to its investigative nature and fact-checking process.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because the image is not a genuine photograph of a purple lobster caught in Maine, as the caption implies. The high confidence score reflects the certainty that the external evidence convincingly demonstrates the image is a manipulated hoax, despite the initial visual interpretation supporting the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the caption, while external validation strongly refutes it, revealing the image as a digitally manipulated hoax.  External evidence is prioritized due to its reliable source and investigative nature, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

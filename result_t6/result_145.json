        "content": "Claim:\nOn Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration's desire to be on good terms with the European Union.\nApproximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.\nOne conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform's captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said.\nTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation  whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason  we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden's speech.\nConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:\n\"Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.\"\nWhile saying \"I'm eager to hear,\" Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant \"mmmm\" in the word \"I'm\" blended with the next word, \"eager,\" to make a \"mnnm-eager\" sound. That was the source of the social media posts' allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker's reason for saying it.\nA more plausible reason for the president's phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.\nOn several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound), according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.\nIn other words, the claim is false  Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.",

    "result": {

      "explanation": "The provided evidence from Snopes explicitly debunks the claim.  Snopes investigated the claim that President Biden used the n-word during a speech on February 19, 2021, at the Munich Security Conference.  Their investigation, which included reviewing a White House transcript and C-SPAN video, found the claim to be false.  The alleged use of the slur stemmed from a misinterpretation of Biden's stutter. ",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that the claim is false.  Snopes' investigation involved reviewing a White House transcript and C-SPAN footage of Biden's speech. They determined that the sound interpreted as the n-word was due to Biden's stutter.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The claim in the original caption is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  Internally, the image shows President Biden giving a seemingly standard speech, offering no visual corroboration of the alleged racial slur. The lack of context regarding the specific event and the absence of any visual indication of the slur significantly weakens the caption's credibility.  Externally, a comprehensive investigation by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking organization, decisively debunks the claim. Snopes' investigation reviewed transcripts and video footage from the speech in question, concluding that the claim is false and that the misinterpretation stems from Biden's known speech impediment.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check reinforces this conclusion. There is complete agreement between internal and external checks; both point towards the caption being out of context and factually inaccurate. The image itself contains no evidence to support the caption's assertion of a racial slur.  The caption's claim is not only unsupported but also directly contradicts reliable external fact-checking. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty; the evidence clearly points to the caption's inaccuracy and its out-of-context nature. The visual analysis, combined with the robust external fact-check, provides strong evidence supporting the conclusion that the original caption is completely unfounded.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute the original caption's claim. The image provides no visual evidence of the alleged event, while Snopes' investigation definitively debunks the claim."

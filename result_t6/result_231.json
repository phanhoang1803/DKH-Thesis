    "explanation": "The internal check found no visual evidence linking the image to the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash, resulting in a low confidence score and a verdict of False. The external check, while confirming the occurrence of the crash, did not provide direct visual verification of the image's relation to the event.  The discrepancy lies in the absence of visual evidence in the image itself that connects it to the crash.  The image depicts a fire and smoke, which is consistent with a crash, but lacks any specific details (wreckage, identifiable victims, location markers, etc.)  that would confirm its origin. The external checks provide context about the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash but do not validate this specific image as depicting that event. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support a claim that the image is of the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash. The low confidence score reflects the significant uncertainty based on the lack of visual confirmation and the mismatch between the internal and external verification results.  The significant difference between the confidence scores from internal (0) and external (8) checks points to a crucial lack of visual correspondence. The absence of any visual evidence in the image linking it directly to the helicopter crash is a critical factor in determining the out-of-context status.  The external sources merely confirm the event itself, not the image's authenticity as a depiction of it.  To summarize, the image's general consistency with a crash is outweighed by the lack of specific details that would conclusively tie it to the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash. The external corroboration alone is insufficient to establish a link without visual evidence. Thus, the caption is deemed out of context.",

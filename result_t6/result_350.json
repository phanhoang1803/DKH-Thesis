However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies the inability to verify the caption's claim solely from the image. The image depicts a large crowd, but offers no information regarding the event's location, date, or the identity of the person being rallied for.  The external check, however, presents strong evidence contradicting the caption. While the external source confirms a large Bernie Sanders rally in California, it specifies the location as Los Angeles in August 2015, not Sacramento in May 2016 as implied (or potentially misinterpreted) in the original caption. This discrepancy highlights a crucial difference: the caption's specificity regarding time and place is demonstrably false based on verifiable external information.  The visual evidence alone cannot confirm or deny the caption's claims due to lack of identifying details. The crowd size is consistent with both the described rally and other large public gatherings; therefore, the visual aspect is inconclusive.  The high confidence score of the external check stems from the availability of corroborating evidence regarding the existence of a large Sanders rally in California, even if the specific details in the original caption are incorrect.  The overall conclusion leans towards the caption being out-of-context because the key details—location and date—are inaccurate according to the external source.  The visual evidence is not sufficient to override this factual inaccuracy provided by the external source. Therefore, the caption is deemed out-of-context, reflecting a mistaken identification of the event. In summary, despite the image depicting a large rally,  the caption's specific claims are incorrect, making it out of context based on verifiable external information.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the image insufficient to verify the caption; external check confirms a California Sanders rally but contradicts the caption's specifics (location and date), resulting in a final judgment of 'out of context'."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a bear chasing a skier down a mountain in Romania in January 2021.\nRating:\nTrue\nAbout this rating\nIn 2016, a video went viral that supposedly showed a bear chasing a snowboarder down a mountain. Since that video was fake  it featured computer generated imagery  we were skeptical when we came across a similar video in January 2021 supposedly showing a bear chasing a skier down a mountain.\nThis is a real video.\nThe Romanian news outlet Digi 24 reported that this video was filmed on a ski slope in Predeal, Romania. The incident was filmed by multiple people on the chairlift who watched the scene unfold below. Digi 24 reports that the people on the chairlift yelled (translated via Google):\n\"Give it faster, give it faster! Come on, the bear is chasing you ! Give it faster! God forbid, don't look back!\"\nHere's another video of the incident:\nThe man in the video escaped unharmed.\nIon Zaharia, the county gendarmerie inspectorate, said that when the person realized what was happening, the skier threw a backpack on the ground. This distracted the bear and allowed the person to ski to safety.\nA video report from Obiectiv 3 shows the bear ending the pursuit after finding the bag.\nOfficials on the mountain said that they may  as they have done when similar situations arose in years past  attempt to relocate the bear away from the ski slopes.\nThis incident may seem unusual to some viewers as they have been told (incorrectly) that one way to evade a bear is to run (or ski) downhill. Bears, however, can run downhills at surprising speeds. According to the National Wildlife Federation, bears are nearly as fast as horses, and can reach speeds of 35 mph:\nMyth: Bears cant run downhill.\nIf youre being chased by a bear, dont run downhill! Bears can run as fast as a horse (35 mph), and they can do it uphill, downhill, and everything in between. A bear can outrun you no matter what, so if you see one in the wild do not try to run away from it. Instead, you should stand tall, wave your arms, and talk loudly but calmly. Back away slowly, but stop moving if the bear follows you.",

      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "Source 1 describes a bear chasing a skier down a mountain. While the caption mentions a bicyclist, the core event—a bear chasing a person downhill—is consistent.  The difference in the mode of transportation (skier vs. bicyclist) is a minor detail. The fact that the event is confirmed as real by Snopes significantly increases confidence.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds a high confidence (score 10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The image clearly shows a bear pursuing a cyclist on a mountain road. The internal validation's explanation directly supports this observation.\n\nThe external validation check, while less confident (score 8), corroborates the core event.  The external source mentions a similar event (bear chasing a person downhill) but with a skier instead of a cyclist. This difference is minor compared to the shared core element of a bear chasing someone downhill. The confirmation from Snopes that the video is real further supports the plausibility of the image. \n\nWhile the external source doesn't directly verify this *specific* image, it provides contextual evidence that similar events occur, lending credence to the image's authenticity. The minor discrepancy (cyclist vs. skier) doesn't negate the overall similarity and doesn't suggest the image is significantly out of context. The high internal confidence score, coupled with the supportive, albeit less precise, external evidence leads to the conclusion that the caption is not out of context. The visual elements of the image (cyclist, bear, mountain road) align directly with the caption. No signs of visual tampering or miscontextualization are apparent.\n\nThe difference in confidence scores between the internal and external checks is primarily due to the specificity of the external source.  The internal check is based solely on the direct visual correlation between the image and the caption. The external check relies on a similar but not identical event, requiring an inference to apply to the given image.  However, the external evidence strongly reinforces the basic narrative of a bear pursuing someone on a mountain road, thus supporting the internal validation conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation support the caption's accuracy. The external validation supports the core event described although with slightly different details. The overall assessment confirms the caption's accuracy and is not out of context."

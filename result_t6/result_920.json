The site includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says: World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\nThe made-up story, though, received more than 500,000 interactions on Facebook, including 47,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. It was also shared on YouTube and 4chan, an open, image-sharing forum, without the disclaimer. Some 4chan users commented that it was fake, but comments by others indicated that some thought it was real.\nThe bogus story states that Elena Travis, who is described as a 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist, officially broke the world record after receiving her 27th abortion. The photos that accompany the story are actually stock photos from Getty Images.\nAside from the misidentified photos and a disclaimer at the bottom of the story, there are other indications that the story is false. There is no byline on the story and the clinic mentioned as performing the historic operation does not seem to exist. A Google search for Sacramento Street Health Center yielded no results.\nWeve written once before about World News Daily Report and have included the website in our Misinformation Directory, which lists websites that spread misinformation on the internet.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\nA 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist has officially broken a world record after receiving her 27th abortion.

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that a 34-year-old pro-choice activist broke a world record by receiving her 27th abortion.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal validation finds no evidence within the image to support the caption's assertions. The image depicts a woman in a hospital bed, but provides no information regarding her age, political beliefs, or medical history. The caption's details are entirely fabricated and bear no relation to the visual content. The internal check gives a confidence score of 0, indicating complete lack of support for the caption from the image itself.\n\nExternal validation confirms the falsity of the claim. The external check, referencing a fact-checking source, definitively states that the news caption is false. The fact-checking source identifies the original story as originating from a satirical website known for publishing fictional content.  It highlights the lack of any real-world evidence, such as a verifiable clinic or verifiable patient details, further emphasizing the fabricated nature of the claim.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check underscores the certainty of the claim's falsity.\n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external validation results. Both methods unequivocally demonstrate that the caption is entirely out of context with the provided image.  The image is a generic photo of a woman in a hospital bed, while the caption presents a highly specific and unsubstantiated claim.  No visual manipulation or misrepresentation is detected in the image.  The lack of any supporting evidence, coupled with the external confirmation of the claim's falsity, strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly reject the caption's claim as false and fabricated. The image provides no supporting evidence, while external fact-checking confirms the claim originated from a satirical website."

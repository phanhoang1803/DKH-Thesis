        "content": "The idea for the project came from Nelson Nol, an entrepreneur who heads Sorocaba's prosthetic branch. He said that the calendar will be sold nationally, and the collected monies will cover not only cover the costs of the campaign, but will create a fund to help families who can not afford prosthetics. \"[The purpose] is to promote beauty, to show that you have life after amputation, and that these patients can lead full lives that include attending clubs, hanging out with friends, and dating,\" stresses Nol.\nThe goal is to show that amputation is only a detail, and that beauty is a matter of attitude. The pictures are all in black and white, but the prostheses will be featured in vivid color images. The initiative is a way to show that physical limitations can not take away a woman's most valuable asset: pride.\nBanker Jaqueline Felizberto opened up in the photographs. She lost her right leg at seven years old when she was hit by a truck in front of her house. But the trauma has not hindered her life. \"I have a normal life: super, super busy, well run. I really enjoy my makeup, go out and have fun. I love the beach. I like to enjoy a lot,\" says the banker turned model for a day.\nCamile Rodrigues was born with a malformed leg, but that did not stop her from becoming a top athlete. At the Pan-American Games in 2011, the swimmer took three silver medals and one bronze. For her, the concept of beauty has little to do with aesthetics. \"Beauty to me is happiness. I think if you're happy, you're beautiful.\"",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation processes both strongly suggest that the original caption is inaccurate.  The internal check identified a mismatch between the image content (women with prosthetic legs) and the caption's claim of \"wounded female veterans.\" The lack of visual cues confirming military affiliation or veteran status in the photograph was noted. The confidence score of 10 reflects the high degree of certainty in this assessment.  The external validation reinforced this finding by citing a source (Snopes.com) that explicitly states the image depicts Brazilian amputees, not wounded U.S. female veterans.  The external check had a lower confidence score (2) possibly due to the limited scope of the external source. However, the convergence of both checks—internal and external—leads to a strong conclusion. There is no ambiguity or contradiction between the visual evidence and the results from both internal and external validation, all pointing toward the caption being factually incorrect. No visual manipulation or miscontextualization is evident. The women's attire and setting do not offer clues to confirm or refute their military background. The internal and external validations' combined findings provide sufficient evidence that the image caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations independently confirm that the caption is inaccurate. The image shows women with prosthetic legs, but there's no evidence to support the claim that they are wounded female veterans. External verification from Snopes.com explicitly identifies the women as Brazilian amputees."

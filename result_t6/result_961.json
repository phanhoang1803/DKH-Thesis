        "content": "Uproar as prominent Tunisian activist gets suspended jail term\nPolitical and human rights groups have criticised the sentencing of prominent Tunisian activist and opposition figure Chaima Issa by a military court.\nThe court on Wednesday handed Issa a one-year suspended prison sentence for offending Tunisia's President Kais Saied.\nShe was also found guilty of spreading rumours to harm public security and inciting soldiers to disobey orders, the AFP news agency reported, citing Issa's lawyer Dalila Ben Mbarek.\nAmnesty International has termed Issa's conviction \"outrageous\", adding that \"her case was brought by an increasingly repressive government that will stop at nothing to silence voices of dissent\".\nAmnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Issa's party, The National Salvation Front, have also criticised Issa's trial and sentencing by a military court, even though she is a civilian.\n\"Tunisian authorities should immediately stop prosecuting activists simply for criticising President Kais Saied's power grab and unjustly trying civilians before military courts,\" Human Rights Watch said.\nPresident Saied has been accused of authoritarian practices including cracking down on dissenters since he dissolved parliament and the government in 2021, granting himself more powers.\nHundreds of ADF fighters killed in Uganda strikes - Museveni\nUgandan troops killed about 200 ADF fighters in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as the military operations to flush out the Islamic State group-affiliated militants continue, Uganda's president said.\n\"We have been carrying out air attacks on the terrorists in Congo,\" President Yoweri Museveni said on X, formerly Twitter, adding that around \"200 of them were killed\" in strikes carried out on 16 September.\nMore strikes against the fighters have been carried out since then, Mr Museveni added, without giving further details.\nUgandan army spokesperson Felix Kulayigye told AFP news agency that the president was referring to the ADF jihadists.\nIn 2021, Uganda and the DR Congo launched a joint military offensive against ADF in eastern DR Congo, but the group still carries out attacks in both countries.\nIn October, two tourists, a British man and a South African woman on their honeymoon, as well as their guide, were killed while on safari in Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack.\nIn June, 42 people, including 37 pupils, were killed in an attack on a secondary school in western Uganda, also attributed to the ADF.\nRamaphosa to challenge court ruling on Zulu king\nSouth Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa will appeal against a court ruling that his crowning of the new Zulu king was unlawful and invalid, his office has said.\n\"During the course of these legal processes, His Majesty King Misuzulu remains the identified heir to the throne,\" it added in a statement.\nKing Misuzulu's claim to the throne was challenged in the Pretoria High Court by his half-brother, Prince Simakade Zulu, who says he is the rightful heir.\nThe late King Goodwill Zwelithini died in 2021, sparking a vicious power struggle between the brothers for the throne.\nKing Misuzulu appeared to have won the succession battle - especially after his traditional coronation in August 2022 was followed by a state ceremony two months later, when Mr Ramaphosa gave him a certificate of recognition in front of tens of thousands of people.\nOn Monday, the Pretoria High Court ruled that the president had not followed proper procedures before recognising King Misuzulu as the monarch.\nIt said Mr Ramaphosa had failed to comply with the law, which required him to order an investigation into objections to the accession.\nRussia laundered $2.5bn from 'blood gold' - report\nRichard Hamilton\nBBC World Service newsroom\nA new report accuses Russia of laundering around $2.5bn (2bn) from what it calls African Blood Gold, since the start of the war in Ukraine.\nThe Blood Gold report , externalaccuses mercenaries from the Wagner group of generating more than $100m a month in revenue for the Kremlin through the illegal gold trade in the Central African Republic (CAR), Sudan and Mali.\nThe report was compiled by a research team led by African-European relations expert Jessica Berlin.\nIt says the military junta in Mali - which relies on mining companies for most of its revenue - pays Wagner mercenaries in cash.\nIn CAR and Sudan, the Kremlin relies on complex smuggling routes to extract large amounts of gold from Africa to Russia and the UAE where it can be mixed with legitimate sources of gold and then converted into cash, the report says.\nRussia has not commented on the allegations.\nRead: Inside Wagner's African 'success story'\nNorth African Jews celebrate 'Festival of Daughters'\nAmie Liebowitz\nBBC News\nJews in North Africa have today been celebrating a holiday dedicated to young women.\nIt's called Eid El Bannat in Arabic (or Chag HaBanot in Hebrew) - which roughly translates to Festival of Daughters.\nThe holiday coincides with the new moon in the month of Tevet, according to the Jewish calendar, and is also observed by Jewish people in Spain, Portugal and parts of the Middle East.\nAlthough it is celebrated during a more widely-known Jewish holiday, Hannukah, Eid El Bannat is unique and culturally specific.\nOn the big day, women of all ages gather to rest and enjoy each other's company. The holiday's overarching purpose is to celebrate the lives of women and focus on female empowerment.\nSinging, reciting poetry, dancing and eating are customary - and all this takes place without the presence of men.\nIn some countries, like Tunisia, girls that have recently turned 12 will group together and celebrate their Bat Mitzvah, or coming of age ceremony, on Eid El Bannat.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sephardic Moroccan artist La La Tamar said that in different countries they have varied rituals, but in Morocco and Tunisia its mainly for the bachelorettes\".\n\"They make a lot of sweets and give each other gifts. They sit in a circle and learn about different heroic Jewish women,\" she said.\n\"As a woman in the modern world, any chance to explore that space is a precious opportunity for experiencing something that is almost lost in our modern society, she added.\nTo learn more about this holiday, listen to the Focus on Africa podcast on BBC Sounds.\nHunger catastrophe looms in war-hit Sudan - WFP\nEarlier, we reported that a further 170 people have died in Ethiopia's Tigray region as a drought continues to grip the Horn of Africa.\nThe UN's food agency has now said Sudan, Ethiopia's neighbour, has the highest level of hunger ever recorded during its harvest season.\nIt said Sudan was edging towards a hunger catastrophe, made worse by a months-long war between the army and a rival paramilitary group.\nLeni Kinzli, a spokesperson from the World Food Programme, told the BBC: \"The conflict needs to end now because we are seeing a situation that is spiralling out of control.\n\"These record levels of hunger, twice as much as there was the same time last year, in a situation where there were already existing drivers of food insecurity, the conflict, the ongoing fighting, is just compounding all of that, making it so, so much worse for already so vulnerable populations.\"\nRead more: Conditions worse than ever seven months into Sudan civil war\nSeveral injured at DR Congo opposition rally\nSeveral people in DR Congo have been injured following clashes at a rally held by leading opposition presidential candidate Moise Katumbi in Mwanda city in the south-west.\nMr Katumbi suspended part of his campaign following the clashes, which mark an escalation in tension ahead of elections on 20 December.\nThere are conflicting accounts of what happened at Tuesday's rally.\nThe provincial government said in a statement that Mr Katumbi's guards fired warning shots after the crowd grew rowdy.\nJostling ensued, the government said, therefore police used tear gas to restore order.\nThe statement said several people were injured, including a police officer.\nHowever Mr Katumbi alleged on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"The images, the live ammunition fired by the police, and the testimonies confirm that these incidents were programmed, planned and orchestrated with a desire to commit crime.\"\nAlmost 44 million people are registered to vote in an election that will determine whether incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi will stay in power after a first term marred by economic hardship and insecurity.\nMr Katumbi, a wealthy businessman and former governor, is one of Mr Tshisekedi's main rivals in the race.\nRead more: DR Congo election 2023: What you need to know\nPoor conditions fuel deaths among Uganda's teachers - union\nBBC Newsday\nWorld Service radio\nThe Uganda National Teachers Union has said there has been a high number of deaths among teachers, mainly caused by ill health due to poor working conditions.\nAccording to the union, more than 1,000 teachers in the country have died in the last two years. It said Uganda is at risk of facing a shortage of teachers by 2025 as poor conditions push more and more teachers out of the profession.\n\"These deaths are as a result of the working and living conditions. There are stress factors in relation to the pressure of work, because it is overwhelming,\" Baguma Filbert Bates, the General Secretary of Uganda's National Teachers Union told BBC's Newsday programme.\nHe added that Ugandan teachers are constantly stressed by an overwhelming workload caused by understaffing, as well as a paycheck of about 490,000 Ugandan shillings ($125; 100) per month. Mr Bates said this amount is inadequate in sustaining teachers and their families in the current economic environment.\nHe said the union has repeatedly urged the government to improve teachers' welfare, which would in turn boost the quality of education received by students.\n\"Whenever there is need for political priorities, money is found. Therefore, we cannot say the Ugandan child should be sacrificed because of the economy,\" Mr Bates said.\nUgandan serial killer sentenced to 105 years in prison\nThe High Court in Uganda's capital, Kampala, has sentenced a 25-year-old serial killer to 105 years in prison.\nMusa Musasizi was sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty to the murder of three women said to be his girlfriends and a three-month-old girl who was the child of one of his victims.\nHe reportedly pursued romantic relationships with the women before sexually assaulting and killing them, then burning and disposing of their bodies, the court heard.\nJustice Margaret Mutonyi said the long sentence was necessary to protect young women, including Musasizi's six-year-old daughter, the privately-owned NTV channel reported.\nMusasizi had been arrested in March 2021 on suspicion of killing five women and an infant.\nHe was convicted for the murder of one of the women in July.\nAt that time, his lawyer asked the judge for mercy, saying that Musasizi, a former street child, had survived a difficult upbringing.\nNiger sets deadline for French troops withdrawal\nYusuf Akinpelu\nBBC News\nNigers junta has said French soldiers remaining in the country should complete their withdrawal by 22 December.\nThe remaining 157 troops are mainly from teams covering logistics, the junta said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). It added that 1,346 French military personnel have already left the country.\nThere have been tensions between France and Niger following the 26 July coup, led by Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, that deposed democratically-elected president and French ally Mohamed Bazoum.\nFrance began to pull its troops out from Niger in October. The junta had ordered the French to leave, having accused the European nation of trying to reinstate President Bazoum by force.\nThe military leaders also said they plan to end some historical military and economic agreements with Paris.\nNiger was seen as one of the Wests last allies in the Sahel region in the war against terror.\nFrances influence in the area has been waning following a wave of coups across some of its former colonies.\nM23 rebels welcome ceasefire ahead of DR Congo elections\nBBC Monitoring\nThe world through its media\nThe M23 rebel group has agreed to honour a three-day US-brokered ceasefire deal with the Democratic Republic of Congo's army.\nThe groups spokesman, Lawrence Kanyuka, said in a statement on X, external (formerly Twitter) that the rebels accepted the deal since it is in line with the M23's existing signed ceasefire of 7 March 2023.\nThe rebel group had not consulted about the deal before its completion, according to Mr Kanyuka.\nDespite agreeing to the ceasefire, the M23 said they would \"not hesitate\" to defend themselves - and the civillian populations under their control - from the army or government-allied militia.\nThe ceasefire began on Monday midday, according to a statement, external by US National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson.\nIt comes one week ahead of hotly contested elections in the central African country. Authorities have said voting cannot take place in the eastern territories of Rutshuru and Masisi, as they are in the grip of the conflict with the M23.\nAnd on Tuesday, the electoral commission announced that those displaced by the conflict will also not be able to vote.\nPrevious ceasefire deals between the rebels and army have been breached, leading to fresh fighting.\nEgypts Sisi takes poll lead as vote count begins\nEgypt's electoral body has started counting votes following the conclusion of polling in the presidential elections.\nVoting began on Sunday and ended at 21:00 local time on Tuesday (19:00 GMT), with more than 67 million people registered to vote.\nIncumbent President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is seeking a third consecutive term.\nAlthough three other candidates are vying for the presidency, many Egyptians believe Mr Sisi will easily win a new six-year term in office.\nEarly provisional results have already placed Mr Sisi in the lead.\nThe official results are set to be announced on 18 December.\nRead more on Egypt's election:\nEgypt election: Discontent grows as Sisi seeks third term\nCameroon army rescues kidnapped, 'tortured' students\nPaul Njie\nBBC News, Yaound\nEight male students who had been abducted by suspected separatists from a school in the war-torn Anglophone north-west region of Cameroon have been freed, authorities say.\nAbdoullahi Aliou, a local administrator, said the armed men stormed the school in Esu area on Tuesday and \"tortured\" the students before abducting them.\nTwo classrooms and the principal's offices were set on fire during the attack. Some school officials, including the deputy principal, were also kidnapped.\nSeveral students who sustained injuries are being treated in hospital.\nThe eight students who were kidnapped were all freed following the intervention of defence and security forces, Mr Aliou said, without providing details of the whereabouts of the deputy principal and other school officials.\nFor over six years now, separatists have imposed and enforced a school boycott in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon. The separatists see schools as an arm of the French-speaking-majority's rule.\nThe separatists have attacked students and teachers who defy their orders.\nNo group has so far claimed responsibility for Tuesdays attack.\nMore than 700,000 children have lost access to education after the closure of several schools since the conflict began in 2017, according to the UN.\nAbout 6,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the conflict, the International Crisis Group said.\nDR Congo signs carbon credit deal covering Congo basin\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo has signed an agreement with a US company for a carbon credit deal covering the Congo Basin rainforest and peatlands.\ndClimate, a \"climate information and data infrastructure\" company, said it will support DR Congo to preserve the Basin by reducing deforestation. The deal is aimed at preserving more than 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the forest.\nIn recent years, environmentalists have raised alarm over the depletion of thousands of acres in the Congo Basin through deforestation.\nAs the second-largest rainforest in the world, it absorbs over 1.5 billion tonnes of CO annually. Experts say preserving the Congo Basin is integral in global efforts to slow climate change and maintain biodiversity.\nCarbon credits work like this: an organisation that pollutes can buy a credit which is worth one tonne of carbon dioxide.\nThe money paid by the organisation is meant to go towards carbon-lowering schemes, so for every tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted, the credit represents a tonne of CO2 that was captured.\nIn this way, the overall amount of (CO2) and other pollutants produced is supposed to stay the same, or even be lowered.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in carbon-offsetting companies taking control of land in sub-Saharan Africa for multi-year carbon-credit projects. Some critics question whether credits represent genuine carbon reductions and also whether they benefit local people.\ndClimate said it will help DR Congo develop a carbon registry - a system through which the government will track and sell credits.\n\"dClimate will lease the carbon sequestration rights for an initial 10-year period but will not lease or buy the land, thus preserving the national sovereignty and the rights of local communities,\" the company said on Tuesday, following the signing of the agreement at the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai.\nThe credits produced during the decade-long partnership will be worth an estimated $1bn, dClimate's co-founder Siddhartha Jha told Bloomberg.\nThe company will retain 10% to 20% of generated revenue.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that the image depicts gold miners backstage at an event in Mali.  Internal validation reveals a discrepancy: while the image shows women in Mali, there is no visual evidence suggesting they are gold miners. The women are elegantly dressed and appear to be participating in some sort of formal event.  The internal check has a high confidence score (10) due to the clear visual incongruity between the caption and the image content.\n\nExternal validation strengthens this discrepancy.  External sources provide no corroborating evidence of a news story about gold miners waiting backstage at an event in Mali. The lack of such news reports reduces the confidence score for external validation to 3. This may be due to the lack of specificity in the caption; a more precise description of the event could potentially yield more positive results, but the present caption is too vague for a strong external confirmation.\n\nDespite the difference in confidence scores, both internal and external checks consistently support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image displays women in formal attire, in a setting not indicative of a gold mining context. The absence of supporting external news further strengthens the case against the accuracy of the original caption. Considering the strong visual incongruence and lack of external confirmation, we can confidently state that the caption is out of context, with a high degree of certainty.",

      "explanation": "Don Moen is a known Christian music artist, making a performance in Kigali plausible.  However, without specific sources confirming the event, the claim remains unverifiable. The phrasing \"early next year\" lacks specific dates, making it difficult to assess temporal accuracy.  Past performance history and announcements from Don Moen or relevant Kigali event organizers would be needed to confirm the information.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal validation expresses high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on the image showing Don Moen, aligning with his public persona. However, the external validation reveals a significant lack of corroborating evidence to support the claim of a Kigali performance.  There's no mention of this specific event on Don Moen's official website, social media, or news articles covering his tour schedule.  The absence of verifiable external sources casts considerable doubt on the claim's veracity despite the internal consistency.  The internal validation's high confidence score stems from a strong correlation between the image and the caption's description of Don Moen's identity and profession.  The mention of 'early next year' lacks specificity and hinders verification efforts.  While the image itself is not tampered with and appropriately shows Don Moen performing, it doesn't offer explicit geographical context (Kigali). To conclude, the discrepancy between the high internal confidence (based solely on image content) and the low external confidence (due to a lack of supporting evidence) necessitates a conservative assessment. The lack of external confirmation significantly weakens the caption's credibility, leading to an 'out of context' designation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy based on the image content. However, external validation fails to confirm the specific Kigali performance, creating a major discrepancy.  The lack of concrete evidence and specifics (dates) ultimately outweighs the internal consistency, leading to a low confidence score and an 'OOC' judgment."

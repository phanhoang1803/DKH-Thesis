        "content": "WARTIME EXPERIENCES\n1939 - 46\n'The day War broke out', as comedian Robb Wilton used to say, was the day of the Straw family day out. We had hired a coach and were going to spend the day on and by the Trent at Laneham Ferry. It was a beautiful morning and a glorious day of warm sunshine and the bluest of blue skies. Before we left home we heard Neville Chamberlain's broadcast message to the Nation informing us that he had sent an ultimatum to Herr Hitler that if he did not cease hostilities against Poland a state of War would exist between Great Britain and Germany. We had not illusions as to the outcome of this request. Nevertheless the 40 odd Straws and their adherents set out determined to enjoy their excursion and each others' company regardless of what the future might hold. If War came today who knows when the family would be together again, and who would be missing the next family outing? And so we enjoyed the sunshine, the laughter, the shining river, the grassy banks and all the beautiful day, except for the sombre moment when, crowded round a cottage door we listened to the sad voice of Chamberlain announcing that no reply had come from German Chancellor and that therefore Great Britain was at war with Germany. 'Everything that I have worked for', he said 'Everything that I have hoped for, everything that I have believed in during my public life has crashed into ruins'. It was not a speech to rouse the nation: it was left to another, a greater man, to put courage into the heart of the nation, and stiffen its resolve. Such a man was Winston Churchill.\nAt the end of this momentous day we boarded the coach for home: as we drove down Prince of Wales Road, the whole Don Valley lay at our feet, clear and unclouded as it could be only on Saturday and Sunday evenings. This evening there was one great difference in the scene, at once comforting and disturbing; the valley was crowded with the grey, buoyant shapes of the barrage balloons turning gently in the light breeze and reflecting the glow of the setting sun.\nDuring the night we were awakened out of a deep sleep by the wailing of air raid sirens. We had heard these during daytime trials, but in the middle of the night, between waking and sleeping, they had a sinister, bloodcurdling note not noticed before. At this time my cousin Alice was keeping house for Uncle Fred and myself. We dressed hurriedly and dashed across the street to the nearest Anderson shelter. Mr and Mrs Scarratt and several neighbours were already there and the burden of the conversation was that Hitler had lost no time in beginning his aerial attacks on Britain. After a short time, however, the 'allclear' sounded and we all returned to bed. The local morning paper announced that the alert was a false alarm. Was it really the result of a shaky finger on the button, or had the marauding planes been driven back and the 'false alarm' story invented for morale purposes? This is what we asked ourselves.\nThe next seven months were what were known as the 'phoney' war. The expected onslaught on Britain by the Luft waffe did not materialise. Hitler was too busy with Poland and with dividing the spoils with Stalin, while later he invaded Norway and Denmark. This latter campaign resulted in an abortive landing of British troops on Norwegian soil, and their dismal withdrawal ending in complete German victory. Our troops in France were kicking their heels, whilst the French were manning their Maginot Line defences in the mistaken belief that they were impregnable. On the 10th May 1940 news came that the attack on the West had begun and that German troops were streaming across Holland; that night the King sent for Winston Churchill and asked him to form a Government. The phoney war was over, a vacillating and ineffectual Prime Minister was replaced by a courageous and resourceful leader who would rally the Nation at its most crucial and 'finest' hour. But I am running ahead of myself. We shall reach the 10 May 1940 later in my story.\nSome weeks after the beginning of the War I received notice that on a date in October I was to attend at the local Employment Exchange to be registered with the 22 age group for service in H.M. Forces. When I informed my boss of this he asked me if I wanted him to write to the appropriate authority claiming that I was employed on work of national importance (as the company itself was being engaged in forgings for the Air Ministry, Ministry of Supply and Navy). He was very pleased when I refused his offer and said that the company could surely find elderly incapacitated, or female clerks to take over my job, and that I would prefer to do my duty to the country in the Forces. I thus registered for War service giving, for my preference, the Army.\nIn December 1939 I was requested to attend the Cutlers Hall for a medical examination on New Years Day 1940. Just before Christmas I went down with the worst attack of influenza I can remember having. It was only two days before the medical that I felt able to get up and sit by the fire. I suppose I ought to have applied for a postponement but I attended on the appointed day and was adjudged A1 although my weight was down to 7 stones 7lbs (after 2 months in the army I was up at 10 stones, a stone heavier that I had ever been. The result, no doubt, of regular exercise, fresh air and no nonsense Army food).\nTHE ARMY\nTRAINING IN HUDDERSFIELD\nOn the 18th January 1940, in the midst of the worse winter for decades, I was called up to the 2/7th Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment, Motto 'Virtutis Fortuna Comes', literally translated 'Bravery the comrade of Good luck', or more popularly 'Fortune favours the Brave'. A Regiment noted for long service in India hence its elephant lapel badges - and for it s prowess in inter-services Rugby football and boxing.\nThe morning was cold and grey with snow lying on the pavements as I walked up Clifton Street to meet Mr Hartle - Vera's father - who was to accompany me to the railway station, being on night shift that week. The only person I saw on the street was Mrs Rivers who said 'Good luck, lad, look after yourself'. I only needed the clothes I was wearing, so my little compressed paper overnight case contained only spare vest and pants, a clean shirt, handkerchiefs, writing paper and envelopes, shaving tackle, the New Testament they had given me at chapel, and a steel mirror my father had used in the trenches during the first World War. When we arrived at Victoria Station (no longer in existence) the platform was crowded with young men of my own age, all carrying little cases or parcels. Some were accompanied by their wives or sweethearts, or by mothers, fathers or other relatives. Vera would have liked to come and see me off but she couldn't get leave off work, and in some ways I was glad she was spared the ordeal. John Armitage came to say 'so long' which was very good of him. There was no one on the train that I knew but I struck up a conversation with a young chap who was being called up to the R.A.M.C. - Royal Army Medical Corps, cruelly nicknamed in the first World War ' Rob All My Comrades', because there were maliciously accused of robbing the dead or dying who came into their care. As many of these brave lads were conscientious objectors, Quakers some of them, this was a shocking calumny. Arriving in Leeds, we marched a mile or so to Gibraltar Barracks where we were to be sorted like so many letters and posted to our units (an undeliberate pun!). Having given my name and future Regiment I was told to wait around until my name was called. This was ten o'clock in the morning: at eight in the evening I was eventually called, together with about 20 others, and paraded back to the railway station. By this time I had experienced the novelty of drinking tea out of a mess-tin, and I had made a friend. This was a large, fresh-complexioned chap from Chichester, called Dougie Dart. He had been called up to Leeds from Hull where he had been working as a Customs Officer, boarding ships and searching them for contraband goods. In those days it was more likely to be tobacco, spirits, precious stones and silk than hard drugs. It is funny what the memory retains: I clearly remember him saying that when he first went in to digs he used to be terribly embarrassed putting out his laundry for his landlady because of what we now include under the euphemism 'biological stains'.\nIt was, of course, dark when we boarded the train for our unknown destination - could it be Cornwall or perhaps Scotland? and in the blackout we could see no names on the stations through which we rushed. We were not very long in finding out: the train stopped, two N.C.O.s came into the carriages, checked that we were all 'Dukes', marched us out of the station, and there we were - in Huddersfield! It was bitterly cold as we marched through the darkened streets singing, with youthful enthusiasm, to our destination. This proved to be the Yorkshire Dragoons' (Territorials) Drill Hall in Fitzwilliam Street, a medium sized hall with a stage at one end and a balcony at the other. It was about 10 o'clock.\nWe were ushered into a small sideroom where there was a heap of rough hessian palliasse covers: alas there was no straw left - what irony - and no more available that night. There were two dingy army blankets each, however, so Dougie and I decided to pool our resources by using the empty palliasse covers and two blankets to lie on, and two blankets to cover us, using our civilian clothes as pillows apart from our overcoats which we used as auxiliary blankets. As we were the last party to arrive the main part of the hall was pretty well covered with 'beds', so we made ourselves as comfortable as we could on the balcony and, as there was no sign of food or drink, decided to settle down for the night. I was in no way brimming over with contentment having left home and fiance for an unknown and precarious future - and being hungry into the bargain! Sleep, however, was not long in coming. But it didn't last very long!\nAbout midnight we were awakened by shouts and the banging of doors: all the lights of the hall came on and in marched - a trifle unsteadily - an officer (the Orderly officer we discovered), and two Sergeants. After enquiring whether we were comfortable, which we were to a limited degree considering the lack of straw in our palliasse covers, he asked us if we had had supper, which we hadn't! He thereupon called out the cookhouse staff from their no doubt warm and comfortable beds and ordered them to make us cocoa and give us a doorstep slice of bread. I can't remember what was on the bread but whatever it was it was most acceptable and satisfied the pangs of hunger we had been trying to forget in sleep. After this we would have been happy to settle down to sleep again. But no! We were to be 'entertained' by the 'dis-orderly trio'. We had to join in singing 'Bless 'em all', 'Roll out the Barrel' and a new song to us which we were to hear hundreds of times in the next six years. This was 'The Quartermaster's Stores', an Army song of many and variable verses, often obscene, but with a constant chorus. Here is a respectable sample (adjectives can be changed according to taste or lack of it) -\nVerse There were rats, rats as big as tabby cats\nIn the stores, in the stores\nThere was cheese, cheese that brought you to your knees\nIn the Quartermaster stores\nRefrain My eyes are dim I cannot see\nI have not brought my specs with me\nI have no...ot brought my specs with me\nThe remainder of the impromptu concert consisted of dirty stories, and an impersonation of Adolf Hitler which would have been banned by any censor however broadminded. Like the Kaiser in the 1914/18 War, Hitler was first portrayed in the popular press as a much over rated figure of fun, and ended as a detested embodiment of evil. I often wondered whether this was a flaw in our national character, as witness the childish popular songs of the 'phoney' war, 'We're going to hang out the washing on the Siegfried Line', 'Run, rabbit, run' and 'Who do you think you are kidding Mr Hitler' etc but perhaps it was a strength and not a weakness.\nEventually the 'entertainers' ran out of steam, and we settled down again to sleep 6 am came too quickly and with it the exhortations of the 'Regular Army' N.C.O.s to 'rise and shine', 'get those cold feet on to the warm floor' and other less choice injunctions.\nBundles of blankets unrolled to reveal their occupants, heavy eyed and tousled-haired, scratching themselves, yawning and blinking in the light of the naked light bulbs. There was a general reluctance to move but the fear that something dire might befall us if the N.C.O.s returned spurred us into action. There was a rush to use the limited ablution facilities, and the difficulty in getting washed and shaved (in cold water) in such crowded conditions made me resolve to be up at the first notes of Reveille, or before if possible, to have a wash and shave in comparative comfort. I stuck to that resolve all the time we were in training. After ablutions an N.C.O. came round and showed us how to fold our blankets to Army regulation shape and size. Later, when we had got our full equipment, we were shown how they were to be displayed on and around the blankets for morning inspection. 'Stand by your beds' became the first order of the day after Reveille. Woe betide you then if everything was not squared up in military fashion, your spare boots gleaming brightly and the exposed buttons on your greatcoat dazzling with reflected light. We were beginning to know the true meaning of 'bull'. On this first morning, however, we were treated very gently: we were led off to the mess room and there allocated our tables, plain wooden trestle tables accommodating ten men. We were to take it in turn, on a daily basis, to be waiter to our mess mates: this was job I didn't relish at all. All eyes were fixed on the portions served out by the 'waiter' to ensure that no one received a larger portion of, say, mashed potatoes than anyone else, or that no-one was given short measure. This first morning, as we had not yet been issued with mess tins, we were given plates. The first course was porridge, sweetened, in the absence of sugar with black treacle! This was followed by bacon and egg, and fried bread, and a mug of very strong tea sweetened with condensed milk. At home there were quite a lot of things that I didn't eat, onions, carrots and cabbage being especially disliked. The Army cured me of all that ! Hours of hard exercise in the fresh air worked up tremendous appetites and I thankfully ate everything that was put in front of me.\nAfter this first breakfast we were paraded into the drill Hall where we were to give our personal details to one of a number of N.C.O.s who were seated behind a long trestle table. Here we - were also given our Army number, one that is etched on my memory, 4618821. One of the questions asked was, 'Civilian occupation?'. When I answered 'Book-keeper', the eyes of the elderly sergeant in front of me lost their look of boredom. 'Good', he said 'You'll come in very handy when the flat season starts'. He was most disappointed when I explained the difference between a book-keeper and a bookmaker, and I'm sure I went down in his estimation. My occupation was remembered, however, a few weeks later when they set up a Battalion canteen and I was detailed to run it and keep the accounts.\nIt appeared that the formalities were now over: we were now definitely and unretrievably (short of a miracle) in the Army, though we were told on many occasions in the future that we were not b.... soldiers, but that, by God, they would make us soldiers before they'd finished!\nOur next port of call was the Quartermaster's stores. Here we were fitted (ha ha) with our uniforms - one set of battledress and one of working denim - two vests, two shirts (no collars - or ties - for other ranks until 1945), two pairs of long johns, one pullover, one pair of boots, one pair of plimsolls, pair of braces, one forage cap and the cap badge to go with it. We were then issued with our steel helmet, greatcoat, mess-tins, cutlery, button-stick, housewife (no, not a camp follower, this one was -pronounced 'hussif' and was a hold all with thread, needle, pins etc for minor mending and darning operations), gas mask in exchange for our 'budgie boxes' and gas cape and groundsheet. Later in the day we attended at the Armoury to collect our rifles, Lee Enfields of 1914/1918 vintage which had been in store for years and which we therefore had to spend hours degreasing and cleaning before they could be used. This kind of chore, together with cleaning and shining of boots, buttons and bayonet scabbards etc were done in the spare time between tea and bedtime. Many were the hours sat 'boning' our boot toe-caps to remove the orange peel surface of the leather, with toothbrush handle, shoe polish and spit, to achieve the mirror finish so beloved by the sergeant major. The same technique was later applied to our bayonet scabbards; in this case the problem was to remove the grease in which they had been stored. It was some weeks before we got the latter, however, with the webbing equipment we needed to complete the fighting man's outfit: belt and strapping, large (back) pack, small (side) pack, two large magazine pouches - large enough for Bren ammunition magazines as well as clips of .303 rounds - and bayonet 'frog'. And I forgot one important item of equipment we received - the kit bag.\nIt didn't strike me at the time but I have since thought that it was more than a little unfair that someone of my height and weight should have had to carry the same weight of equipment as men much taller and heavier than I was. I must have been tougher than I thought!\nThe rest of that first day was given up to lectures and demonstrations on the use of our equipment, and we were initiated into the delights of square-bashing and arms drill, although the artic conditions outside continued for weeks on end and it was only towards the end of March that we could extend our training to include fieldwork and other essentially outdoor activities.\nIt was so cold that when we were able to venture out to do arms drill on the street behind the Hall, we could only manage five minutes of drill at a time before grounding our rifles and running up and down the street slapping each other on the back to restore the circulation in our hands and feet. Handling rifles in sub-zero conditions is no laughing matter. Similarly when we were marched down to the Public Baths for our morning P.T. session it was a matter of slipping, sliding and falling down rather than a disciplined march.\nMidway through February the roads out of Huddersfield were in a very bad state and the road to Wakefield and Barnsley was completely blocked by snow at the village of Flockton. Huddersfield Corporation asked for the help of the Army to clear the road and we were sent, with a supply of Corporation shovels, and a packed lunch, to do our stuff (we were promised Union rates of pay, but what materialised was a packet of fags each - and I didn't even smoke!) When we arrived within walking distance of the blockage we found that there were drifts six feet high - no exaggeration. By lunchtime we were wet through but reasonably warm from our exertions spurred on by the sight of the local pub on the other side of the drifts. Our only amusement of the morning was the sight of our officer falling through the snow. He had been standing on the top of high drift giving instructions ignorant of the fact that one of his men, out of sight, was deliberately undercutting the drift to the point where the surface gave way. The officer landed on his feet, unhurt in all but his dignity! I suppose all the snow digging, two days of it, with the rest of our physical activities, P.T. etc was good stamina training. I know I had never felt so fit in all my life: I had even got rid of my previously chronic catarrh.\nTo return to that first week. When we were issued with our uniform we were given brown paper and string with which to send home our 'civvies'. Because we Sheffield chaps were nearer home than the rest of the 'intake' many of them from Hull - we were given a pass to go home on the Saturday lunchtime until 'lights out' on Sunday. This was a pleasant surprise and no one was more delighted than Vera when I walked through the door, resplendent in, and not a little self-conscious of, my brand new uniform. I had a different kind of surprise, however, when I arrived back in barracks at about nine o'clock on Sunday evening to give in my pass to the Orderly Corporal. There waiting for me was a particularly nasty corporal - an exception to the others - who said I was on a charge for being Absent without Leave, and for failing to report for cookhouse duties on Saturday night. It gave me great satisfaction to produce my pass, but I insisted in handing it over to the Orderly Corporal myself. I didn't want it to mysteriously disappear.\nMost week-ends thereafter, however, I did disappear after morning church parade on Sundays to catch the bus to Sheffield. It meant I had only six hours at home but I felt it was worth all the trouble. Before I slipped off I made certain that I was not up on Orders for any duties or fatigues. You have to learn quickly in the Army to survive!\nOne thing above all others that makes life in the Army bearable, and often enjoyable, is the comradeship, the esprit de corps you find, and help to make, in your unit, section or platoon. I was very fortunate in finding, so quickly, a friend like Dougie Dart, but there were many others, some whose faces I can still see but whose names I can't recall. I do remember of course Harry Yates, whom I got to know because his mother was a colleague of Vera's in the Girls Brigade; Pat O'Brien, Gerry Winters whose father was a pawnbroker at Upperthorpe, Eric Smith whom I still see at the Victoria Hall, and a good friend who died, sadly, in his fifties, Ron Gibson. Other friends I met up with later in my service were Don Pashley, still in Sheffield, who was a contemporary at K.E.S. and Ron Eady, a professional entomologist at the Kensington Natural History Museum, who died suddenly about seven years ago. All these, and many more, helped me through the War as I hope I was able to help them in some way. My greatest friend, whom I met in the Dukes but from whom I was separated from 1941 until after the War, was Wilson Jackson, who now lives with his wife Bessie, near Bournemouth. Vera was godmother to their son, David, and I am godfather to their daughter, Diana.\nBut I am digressing. As the weather started to improve at the end of March our training took on a more outdoor practical and tactical aspect. We had done some small bore (.22) rifle shooting in the indoor range under the Drill Hall, but the time had come to do with real thing. We took the train to Slaithwaite (pronounced Slowit with the 'ow' as in 'how') and trudged up the steep and rugged path across the peaty Pennine path to Marsden where there was a full scale rifle range. When I looked at the distance between the butts and the targets on the opposite hillside I couldn't imagine how anyone could possible hit the target let alone the bull. I remember my apprehension as I took first pressure on the trigger before giving the final squeeze : how violent would the recoil be? I ought not to have worried, it wasn't all that bad, and my shooting was well up to average. It was a grey, raw day with the wind blowing the tops of the snow remaining on these sodden gritstone moors. More than welcome, therefore, was the hot cup of tea and the sandwich that was laid on for us in the shooting lodge. The most tedious part of the day lay ahead of us with the task of boiling out our rifle barrels, drying them and oiling them in preparation for the rigorous examination they would undergo on the morrow. (The first duty of an infantryman is to check the number on his rifle, he doesn't want to go to the trouble to clean someone else's).\nThen came number of field exercises on one of the local golf courses. Some of these were at night and the results would have been hilarious had one not realised what tragic consequences there had been if it had been the real thing. A sobering thought.\nAbout this time it was decided that the Signals Section ought to be brought up to full strength so likely candidates were chosen from the Rifle companies to train as signallers. Amongst the chosen few were we four Sheffielders, Harry Yates, Pat O'Brien, Gerry Winters and myself. We were therefore transferred to Headquarters Compony who were stationed at Milnsbridge a few miles outside Huddersfield. Here we began to study Morse Code, the operation of field telephones and the art of laying lines across the country. It was very interesting and I enjoyed the work but events overtook us and I never became a signaller.\nThe event that changed the direction of my service in the Dukes was the posting of the Battalion overseas. We were part of the 46th Division (the Oak Tree Division because of our shoulder flashes), and according to Orders this Division was going overseas, not as combatants but to finish its training which had been so badly interrupted by the appalling weather from January to March.\nWe were sent on embarkation leave in mid-April and returned to Milnbridge to complete our preparations for overseas service. The only thing I remember about this was a 3 mile march into Huddersfield to go through the gas chambers (So that we should know what the various poison gases smelt like) and the 3 miles march back all uphill - in full equipment including large pack, rifle and steel helmet and wearing (the last straw) gas masks. A Number of chaps fell out on the way back from sheer exhaustion. I made it all right, but I shall never forget the effort and agony of getting my equipment off at our barracks. All my clothes stuck to my body with perspiration and I was completely dehydrated.\nTwo days before we were due to leave Huddersfield, although at the time we didn't know our date of departure, we marched down to the station, this time more lightly equipped, for entraining exercises. A train was drawn up at the platform and the troops were in ranks facing the train. At a signal from the officer in charge the troops had to board the train as quickly as possible but in good order and array. The O-in-C had a stop watch, and he had us getting in and out of the train until he was satisfied with the time achieved for the manoeuvre. A good plan! But what happened on the day?\nFRANCE 1940\nOn the 27th April 1940 we were told that we would be leaving Huddersfield on the following day. We should be ready to move off at such-and-such a time, but that on no account must we divulge this information to anyone else on the grounds of security. On the 28th April we marched through Huddersfield town centre, with colours flying and the regimental band and drums playing, and with half the population of Huddersfield and Halifax on the pavements cheering and waving us on! When we arrived at the station the platform was crowded with relatives and girl friends of the local boys. Officers, N.C.O.s and other ranks were busy embracing and saying goodbye to their loved ones and the subsequent entraining was a shambles. There was only one consolation, those of us with no one to see us off were able to entrain in comfort, monopolise the luggage space, and settle down in comparative ease with our boots off! So much for forward planning and security measures.\nThat evening we were in Southampton where we boarded a cross-channel ferry and as darkness was falling we steamed out into the Solent to the cheers of the dockers on shore. The night was dark, there was no moon, the sea was running high and a stiff breeze sprang up making it quite cold. I never found a spot where I could be wholly sheltered from the wind and I had a restless and uncomfortable night. I was not sorry, therefore, when dawn broke and I could see in the distance the French coast. Soon afterwards a solitary French aircraft came towards us from the land, circled round us and escorted us into Cherbourg harbour. I was on foreign soil for the first time, and at the expense of H.M. Government. There was no time to look around for almost immediately we had disembarked we were climbing into cattle trucks (10 horses or 40 men) and within minutes we were in our way. I took note of the towns we passed through so I had a rough idea of the direction in which we were travelling. Some of the names were familiar - Bayeux, Caen, Argentan, Le Mans, Nantes and some nineteen hours after leaving Cherbourg we arrived at the little market town of Blain about 20 miles north east of the seaport of St Nazaire. Our camp was about 3 miles from Blain and consisted mainly of Nissen huts. Ablution facilities were almost non existent, and for the first few days we did our washing and shaving from the river bank. After about three days we had improved the ablution and sanitary amenities by our own efforts, after which we settled down to enjoy the surroundings and the daytime weather, which was perfect. The evenings were pleasantly cool and, when not on duty, we would walk into Blain, have a coffee and cake in a bistro - or something stronger if you were inclined that way - and then stroll back to the camp. During the night it became progressively cooler, and we were compelled to add our greatcoats to the blankets that covered us. All through the night the croaking of the bullfrogs in the marshes kept up a constant cacophony. Every morning there was hoar-frost on the grass, and often on our blankets, and we shivered as we crossed to the ablutions - open on all sides to the air - for our wash and shave in cold water. I remember once reading a book where a Sergeant in the Guards said, 'You've never had a real shave until you've shaved in the open air, in cold water and with a blunt razor'. I know what he meant.\nBy mid-morning the sun had driven the mists away and melted the frost, and for the rest of the day it shone out of a blue and cloudless sky. In the afternoon it became unbearably hot and we were glad of the shade of the forest in which we were working, loading trucks with ammunition and petrol. We had been doing this work (our so-called training) for about six weeks when the news came through that on the 10th May the Germans had invaded Holland and Belgium, and so had 'turned' the French Maginot Line defence. Day after day we heard news of the Allied withdrawal towards the Channel ports. On the evening of 18th May we left Blain, once again with band playing and flags flying, to encouraging shouts from French people who we knew were very worried at the situation in the North. We left Blain by rail at 8 o'clock in the evening with rations for one day only, and arrived in Le Mans at half past four on the following morning: the station and sidings were crowded with refugees, including some Belgian soldiers, who were heading South and drew up alongside a British hospital train. We heard afterwards that this was the last train to get away from the fighting area, so we guessed that things were getting desperate. And yet, although we were travelling in very dark, cramped conditions on short rations and with little to drink, and although , when we took our turn at the open door, for fresh air and sanitary functions, we could see for ourselves the chaos that was developing on the roads and railways, in some strange way we felt curiously detached from it all as though we were watching a film. There was no sense of fear (this was confirmed in later conversation with my comrades), only a certain curiosity as to where we were going and how we were to be used. The thought that we might be going into battle never entered into our heads. We were really rookies, less than half trained and, as far as we knew, with little or no ammunition for our rifles, bren guns and our two Boyes anti-tank rifles. As we passed the trains travelling in the opposite direction to us, we received cheers and waves from occupants, civilians and military alike. The cheerful and smiling faces of the soldiers, many of them British, gave us a sense of optimism that everything was all right, although this was balanced to some extent by the appearance and demeanour of the civilians. There was a rumour going round, passed on as we enjoyed the occasional stop where we could stretch our legs, that we were bound for Le Havre, from where, as a non fighting unit, we were to be shipped back to the UK. Hope springs eternal! We found out later that our destination, in fact, was Bethune by way of Amiens, where we were to replace units driven out of their defensive positions by the Germans. However during the night of the 19th/20th we were diverted to Dieppe, as Amiens had been severely bombed and the bridge over the Somme had been blown up (most of the following account has been taken from the 'History of the Duke of Wellingtons Regiment' with my own experiences, in brackets, interposed at the appropriate points).\n'Progress was very slow owing to the movement of the refugees and troops; but, passing through Dieppe, the Dukes arrived at Eu at 1400 hrs. on the 20th May. This town was in process of being evacuated. There were streams of\ncivilians refugees on the roads and many signs of aerial bombardment in the town. The trains moved on in the direction of Abbeville; troop trains containing French and Belgians (many of them waving frantically to us to go back the way we had come: despair and sorrow written on their faces). At one point (actually this happened more than once, on one occasion we ran into a wood for shelter - it was about this time that the reality of the situation hit us, and fear crept in) the Battalion was detained owing to an attack by German Bombers, and on approaching Abbeville we could see a vast column of smoke over the town. The roads were packed with refugees loaded with all their belongings (A few decrepit lorries could be seen, a few horse drawn vehicles, some bicycles, but for the most part the wretched people were on foot, some pushing wheelbarrows) - a pathetic sight, and one wondered whether one would be taking such a detached interest if these events were happening at home. The Dukes were now in the rear train of the Division, when it came to a halt on the outskirts of Abbeville. It was reported that the Germans had occupied the town, and a patrol sent forward located an enemy machine gun post only a short distance away (we heard the rattle of the machine gun as the Germans opened up at the patrol). The staff of the other trains in front had vanished and in consequence a senior warrant officer was put in charge of the engine driver and fireman of the Dukes' train and they were informed that they would not be allowed to leave. They became very excited, but eventually bowed to the inevitable and proved to be a couple of stalwart allies who did magnificent work.\nWe quote the reminiscences of the Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel G Taylor:\nAll the equipment of the unit and much of our transport was on the train and it was impossible to unload as we were halted on an embankment. The 2/6th Dukes were in the train next to ours and it was decided to hitch the two trains together and move back to a more suitable piece of ground which could be seen some 4 miles to the rear, contact had been completely lost with Brigade Headquarters and it could only be assumed that the leading train, in which they were travelling, had been captured.\nIt was now dark and the journey back was not without its excitements. Every few hundred yards, owing to the tremendous strain, a coupling between two trucks would break, and just before we reached our destination the complete floor was pulled out of the mess truck, depositing the staff and equipment on the line (you may guess how we felt in our cattle truck, without light and with no knowledge where we were going. Every time a coupling broke - and we didn't know that this was the cause we would be thrown together into a heap with arms and legs thrashing around in all directions, and one's equipment all over the place. The language had to be heard to be believed!).\nIt was decided to take up positions for all-round defence the 2/6th to the north west and the 2/7th (us) to the south east of the train (This meant sorting out one's webbing, pack etc and finding one's rifle. We didn't bother to look at rifle numbers until first light when we could see which rifle belonged to whom. And so we stood to all night, peering into the darkness towards where we were told the enemy was waiting: we had been issued with 10 rounds of ammunition per man. To our rear we could hear the crash of explosions and bursts of machine gun fire).\nWe were in touch with no other formation, had no supply line, not even a map of the area, until a batman from his kit produced a Bradshaw's Railway Guide of Central Europe, which was of the greatest assistance.\nAs dawn broke many armoured fighting vehicles could be seen patrolling the roads, and air activity developed as the morning wore on. We found later that at this time we were the only Allied troops between Abbeville and Dieppe which was some 60 kilometres to the S.W. Early in the morning the two Dukes units were joined by the 271st Field Coy., Royal Engineers under Major King. The pioneers, by breaking up trucks, constructed ramps by which they cleverly unloaded two utility vehicles. In one of these Capt. Gerrard and the French Liaison Officer, M Stelebourn, left for Eu to contact higher authority, and Lieut K Smith (our Intelligence Officer) and 2nd Lieut G W Smith of the 2/6th left in the other to reconnoitre Abbeville. Unfortunately the latter party ran into a machine gun position occupied by the Germans on the outskirts of Abbeville; Lieut K Smith was killed (our first casualty) and the others in the vehicle had very narrow escapes (This news filtered through to us as we waited for action and it did little to reassure us).\nDuring the afternoon enemy air activity increased, and as the railway line to the south was completely blocked it was decided to withdraw to some wooded country which could be seen some 3 miles to the rear (What we were eating and drinking all this time I quite forget, but it can't have been very much. I do remember an issue of 2 cigarettes per man, as we lay in a fold of ground on the edge of a cornfield in the sweltering sun. Just my luck, I didn't smoke! Now had it been a bar of chocolate).\nDaylight the following day showed that several trains in the vicinity of Fressenville had been mercilessly attacked from the air by bombs, cannon and machine gun fire. Some trains were civilian, others French military and one was a French hospital train.\nThe civilian trains had been evacuated in a hurry. Food and wine were still on the table (I wonder where it went to?), luggage was piled up on the racks and a few passengers had been killed. One of the trains contained all the horses of a French cavalry unit, but no troops. From that time the Bandmaster, who was acting as a medical sergeant, used a fine grey mare to carry himself and his medical pannier. The hospital train was filled with French wounded and we promised to do all we could to evacuate them. Behind this train two others were telescoped, and thrown into the tender of one was one dead man still holding his dog by the lead. The dog was jealousy guarding the body of its dead master. Later it decided to adopt the Battalion and remained with us until the end of operations (when we came upon the sight of these terribly damaged trains we saw for the first time the horrors of war: one cattle truck, filled with people, had been telescoped to a total length of not more than 10 feet, and the sight of the mangled bodies, compressed in so a short a space was horrific. Hanging upside down on the front of one of the locomotives, blown there, we surmised, by an explosion, was the body of a young woman, with only her vest on. Her clothes must have been stripped from her by the blast. As I walked the length of the trains to give a hand where I could, I noticed something in the long grass at the side of the track. When I went over to investigate I discovered the bodies of a little boy and a little girl, both, I would imagine, three to four years old. They were lying together, face upwards, and at first I thought they were sleeping. There was not a mark on either of them, their cheeks were still shining and rosy red, but there was a waxen sheen to them which gave them the look of two beautiful dolls. I could only assume they, too, had been killed by the blast. The sight of these two innocents upset me more than all the other horrific things I saw that day)\nThe Battalion took up a defensive position in the woods. The day was very hot and the supply of water was beginning to cause anxiety. A reconnoitring party was sent out to find a supply and at the station of Chepy-les-Valenes met a railway engineer and informed him of the plight of the hospital train. He said that a breakdown train was in the vicinity and if we would give him protection and help he would try and extricate the hospital train.\nThe whole Battalion volunteered for the task and a company stood by the train with their anti-aircraft guns. The railway engineers and the Dukes worked frantically, and with a huge crane and ropes pulled up and relaid the permanent way. This work was interrupted throughout by attacks from enemy bombers.\nWhile the work was goin on Capt. Gerrard returned. He had contacted a British Headquarters, which was quite 'excited' to hear of a complete and fully equipped battalion (my inverted commas), and although they could not credit the fact that we were so near the Somme, they sent orders for us to retire to Dieppe as quickly as possible and take up a defensive position along the River Bethune. I (Lt Col Taylor) decided to extricate the hospital train and then withdraw by night marches to Dieppe, a distance of 50 miles (in fact our contingent actually started to walk to Dieppe: luckily as you will see, we finished by train).\nVery little food had been available for the past three days, so a truck was sent to St Valery-sur-Somme. The railway engineers told us that a hospital there had been evacuated. The truck returned in a short time laden with invalid jelly, chicken breasts in aspic, and other delicacies not usually on the ration - they were all very welcome (my memory fails me at this point: or was it that only the higher ranks were the beneficiaries of this windfall?).\nThe day was sweltering (I do remember that!), but such wonderful work had been put into clearing of the line that it was evident that the hospital train would be pulled out that night. It was a tremendous thrill to everyone when the engine was hitched on and the train began to move slowly over the repaired tracks.\nThe engineer was delighted and he handed round the few bottles of French beer he had in his van - never did beer taste so good (to whom?). Over the beer he expressed his gratitude for our help and offered to save us our long trek to Dieppe if we could get into a small number of cattle trucks which were in the station.\nWe made the grade, packed like herrings; few trains have been driven so frantically. On two occasions men fell out going round corners, and at one point the floor of a truck was pulled completely out. The driver of the train was running no risk of being overtaken by the Germans: he drove as if he was on the footplate of the 'Flying Scotsman'.\nThe Battalion arrived at Dieppe at 0730 hours on the morning of 27th May. Many of the men had not slept for three days and rations had been very meagre, inspite of the windfall from the evacuated hospital at St Valery sur Somme (We were very dirty, very sleepy and extremely hungry when we arrived in Dieppe and marched, in good order, across the square and up the road that wound uphill from the town to the hill overlooking Dieppe. We had no transport so the heavy cases of Bren ammunition were shared out amongst us, to take turns in carrying them to our destination - where this was, and how far away we didn't know. As luck had it my turn came on the steepest part of the hill and I was glad when |I was eventually relieved of my burden. I felt I couldn't have carried it another yard).\n(The Dukes were accommodated in the prisoners-of-war cage on the hill behind the town very conspicuous from the sea and the air, and an easy target for bombs and machine gun attacks - we always felt very exposed and vulnerable. In fact the first thing we did was to dig slit trenches around the Nissen huts in which we were housed for refuge when air attacks came - which they did!). Area Headquarters, which was situated in a medieval castle at Les Turelles, was very glad to welcome the Battalion, as the only other troops they had to form a defensive screen consisted of a small number of men who had been working on lines of communication, and a few military policemen.\nEverybody was delighted to find major Jock Huffam V.C., acting as Provost Marshal of Dieppe, and his confidence and cheerfulness kept everybody in good heart.\nIt was decided that a reconnaissance of the area should take place on the day we arrived, and as a result of this the Battalion took over the line Dieppe - Arques - la Bataille the following morning.\nAt noon that day air-raid siren sounded and the Dukes experienced their first taste of dive-bombing, which was to become an unpleasant and daily occurrence during the remainder of the operations (The Germans had started to use 'screaming' bombs, and the sound of them coming down - giving the impression that they were coming straight at you - was more frightening than the eventual explosion. We had a sergeant, to name him would be invidious, who went to pieces when we crouched in our slit trenches and he never became accustomed to the effect of these bombs. Later, when he faced the onslaught of German infantry and tanks he was bravery personified. We had to face the ordeal of being dive-bombed several times a day for over a fortnight. Luckily we had no physical casualties though one young chap from Hull was sent south to Le Havre for hospitalisation and shipping back to the UK. We never heard whether he recovered from his 'shell shock', or indeed whether he reach Le Havre. The only time there was anything approaching panic was one evening when most of the camp was in the Canteen Hut. There was very little to buy at the counter, but it was a convenient place for a game of cards or a chat with friends who were not your hut mates. Suddenly, without any of the usually 'screaming' warning, there was the 'crump' of bombs falling in rapid succession, the hut shook violently and we thought the next bomb must surely demolish the hut and all of us who were in it. There was a mad dash for the only door, and there would certainly have been some casualties in the general melee had it not been for the stentorian voice of the Provost Sergeant, Sgt E Lees MM, a diminutive veteran of the 1914/1918 War, exhorting us - and calming us - with his 'Steady, lads, steady!'. The effect was electric, we stopped in our tracks. But it was all over; the planes had departed leaving only a number of large craters on the perimeter of the camp. We had, had a narrow escape).\nOn this first occasion - on our first day in Dieppe - the target was the shipping in the harbour: the bombing was very accurate and five ships, including a hospital was sunk. During this raid a batman asked his officer is he should get him a brandy, and when asked why, replied, 'I think it would do us both good, sir'.\nThe 2/7th were now part of the 'Beauman Force' which had its headquarters at Rouen and consisted of all British regiments that had not been caught in the Dunkirk pocket. The Dukes held a line from the coast along the River Bethune, joining up with the 2/4th King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry who were in Arques-la-Bataille area; they in turn joined up with 2/6th Dukes.\nThe 2/7th spent the next few days in constructing strong points, making road-blocks and generally strengthening the defensive position. Enemy air-raids increased in intensity and reports were receive of the presence of enemy mechanised and motorised forces in the vicinity of Abbeville and St Valery sur Some.\nThe 51st (Highland) Division, which had been in the Saar and had therefore escaped the Dunkirk pincer movement were moved over the Somme and with the assistance of the 7th Border Regiment staged a gallant but unsuccessful counter-attack. The Division then withdrew to the line of the River Bresle.\nFollowing a reconnaissance by Capt. Gerrard on 29th May a party of Dukes was sent out the following day to salvage the Battalion train abandoned four days earlier. The men found that the train had been ransacked and all the officers' valises had been taken. It appeared that the enemy was not responsible; but most of the valuable stores had been looted, although the drums and band instruments were recovered, together with our packs and greatcoats. (I lost various items from my pack, including the First War steel mirror that had been my fathers').\nThe River Bethune was now the reserve line and the Dukes did their utmost to restore the morale of the civilian population, which had naturally been affected by the constant bombing and low-flying machine-gun attacks, and the reports of large German forces in the vicinity. On two occasions the band and drums beat retreat in the square in Dieppe and created tremendous enthusiasm amongst the French population.\nThe strength of the defence of the road blocks was increased by every possible means, anti-tank mines were laid on the coast road to Le Treport and Eu, and patrols were constantly sent out throughout the day and night. During one of these Lieut. T Birkhead was killed in an enemy attack.\nThe storm was gathering; the last elements were now leaving Dunkirk and soon the Germans, flushed with victory, would be rushing south to complete the kill. (I can truthfully say that I was the first man in the Battalion, perhaps in the whole of Dieppe/Le Havre sector to know about the Dunkirk evacuation and the scale of the operation. A small fleet of French coastal vessels had sailed into Dieppe waters from the north during the night. As dawn broke the leading ship started sending Morse messages by signal lamp to shore. Whom they were signalling to we never found out: fifth column activities were suspected at the time. Our duty signallers decided to take down the message, but, apart from a plethora of numbers the rest of the very long message was in French which they were not able to understand. Knowing from our stay in Blain (seemingly light years ago) that I could speak French they brought the message for me to translate before submitting it to the Officer on duty, who presumably passed it on to the Colonel. I don't know if this was the cause, but a few days later I was transferred from Signals to the Intelligence Section. The receipt of the message filled us with foreboding because we knew now that we were encircled. Le Havre had been taken to the south of us, and Dunkirk to the north).\nAt this time Battalion Headquarters was at Chateau Janvil, where a flying squad was always in readiness to investigate fifth-column reports. On 5th June aerial activity by the enemy was nearly non-stop and reports concerning the dropping of parachute troops arrived almost hourly. (That evening I was a member of a patrol through the streets of Dieppe and by the docks investigating reports from civilians that there was fifth-column activity in the town and that the church bell had been mysteriously rung just before an air-raid. We found nothing untoward, our only action was the repeated dropping to the ground when enemy aircraft flew over. For some reason I had been given a German Mauser pistol that evening and my only excitement and worry was deciding whether the safety catch was on or off. I could never remember the position so I was constantly taking off the magazine and pressing the trigger to see if it operated!)\nThe result of all these patrols was the capture of one German parachutist who was shot while descending but not seriously wounded.\nNo infantry or tank attack had so far tested the defence along the River Bethune. Intelligence reports arriving stated that the enemy was being held along the line of the Somme; these defence were still holding out two days later. (They were not to hold out much longer, however. The day after the last news reached us, Gerry Winters and I were sent out to establish an observation post on the high ground overlooking the coastal plain to the North-east of Dieppe. From here we had a good view of the sea and the sparsely wooded plain. Before we reached the high ground, however, we had to cross the main Dieppe to Le Treport road from a small copse shielded from the road by a high bank. As we climbed the bank we heard the sound of horses' hooves approaching at the gallop. Concealed behind a tree we awaited the arrival of what? An enemy cavalry patrol? (Our imaginations were working overtime and our hearts beat faster in time with the galloping hooves as over the brow of the hill and down the road towards us came a solitary white, riderless horse). When we reached the ridge we could see in the distance puffs of smoke and faint sounds of gunfire, but were too far away to see any action on the ground. Then we suddenly became aware that, about 300 yards to our left, across a ploughed field, was a battery of Royal Artillery. We began to walk across the field towards the battery when a voice hailed us from that direction, 'What the blankety blank do you thin you are doing? If you've got to come over here then get down and crawl'. When we reached the battery position (well camouflaged with netting and greenery) the commander tore us off a strip for endangering his position, but was able to give us information of enemy activity to the north which we were able to take back to Battalion. We had completed our first intelligence mission).\nOn the 7th June Lieut. Colonel Taylor assumed command of the Dieppe defence, and the same afternoon the Commander of the 152nd British Infantry Brigade visited the Dukes' Headquarters and stated that he was occupying a defensive position along the River Bethune on the right of the Battalion line.\nOn taking over, Lieut. Colonel Taylor decided to withdraw his forward companies to the west of the docks and the river, as these were the obvious anti-tank obstacles. By doing this his front was also decreased in length, and he took up a position with three companies forward: Z (my old company) on the right, W in the centre, and X on the left guarding the docks crossing. He arranged with the Sappers that demolition of the river and docks crossings should be in readiness should the situation demand drastic measures. Y Coy was in close support in the Chateau Rosendal woods, and HQ Coy (of which Intelligence section was a part) furnished mobile platoons which were being constantly sent off to round up parachutists. The aerodrome at Dieppe was rendered unserviceable by ploughing and the Army stores there were destroyed (I was one of the party of three sent to destroy these stores. When we entered the hangar containing the stores we were angered and disgusted. For a fortnight we had been living on minimal rations and hard biscuits and, those who smoked, on a very small ration of cigarettes; chocolates and sweets were non-existent as far as the rank and file were concerned. But here in the stores were literally thousands of loaves of bread, some now with mould on them, and boxes of chocolate, cigarettes, jam and many other kinds of provisions that would have lifted our morale and satisfied our perpetual hunger. And we were to destroy it all. We filled our battle-dress pockets with as much chocolate and as many cigarettes as we could, before dousing the place in petrol, setting a petrol trail, throwing a match in and watching the place thoroughly alight before reporting back to the unit. At least we had something to share with our comrades).\nThe Commanding Officer's narrative continues:\n'On 9th June we received orders that we were to become part of the 51st Highland Division under General Victor Fortune, and that the Division should withdraw through us, after which the bridge over the Bethune at Dieppe would be blown. Subsequently we should be relieved by the 2nd Seaforths, and the Dukes Battalion and the 4th Seaforths would act as rear guard to the Division on the withdrawal towards Le Havre.\nSevere fighting was in progress on the right flank, held by the 152nd British Infantry Brigade, on the night of 9th/10th June. Early the following morning information was received that the bridges over the Somme had been blown. Refugees passing through the Dukes' lines reported the presence of enemy armoured fighting vehicles in the vicinity of Neuville and at 1500 hrs German patrols began to test the Battalion line; these were assisted by mortar fire. The enemy displayed great daring and also lack of knowledge of the methods of taking cover and, as a result, suffered heavy casualties.\nMeanwhile the 51st Division had passed through and the bridge over the Bethune was blown. Later a small fox terrier was seen on the other side, much distressed as it could not get home. (By this time we had evacuated the hospital camp on the top of the hill, and were temporarily given shelter in a large, empty hospital to await the withdrawal from Dieppe. We had just settled down to sleep for an hour or so when there came the biggest explosion I had ever heard. Not having been told of the impending blowing of the Bethune bridge we wondered, fearfully, if we were targets for a heavy artillery attack as glass showered on us from the shattered windows and plaster fell from the ceilings. We were relieved when there were no further explosions).\nAt midnight on 10th/11th June (shortly after our explosion scare) the withdrawal to motor transport at Petit Appeville took place without incident. To lessen the prospect of enemy interference the escape route followed second and third class roads; the truck drivers had been taken over the route twice to make sure that knew the way, and as an extra precaution guides were placed at each turning. This preparation paid a good dividend. As rear guard (luckily a fact unknown to us) we were the last battalion to leave Dieppe, but were the first to arrive, at dawn on the 11th June, as a complete unit, at Veules-les-Roses (a pretty little seaside village, with rose covered cottages - a favourite haunt of painters in happier days). The drivers and guides had done a grand job.\n(I remember that journey most vividly. We were packed so tightly that no none could sit. I did my best to perch on the edge of the truck, but the canvas top was stretched so tightly across it that the many bumps and jolts, and the sudden stops and starts would have made it difficult in any case. We had been told to show no lights at all, but two N.C.O's who ought to have shown a better example, persisted in lighting up cigarettes, thus displaying lights, and at the same time polluting the already malodorous atmosphere within the truck. It was a most uncomfortable journey and it was a relief when we arrived at our destination, even if our first action was to run for cover as a wave of enemy bombers flew over - to bomb, as we discovered later, the 51st Highland Division who had reached St Valery-en-Caux where that were completely surrounded. I spoke to our driver who told me that several times during our journey we had passed the ends of roads in which enemy tanks were lying in wait. That they had let us pass could mean only one thing, they were sure we could all be rounded up in the closed-off sector we were approaching!) On arrival at Veules-les-Roses orders were received from the Commander of 152nd Inf. Bde for the Dukes to take up a defensive position from the road Blosseville-Bourg-Dun to the sea at Veule-les-Roses. Whilst carrying out a reconnaissance with his company commanders at 0530 hours the Commanding Officer saw a British destroyer lying about 2 miles offshore signalling with lamps. A mental note was made of this fact. Before going into position the Dukes were informed that French Alpine troops had taken up positions from Veules-les-Roses to the sea, thus shortening the Battalion front. The 4th Seaforths were on the right of the Dukes.\nThe roads were now packed with the remnants of the traffic from the 51st Division and many French units. The enemy had reached Yvetot, some 20 miles to the south, and, pushing north towards us, was driving all Allied troops through the defensive position. (At this time we rank and file were only aware of the coming attack from the north!). A heavy air raid on Veules-les-Roses at noon, in which incendiary and high-explosive bombs were dropped, added to the general confusion. The day was extremely hot; the village, well named, looked very beautiful, with most of the houses covered with rambler roses in full bloom.\n(Battalion Headquarters were situated in an orchard some 300 yards from the village. From here members of the Intelligence section were sent out in pairs - on a shift rota - to help with controlling the heavy traffic at the cross roads to the north of Veules-les-Roses and also to report any suspicious activity and identities to Headquarters. When my companion and I reached the cross-roads it was the scene of indescribable chaos and confusion. Troops, mostly French, were arriving in droves, some on bicycles, some on motor-bikes-, lorries and trucks, while the majority were on foot, weary, bedraggled and spiritless. We were suspicious of the motorcyclists because there had been reports of German troops disguised in French uniform, but a French liaison officer who was with us vouched for their authenticity. (Unless he, too, was a fifth-columnist). Whilst we were on duty at the cross roads, we experienced the heavy air-raid mentioned above by the C.O. Luckily there was a makeshift hospital some 50 yards away in some wine cellars, and we were able to dash to comparative safety as the bombs rained down.\nIn the late afternoon we were told to evacuate the orchard and take up positions in a nearby sunken road to await the arrival of the enemy). The CO's account continues -\nA Brigade conference was called for 1630 hrs. The strain of operations was now beginning to tell on everyone. During the conference half a dozen German tanks passed by, only two fields away. We were informed that our perimeter was surrounded and that it was the intention of the Navy to evacuate the Division from St Valery. Motor vehicles were to be destroyed, together with surplus stores. The 152nd Brigade would be withdrawn from the line immediately, and the Dukes, who were to remain in position till dusk, would - during that time come under the orders of the 513rd Inf. Bde.\nOwing to enemy movement it was difficult to get back to Battalion Headquarters (the orchard). I arrived back to find the battle in full swing, with one company already being pushed back, but a very gallant counter-attack by the reserve company soon restored the situation.\nThe Battalion dispositions were, right Y Coy, centre W Coy, left z Coy, with X Coy in support near Battalion Headquarters in the sunken road in Veules-les-Roses. The enemy firepower consisted mainly of mortars, heavy machine guns and light artillery. A very large amount of tracer bullets were used, and these must have reduced the number of casualties, as the 'hose-pipes' of it could be seen, and could be avoided.\nEnemy low-flying planes were constantly overhead and they dropped collections of small bombs with a delayed action which produced an effect like Chinese crackers. The tracer bullets had set nearly everything on fire, houses, barns, haystacks, so that one began to realise what was meant by the fog of war, the smoke from the fires combining with the dust thrown up by the bombs and mortar shells. Some 35 to 45 tanks were now attacking the Battalion front. The Dukes had no artillery or machine gun support, though they had been lent two 20mm anti-tank guns. Each gun fired one shot, after which that were put out of action by the German tanks. About 1700 hrs Z Coy reported that they were being heavily engaged by enemy infantry, and shortly after, following a mortar bombardment, a large number of light and medium tanks made an assault on the Duke's front. During this attack air activity and long range machine gun fire increased in the vicinity of Battalion Headquarters, making communication with the companies impossible.\nThe forward companies dealt heroically with the tank attack and the enemy withdrew, leaving five or six tanks which had been put out of action.\nFollowing a lull of about an hour a violent artillery bombardment of the whole area heralded a mass attack of some 200 armoured fighting vehicles. After heroic resistance these pierced the Battalions lines and drove on in the direction of Battalion Headquarters. The Dukes suffered sever casualties during this action, but their pluck and determination won the respect of the enemy. A German officer told a platoon commander whose position had been overrun 'You are a very brave regiment'. The armoured cars did not reach Battalion Headquarters because of road blocks, and the vehicles swung left onwards St Valery-en-Caux along the main road south-west within the bridge.\nIn accordance with the orders he had received the Commanding Officer issued instructions that companies were to escape to the beach at St Valery as soon as darkness fell. He realised that the harbour there might now be occupied by the enemy, and the presence of a British destroyer off the beach at Veules-les-Roses was a comforting thought. As a last desperate measure it might be necessary to try and contact it.\nAs Battalion Headquarters were packing up, tanks were seen approaching the sunken road where the Headquarters were situated: the Headquarters evaporated quickly!\nThe Companies found great difficulty in negotiating the streets of Veules owing to the heavy shelling and the fact that most buildings were on fire. The officers collected the men in small parties and these withdrew independently to the beach. Dawn broke with a heavy mist over the sea, but in spite of this boats came ashore from many vessels off the coast and evacuations commenced.\nEnemy aircraft did their best to interfere but they were driven off by fire from the ships. As the mist lifted enemy artillery opened fire on the beaches, but the Navy silenced these before any serious casualties occurred.\nAs the morning wore on the beaches were raked by machine gun fore, causing many casualties; but the majority of the troops got away. Many of the Battalion were wounded during this period and those most badly hit spent the next three or four years in captivity. Amongst these was L/Cpl. Dickinson who had some interesting souvenirs of the beach at Veules-les-Roses. He had been wounded in the arm and the chest and was lying on the beach when he received a sever 'kick in the pants'. In the hip pocket of his battle-dress he had about a dozen copper coins, French and English. A bullet hit the middle of them, bent most of them into fantastic shapes and even imprinted the inscription of one of the French coins on an English penny. Dickinson received only a slight flesh wound from this bullet.\n(Apart from a few exceptions Colonel Taylor's description of events affecting Headquarters Coy. tallies very closely with my own experience. He could not have known the details of course, of every personal experience. I will, therefore, supply my own -\nLate in the afternoon of 11th June we were called together, told of the seriousness of the situation, and told that we were to leave our exposed position in the orchard for the cover of a nearby sunken road. As we crossed the open field between the orchard and the sunken road we were the object of machine gun fire and we threw ourselves on the ground in automatic self defence. We were then on the scrub covered slope over the top of which we were to drop down into the sunken road. We were soon aware that the slope afforded us no protection from the enemy's fire because this was coming from the village behind us, so our entry into the sunken road was precipitate to say the least. Unfortunately on hitting the ground prior to this last rush forward my trouser knee was fouled by a patch of human excreta, with results that can be imagined. It was a battle scar I carried for many days.\nWe had not been in our new position for many minutes before intense enemy activity began, and we were soon in the thick of mortar bombs, artillery shells and heavy machine gun fire. Most of this went over our heads, and we were sheltered from the worst effect by the high walls of our sunken road. Nevertheless several bombs and shells fell into our position, and there were a number of casualties. Enemy low flying aircraft were constantly overhead: at first we thought that they were not attacking our positions, but several seconds after they had passed over their delayed bombs exploded with a sound like very loud Chinese crackers, shooting fragments of metal in all directions: some of these were like slim, nickel plated, bullets. These 'firework' bombs did little material damage nor, as far as I knew, any casualties to our troops, but they added a new, psychological dimension to the conflict. The effect of the attack on Battalion Headquarters by mortars, artillery, machine guns and aircraft pinned down H.Q. Staff to their positions and prevented communications with forward companies. The result was a certain deterioration of morale: it is not easy to be passive objects of aggression and remain calm and brave. If we could hit back it would have relieved much of the tension. As it was the most many of us could do was to keep our heads down, overlapping steel helmets, and to pray that none of the lethal projectiles had our names on them. Home was geographically far away, but very near to our hearts as we rode out of the storm. As darkness fell the Padre called us together during a lull in the noise of battle and told us that we had been instructed to withdraw to the beach at Veules-les-Roses, and put us in the capable hands of L/Cpl. Bill Gamble and L/Cpl Draper to lead us there. These N.C.O.s were regular soldiers who had seen service in India and the Middle East, and they were both Sheffielders.\nThe badly wounded were made as comfortable as possible, and left behind, with the Padre, to their fates in prisoner of war camps: the walking wounded came with us and most of them, like us, reached freedom.\nL/Cpls Gamble and Draper had already, under enemy fire and avoiding enemy patrol, reconnoitred the village and beach area, and, in the darkness, had found a way down the cliffs to the beach. There was no other route to this than through the village itself. When we came to the edge of the village we found that most of its buildings were on fire, the flames lighting up the square and its off shoot streets with daylight clarity. The problem was to cross the square without being seen by the enemy: we did this successfully, one by one at irregular intervals - with our hearts in our mouths. Luck was on our side that night, we must inadvertently have chosen a time when the enemy patrols were busy elsewhere, otherwise we should have had little chance of escape.\nIt was with a great sense of relief that we re-grouped on the sea-ward side of Veules but this was tinged with some apprehension of what we might find on the beaches. The night was dark, and seemed more so after the light of the blazing village, as we gingerly made our way down the steep and narrow path leading, we hoped, to the beach. Soon we felt the scrunch of sand under our feet, and we knew we had made it! A mile or so to the south we could see the flames rising into the sky over the town of St Valery-en-Caux, from which came the sound of artillery and aerial bombardment. (We were to learn later that the bulk of the 51st Highland Division were trapped there: many were killed, but many more wounded and/or taken prisoner). Our first problem was how to spend 6 or 7 hours before dawn. Though the day had been hot the night was now cool, with a cold breeze blowing from the sea. We huddled as closely as possible to the foot of the cliffs where there was sufficient sand for us to hollow out to make shallow depressions to lie in. We were much too tense - and hungry - however to sleep and we spent the night talking and straining our eyes for signs of life out there on the dark sea. We were joined by members of a French unit, and I spoke for some time with one of them who had been a waiter in a London hotel. I shared amongst these Frenchmen the last packet of cigarettes I had 'salvaged' from the Stores I had helped to destroy. From time to time during the night we were joined by small parties of men from our rifle companies, from whom we heard the harrowing details of their encounters with German infantry and tanks, and the equally appalling experiences in trying to find a way down the high cliffs after the enemy had passed through their lines. A number of the men had been killed trying to reach the beach by fastening rifle slings together, but these had come apart sending men hurtling to their deaths on the rocks below, or, because in the darkness the height of the cliffs had been under-estimated, with similar results.\nAfter what seemed an eternity we detected a pale light in the eastern sky, and a small party of us walked down to the water's edge, partly to stretch our legs and get our circulation going, and partly to see if there were any signs that help might be coming from the sea. Very soon the light was good enough for us to see that there were a number of vessels standing off shore, and to distinguish the shapes of destroyers from other types of shipping. Two medium sized steamers were particularly noticeable: we found out later that these were the L.M.S. steamer the 'Duke of York' and the 'Princess Maud' (ex Belfast - Heysham ferry), which carried our contingent back to Southampton.\nIt was not yet fully light when my good friend, Dougie Dart, decided to swim to the nearest ship - more than half a mile away - to see if the flotilla was British and, if so, to let it know that there were men on the beach - British and French - who would soon be in enemy hands if they were not rescued. If the vessels had been German, Dougie Dart would have been captured immediately, and we would have been prisoners in a very short time. Dougie stripped down to his underpants, left his other clothes and equipment with me, dived into the sea and struck out strongly for the ships. It seemed an age before we saw him again, swimming powerfully towards us. With teeth chattering in the cold air of dawn he pulled on his clothes and equipment, and went off to find an officer to give him the good news. Some months later, when the London Gazzette published a list of awards for gallantry in the St Valerie operation, I was disappointed that Dougie Dart was not in the list of men so honoured.\nAs soon as it was fully light we could see small boats approaching shore, but our jubilation soon turned to disappointment when a heavy mist came down, and the operation had to be postponed.\nAfter a time the mist began to clear and the little boats were seen to be coming inshore: at this point enemy artillery began to bombard the beaches, and we all rushed back to gain the shelter of the cliffs and the huge rocks at their base. The enemy artillery were soon silenced by the guns of the distant destroyers. It was fascinating to witness the effects of the difference in speed of light and sound. First we saw the muzzle flash of the Navy's guns, then the express-train sound of the shells flying overhead and the explosion of the shells on the cliff-tops, and finally the sound of the naval guns firing the shells whose flight and impact we had already heard! When there was no resumption of enemy firing we prepared to be taken off. The tide had reached the seaward end of the solitary jetty so, in typical British fashion we formed an orderly queue on the jetty and the beach, restraining the Frenchmen who would have jumped the queue, but allowing them to retain their rightful positions in it. The first boatload had been taken aboard when the first wave of enemy aircraft roared over the beach spraying it with machine-gun fire and causing a number of casualties. At each attack the troops broke queue and raced for cover, but immediately reformed the queue on the jetty as if they were waiting for the next 'bus at home! This happened a number of times, and by the time my pals and I had reached the front of the queue we saw, to our dismay, that the tide had come in so far that the boats for which we were waiting were several yards behind us. We hadn't waited so long and so patiently, only to be cheated out of our turn by the tide, so we jumped into the sea, into six feet of water, fully dressed and with all our equipment. I managed to stay with my head above water long enough for a burly Canadian sailor to grab me by the back of my pants and haul me over the gunwale to land floundering on the bottom of the boat, completely waterlogged, with great loss of dignity but with an overwhelming sense of gratitude and relief. As I stood on the deck of the Princess Maud, dripping great pools of water, I was able to look round at the amazing scene. There seemed to be boats and ships everywhere milling around in feverish activity whilst the Navy destroyers stood a short way off like mother ducks watching over their broods. Suddenly we could hear machine gun and small arms fire sweeping the beach, and we could only guess at the number of casualties occurring there. Almost immediately after we saw the flash from artillery on the cliff tops, and suddenly the sea around us was erupting with exploding shells as the German gunners were finding their range. We were immediately ordered below decks,where we were very much more afraid than had we stayed on deck. We had been below for a few minutes, listening to the noise of exploding shells, when we heard and feel a tremendous impact. We've been hit!, we shouted, and rushed for the companion way. We had, indeed, been hit, just on the water line, but providentially the shell had not exploded and it was relatively easy to plug the hole with mattresses and make it fairly watertight with tarpaulins. As a result of this occurrence the Captain of the 'Princess Maud' requested permission to put out to sea without escort and to proceed, alone, to Southampton. During this long journey we stood to on deck with our rifles in case we were pursued by and suffered the attacks of enemy aircraft. I shudder to think what would have happened had we been attacked: as luck would have it the enemy was engaged elsewhere. (We heard later, mostly from Battalion comrades who had experienced it, that we were the lucky ones, sailing as we did direct to England. Most of the other ships and boats had predominantly French troops aboard so sailed south to Cherbourg and other French ports to discharge these troops. It was many days before the British troops embarked again for their journey home).\nRETURN FROM FRANCE 1940\nSouthampton, with its massive air cover of barrage balloons, was the most beautiful and welcome scene of my life. I know now how the pope feels when he kneels to kiss the soil of a country he is visiting. I could have done the same. It was like awakening from a long and terrifying nightmare to find oneself safe in one's bed (Incidentally a few days after reaching UK our mail caught us up - after three weeks without any - and amongst it was a letter from Vera saying that on the night of 11th/12th June she dreamt that she had received a telegram saying that I was coming home. It was 12th June when we were evacuated from the beach at Veules-le-Roses. Coincidence, telepathy, or the constant wishing for something to come true. Who knows?)\nWe must have been a sorry sight as we trooped down the gangplank at Southampton; dirty, unshaven, red-eyed from lack of sleep (2 hours in 3 days), our uniforms crumpled and creased from rough wear and total immersion in the sea. There was a train waiting for us in Southampton station, and when we had boarded it members of the W.V.S. came round with paper cups of tea (more than welcome), sandwiches, an apple and a piece of cake. Despite not having eaten anything but a couple of squares of chocolate for 48 hours I had no appetite and could only manage to eat the apple.\nIn a very short time we arrived in Winchester, and were taken by 'bus to the camp of the Kings' Royal Rifle Corp which was a few miles out of town. There we were allocated tents, had the luxury of a hot shower and a much needed shave, and were given a meal, much of which I was then able to eat. I remember that I slept very soundly that night, but was awakened quite early by the sound of aeroplanes flying over the camp. These were ours, but in my half-sleeping, half-waking state I was momentarily filled with panic and I thought I was still in France with German planes coming to bombard us. This turning over of the stomach at the sound of aircraft lasted for many weeks. We were in Winchester for three days, but we had no duties apart from muster parades morning and evening. I was thus able to see something of this historic town with its Saxon associations, its statue of Alfred the Great, and its magnificent Norman cathedral. My first port of call was the cathedral, because of a family connection. Uncle Tom, who was killed in the Great War, was called up to the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1914 and spent his first night sleeping in the open cathedral yard. I guessed that the cathedral would hold the regiment's Book of Honour and Remembrance, and so it did. I looked for a verger, and asked him if it was possible to see my uncle's entry in the book. There it was C.S.M. Straw, Thos. Hy (D.C.M.) and mentioned in despatches 1917. The verger, seeing the evident pride in my face, said he would leave the book open at that page for the rest of the day. Apart from some excellent canteens and tea shops, the only other things I specifically remember are Winchester College - in which I was interested because its motto 'Manners makyth man' had been adopted by my old Council School, and the lovely 18th Century mill close to the town centre through which the River Itchen rushes before winding through beautiful gardens alongside the city's medieval walls.\nWe had only been in Winchester for 3 days when the order came to move - again to an unknown destination. The troop train taking us followed a tortuous route as if it was bent on shaking off hostile pursuers. We first travelled west, then north west followed by north east, then finally northwards, at which time we were filled with hopes that our destination was somewhere in the vicinity of Sheffield. Sure enough, we eventually steamed into Sheffield Victoria, but we were to stay there for only ten minutes. In this time I rushed to the station bookstall, bought a postcard of Sheffield High Street, trams and all, with the buildings that were later destroyed in the Sheffield 'blitz'. I wrote a short pencilled, note to Vera, and gave it to a civilian, who refused payment for the stamp asking him to post it. I still have that postcard, Vera having saved nearly all of the letter and card I sent her during my 6 years of service.\nOur eventual destination was Belle Vue Manchester, where we were billeted in the ballroom and did our drill in the vicinity of the zoo area where I am sure we were as much objects of curiosity to the animals as they were to us. Later in the War special precautions were taken to ensure that animals were not a source of danger to civilians in the event of air raids, but at this time the zoo was still organised on peace time lines.\nIt was possible at this time to obtain sleeping out passes, and I lost no time in applying for, and obtaining one. I conveniently forgot to say that I would not be using this in Manchester - which was the object of the concession. After the last parade of the day, therefore - at 1600 hours - I left Belle Vue to catch the train to Sheffield, arriving there about half past six, spending the evening with Vera, and, after a couple of hours sleep, catching the tram to the Victoria Station where I caught the train back to Manchester. I used to fall on my bed in Belle Vue, fully dressed, for about an hour before the bugle sounded Reveille. I did this for about 10 days before I had to call a halt and have a full night's sleep in bed. Eventually we were transferred to the vacant tram shed at Ardwick Green, where, to be ready to cope with enemy parachutists! We had to stand-to at dusk and dawn. And so 'Goodbye sleeping out passes', legitimate or otherwise (A few weeks later, now in civilian billets in Burnley, we heard the news that the tram depot at Ardwick had received a direct hit from an enemy bomb. I was beginning to feel that I was going to be a survivor).\nThe interlude in Burnley, billeted with civilians in a little terraced house near Burnley F.C.'s ground at Turf Moor, was a pleasant one. We were rather spoiled by the motherly soul whose house it was. I'm sure she spent more on us than the billeting allowance she received from the Army. There were three of us in this billet, Gerry Winters, Wilson Jackson and myself. Wilson was a great cyclist who had been chosen for Olympic trials before the War. He lost no time in collecting his bike and thereafter cycled over the Peninnes every night to see his girl-friend Bessie in Huddersfield. Then next morning, he cycled back to Burnley in time for the first parade of the day. The lengths we would go to to see our girl friends.\nSCOTLAND 1940\nAll too soon we had to leave our 'cushy berth' in Burnley for fresh woods and pastures new. Our train journey this time took us through the lovely scenery of the westerly Yorkshire Dales, the Lake District and Cumbria and through lowland Scotland via Edinburgh and over the Forth Bridge into Fife, until, having crossed the county boundary, we arrived at Perth ' The Gate of the Highlands'. It was here, in the 'fair city', on the meadows of the North and South Inch, and on Kinoull Hill that our intelligence training really started, and where we began to learn the secrets of map reading, map making, field sketching etc in delightful surroundings and among very friendly and generous people.\nI have never been able to get to grips with Sir Walter Scott, great writer as he was, but I knew his 'Fair Maid of Perth', and I was very fond of the Serenade from Bizet's opera of the same name (immortalised by Heddle Nash). I was interested, therefore, to be able to see 'the Fair Maid of Perth's House', which stands on the site of the house in which lived the original 'Fair Maid' in the 14th century.\nWe were not to enjoy Perth for very long. Within a few weeks we were on the move again, after handing over our 'warehouse' accommodation to a regiment of Polish cavalry. I remember one Pole stopping me in the street and asking the way to the 'Eemka'; it took time for the penny to drop; he wanted the Y.M.C.A.!\nOur next home was on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, in the city of Dundee, one of the largest cities in Scotland, famous in the past for jute making, and for jam and marmalade (Mrs Keiller's renowned Dundee marmalade was first made in 1797). Here in Dundee, Headquarters Company was billeted in what had been a girls' reform school on Balgay Road. At the side of my bed space (still no beds) was a bell push with a sign that read 'In case of need ring for a mistress'. It must have been a hoax: I rang every night with no result.\nThe principal features of Dundee were the River Tay, with its famous bridge linking the counties of Angus and Fife and Dundee Law. The latter is a high, almost conical hill, overlooking Dundee to the south with marvellous views of the Tay and the Fife. To the east and north-east is the sea, with Arbroath visible on a clear day: to the north is rolling farming country towards Forfar - once the county town of Forfarshire, now called Angus, and Kirriemuir (scene of a bawdy Scottish song 'The Ball of Kirriemuir), and the foothills of the Grampian mountains. I remember Dundee Law for a very special reason. One night in early September, 1940, the whole Battalion 'stood to' from sunset to dawn, the Companies in various strategic position around the town. Six members of the Intelligence Section, including myself, climbed the Law in the gathering twilight and remained on watch through the night until the coming of a grey and cloudy dawn. During the night there was a great deal of aerial activity, and we huddled down in our 'capes' (dual purpose ground sheets) time after time as enemy aircraft flew over, seemingly armslength over our heads. The beams of numerous searchlights traversed the sky and occasional burst of anti-aircraft fire could be seen, and heard, over in the direction of Arbroath. At one point a searchlight was abruptly extinguished when a stream of bullets from a diving plane found their target down the searchlight's cone of light. A cold, damp, wind blew all night from the sea, and we were glad when daylight came and we were 'stood down'. It was many months afterwards that we were told the reason for our vigil: that night there had been an abortive sea-borne raid on the south-west coast of England and it had been feared that this could have been a diversion for a major enemy invasion at some other point or points on the shores of Great Britain.\nIn the last week of August Vera got leave from her work at Metro-Vickers and came to see me in Dundee. I had not seen her since the middle of June. She came with Bessie, Wilson Jackson's fiancee, who had wanted to come to Dundee but had been unable to because her father, wisely, had persuaded her not to come alone. She had never met Vera, but knowing of her through Wilson she wrote to ask her if she would accompany her to Dundee. Wilson and I were very happy at this arrangement and, when we knew the date, found accommodation for the girls with a Mr and Mrs Fraser at 18 Rosefield Street, not far from our billets. Mr Fraser was an engine driver, Mrs Fraser a jolly, buxom, apple cheeked lady of about fifty, who immediately took the girls under her wing and took good care of them during their stay, feeding then (and often Wilson and me) with substantial amounts of Scottish fare. They were allowed to entertain us in their bed sitting room, which was much better than holding hands in the cinema of an a park bench, though we did that as well. One evening the four of us were enjoying a kiss and cuddle in the bed sit when the came a thundering knocking on the door and a cry of 'put that lightout'. We hadn't the heart to go to the door and tell the air raid warden that the light had never been on! We were sorry to see the girls go home, but we had had a glorious week together, even though, some days, we were only able to meet them in the evening, after duties.\nThereafter we were always welcome at the Frasers, although we never visited them except by invitation. One occasion that I remember with special pleasure was an invitation to a Masonic 'Ladies Night', at which I sang for my supper, and Wilson's; when Mrs Fraser announced that I was to sing I saw the faces of two pretty young ladies fall. They had obviously had unhappy experiences of amateur singers. I was pleased to see, after my first song, that they were not displeased.\nAround the middle of September the powers-that-be decided we were getting too comfortable in Dundee and moved us a few miles further north to the little country town of Forfar. A letter of mine dated 23rd September 1940 expresses my first reaction to this move -\n'Personally I was very sorry to leave Dundee, I had made some very good friends there and also there was plenty to do on free nights. Forfar, on the other hand, is rather a dead-alive hole, the type of place where a Harvest Festival is considered an event. I may be prejudiced, however, by the fact that, yesterday, Sunday, was a particularly gloomy day; Sundays in Scotland are bad enough when the weather is fine.\nDundee had only two are raids while we were there, despite Lord Haw-Haw's claims that the docks are completely ruined. Forfar had been luckier still, it hasn't had an alarm yet, although a few weeks ago one of the Luftwaffe jettisoned a stick of bombs here whilst being chased by one of our Hurricanes. Luckily they landed in a turnip field and consequently did little damage - except to the turnips!'\nLater I was to revise my opinion of Forfar to a certain extent, after meeting more of the people, and after tasting my first Forfar 'bridies'. Our favourite haunt in Forfar was a little cafe run by a retired footballer who had played for Sheffield Wednesday - and Scotland - and who had a delectable daughter. Thus there were three great attractions, the good fare, interesting talk about football and flirting with the lovely lassie - not necessarily in that order! Other memories of Forfar are the pre-breakfast runs around the loch in the semi-darkness, with hoar frost on the grass and trees. Our section chose to do this in preference to the Sergeant Major's P.T. sessions. I don't know if this was the right choice: all I can remember is that I had appalling stiffness in my thighs and calves which lasted for days and days. After 4 weeks in Forfar we moved south-west across Scotland to the market town of Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire, just to the north of the Solway Firth. My letter of 10 November gives my first impressions of Castle Douglas and of our initial activities there -\n'We have been here three weeks now, having left Forfar on Friday 18th October, and these last three weeks have been weeks of intensive training. We have had route marches, company schemes, battalion exercises and Brigade manoeuvres apart from our routine stuff, and I must say that the Battalion chiropodist has had a busy time lately attending to blistered and sore feet - not excluding mine. We've had some pretty rotten weather since we came here, mostly rain and high winds, and these have contributed in no small degree to the discomforts of our training programme. Luckily we all have a full change of clothing, so - we don't suffer any ill effects from our many drenchings. We, the Intelligence Section, have a room and a kitchen in an evacuated house, and are lucky in having a couple of gas radiators which come in very handy for drying our clothes. Good use is made of them, too, when we have to scrub our webbing equipment in a hurry. Saturday night sees them festooned with rifle slings, respirator cases and straps, belts, bayonet frogs and anklets for Sunday morning church parade; many of them scrubbed at 23.00 hours on the owner's return from the cinema. I'm afraid I must plead guilty to this practice too.\nAs to Castle Douglas itself: although purporting to be the largest castle market in the south of Scotland, the town (giving it the benefit of the doubt) is quite small, consisting of three parallel streets, with smaller streets intersecting them at right angles. Entertainments are very few, consisting , apart from two public houses, of 2 cinemas - one of very diminutive proportions - and a Church of Scotland canteen. The cinemas change programmes three times weekly, but as we've already seen most of the films already it doesn't make much difference. However our section are hiring a radio, so we can always stay in and listen to that; in the meantime we play draughts and darts, write letters and read anything from Army pamphlets to 'Lilliput'.\nTonight I have my entertainment problem solved for me: I am on duty at Battalion Order Room (at hand with the Cipher codebook to decipher any messages that come through), a job which I don't mind because it usually gives me a chance to catch up on my correspondence.\nWe have a new scheme in progress here now. Each Company has sent a number of men to our section for training in Intelligence work with a view to them becoming snipers. This has put more work on our shoulders and I have already given half-a-dozen lectures on various aspects of Intelligence work.\nThere is a rumour in the ranks that we shall have a leave at Christmas, but this may only be wishful thinking....'\nAs a matter of fact, despite the inhospitable weather, we soon settled down to life in this sleepy market town, and, for a number of reasons, I began to enjoy myself. When the Battalion arrived in town, we were looked at by the natives with a certain amount of suspicion. They didn't immediately lock away their daughters, but I'm sure they kept a close watch on them and gave them strict warnings against becoming too closely involved with the 'brutal and licentious soldiery', especially the Sassenach variety! We certainly shocked then in a different way, when on the first Sunday, after morning Church parade and our Sunday dinner, we went out to the local playing-field and had a game of football. The heathen English desecrating the Sabbath day! Eventually a more liberal view prevailed when the good people of Castle Douglas realised that, after six days of hard work, we deserved some relaxation on the seventh. Whether the local clergy preached on the text 'The Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath' I don't really know.\nThroughout my Army service I found that the non-conformist Church parade always comprised the smallest number of men after the Roman Catholics. The greatest number attended Church of England Services not because they were all devout, or even practising, Anglicans, but because on being called up and being asked their religion they said 'C of E' because the majority of them had been baptised in an Anglican church and felt that they were nominally of that denomination. It was said that some men claimed to be Roman Catholic because there was always the possibility that there would not be a Catholic Church in the vicinity, and that they would, therefore be excused Church parades. I cannot see how this could be true because they would surely have been found out when, almost inevitably, they would have encountered a Catholic church or an R.C. priest. From my expereince R.C. soldiers almost invariably ended up on fatigues on Sunday morning if there was no service for them to attend. I have racked by memory but can think of no practising Jews in any unit to which I belonged. (Later in my service, and especially overseas - whether on active service or not - Church parades were discontinued, and it became a matter of personal preference or conscience whether one went to a religious service at all. Sometimes there were no services to attend, except, perhaps, on special occasions such as Easter, Christmas and New Year).\nIn Castle Douglas we non-conformists, few as we were, went to the Church of Scotland, which, to my surprise, was as near in liturgy and practice to the Methodist Church as it was possible to be, I felt at home straight away. In our number was my friend from Sheffield, Harry Yates, Gerry Winters and a man from the West Country whose name escapes me at the moment. After the service the Minister greeted us in porch and introduced us to his organist and c",

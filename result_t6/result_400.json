        "content": "SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP)  Nory Yamileth Hernndez and her three teenage children have been living in a battered tent under a bridge on the outskirts of San Pedro Sula since Hurricane Eta flooded their home in November.\nThey were there in the dust under the rumbling traffic, surrounded by other storm refugees, when Hurricane Iota hit barely two weeks later. And when the first migrant caravan of the year shuffled by in January, only fear and empty pockets kept them from joining Honduras growing exodus.\nI cried because I dont want to be here anymore, the 34-year-old Hernndez said. She had joined the first big caravan in October 2018, but didnt make it to Mexico before turning back. Shes sure she will try again soon. Theres a lot of suffering.\nIn San Pedro Sula, Honduras economic engine and the departure gate for thousands of Honduran migrants in recent years, families like Hernndezs are caught in a cycle of migration. Poverty and gang violence push them out and increasingly aggressive measures to stop them, driven by the United States government, scuttle their efforts and send them back.\nThe economic damage of the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastation wrought by Novembers hurricanes have only added to those driving forces. Word of a new administration in the U.S. with a softer approach to migrants has raised hopes, too.\nAfter her failed attempt to migrate in 2018, Hernndez returned to scraping out a living in San Pedro Sula. Last year, she sold lingerie door-to-door in one of the countrys most dangerous neighborhoods. But the storms wiped out her inventory and her customers had limited ability to pay her for items they bought on credit.\nI couldnt charge people because we all lost, Hernndez said. We all have needs, but you have to be sensitive. They dont have anything to pay with and why go to collect?\nChamelecon is a neighborhood of low, tin-roofed houses and small shops with barred windows on the outskirts of the city. Only two of its streets are paved, including one that is the dividing line between the rival gangs Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18.\nAt the bridge where Hernndezs tent is pitched, tattooed youths smoke marijuana and residents slop around in rubber boots. The violence continues, with newspapers talking about finding bodies wrapped in plastic.\nIn December, Hernndez got sick with fever, nausea and, she said, her brain hurt. She went to a hospital, but was never tested for COVID-19. In January, her eldest son writhed in their tent with fever.\nThe father of her youngest son lives in Los Angeles and encouraged her to get money together for another trip. He told me that this year is going to be good because they had gotten rid of Trump and the new president was going to help migrants, Hernndez said.\nWithin weeks, U.S. President Joe Biden signed nine executive orders reversing Trump measures related to family separation, border security and immigration. But fearing a surge in immigration, the administration also sent the message that little will change quickly for migrants arriving at the southern U.S. border.\nHernndez recently found work cleaning flooded streets, but she still hasnt been able to tackle the house where she once lived with 11 others. Its still filled with several inches of mud and foul water.\nThe assembly plants that surround San Pedro Sula and power its economy are still not back to pre-hurricane capacity amid the pandemic.\nThe Sula Valley, Honduras most agriculturally productive, was so heavily damaged that international organizations have warned of a food crisis. The World Food Program says 3 million Hondurans face food insecurity, six times higher than before. The dual hurricanes affected an estimated 4 million of Honduras 10 million people. The area is also Honduras hardest-hit by COVID-19 infections.\nIts a vicious cycle, said Dana Graber Ladek, head of the International Organization for Migration office in Mexico. Theyre suffering poverty, violence, the hurricanes, unemployment, domestic violence, and with that dream of a new (U.S.) administration, of new opportunities, theyre going to try (to migrate) again and again.\nThe last several attempted caravans have been foiled, first in Mexico and later in Guatemala, but the daily flow of migrants moved by smugglers continues and has shown signs of increasing. The hope and misinformation associated with the new U.S. administration helps that business too.\nThe traffickers are using this opportunity of desperation, of political changes in the United States to spread rumors and false information, Graber Ladek said.\nIn January, San Pedro Sula was abuzz with plans to migrate.\nGabriela, 29, feeling like she had nothing to lose, went north just days before a few thousand Hondurans headed out of San Pedro Sula on Jan. 15. She had lost her cleaning job in the pandemic and the rest of her life to the hurricanes. She asked that her full name be withheld because she had made it to southern Mexico and feared being targeted.\nGabriela paid a smuggler, paid off authorities along her route and walked through jungle as part of her journey north.\nShe had lived in La Lima, a suburb of San Pedro Sula. Small businesses there have begun to reopen, but in outlying neighborhoods, the streets are still full of debris, dead animals, snakes and burning mattresses.\nEveryone wanted to leave, said Juan Antonio Ramrez, an elderly resident. His children and grandchildren were among some 30 people who spent six days stranded on a corrugated metal roof surrounded by floodwaters in November. A lot of people went from here, but they all came back. The problem is theres a barrier and they send them back from Guatemala.\nAfter the 2018 caravans and rising number of migrants at the U.S. border in early 2019, the U.S. government pressured Mexico and Central American countries to do more to slow migration across their territories. Numbers fell in the latter half of 2019 and Mexico and Guatemala effectively stopped caravans in 2020. In December, a caravan leaving San Pedro Sula didnt even make it out of Honduras.\nBut the U.S. has reported a rising number of encounters at the border, showing that beyond the caravans, the migration flow is increasing again.\nIn September, Lisethe Contreras husband made it to Miami. The La Lima resident said it took him three months and $12,000 paid to smugglers. Shes thinking of going too, but for the moment has her small business selling necessities.\nBiden has promised investment in Central America to get at the root causes of immigration, but no one expects to see any change soon. Honduras primary elections are scheduled for March and nongovernmental organizations worry any aid will come with political strings attached.\nHernndez admits confusion and disillusion. I dont know. ... They all promise and then dont follow through, she said. I dont see a good future here.\nGabriela, already halfway to her goal of reaching the U.S., has no thoughts of turning back, even after 19 people, believed to be mostly Guatemalan migrants, were found shot and burned in northern Mexico just across from Texas.\nI only go back to Honduras if Immigration sends me back, she said. And if that happens Ill try again with my son.",

      "explanation": "The provided text focuses on the experiences of Honduran refugees and the factors driving their migration, primarily in the period around 2018 and after Hurricane Eta in 2020. While it mentions a caravan in October 2018, there is no mention of a photograph depicting trash left behind by that caravan.  The article does describe debris and other issues in the aftermath of hurricanes but does not include the specific photographic detail mentioned in the caption.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a significant amount of trash and debris, consistent with the caption's description. However, the caption makes a claim about the origin of the trash that is not visually verifiable.  The image itself provides no evidence linking the trash to a specific group of refugees traveling from Honduras to the United States in October 2018. The internal validation check highlights this discrepancy; the image only shows trash, not its origin. The external validation check further weakens the caption's claim. While the external source mentions a migrant caravan in October 2018 and the conditions faced by migrants, it provides no corroborating evidence or reference to the specific photograph of trash described in the caption.  There is no information within the image itself, nor in the external source, that could confirm or deny whether the trash shown in the photograph originated from a Honduran refugee caravan or any other specific source. The lack of visual or contextual evidence to support the claim that the trash is directly linked to the specific caravan mentioned in the caption lowers the confidence score. Both the internal and external validation processes point to the significant lack of evidence needed to support the claim made in the caption, hence the OOC is True. The uncertainty involved is high due to the lack of sufficient evidence for a definitive conclusion. Speculation about the trash's origin should be avoided due to lack of proof.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal insufficient evidence to support the claim that the image depicts trash left by a specific Honduran refugee caravan in October 2018. The image shows trash, but there is nothing to link it definitively to the stated origin. External sources mention a caravan but don't confirm the image's depiction."

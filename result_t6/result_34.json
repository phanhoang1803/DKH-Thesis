Clicking through on the social media post led users to a rogue website which displayed a fake CNN video announcing the supposed \"shocking\" death of the Smiths (along with some other adult content):\nThe purpose of this hoax appeared to be to bait users into clicking to view the video as a means of driving them to malicious web pages, and to trick them into sharing the hoax post on social media in order to spread it further. Users are strongly advised not to visit to the website that underlies this hoax post and not to click on anything displayed there.",

    "explanation": "The news caption claiming that Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith died in a car crash is completely false and out of context with the provided image. The image shows Will and Jaden Smith together, clearly alive and well.  The internal validation check found the caption to be fabricated with a confidence score of 10, citing the direct contradiction between the image and the caption's claim of their death.  The external validation, using a fact-check from Snopes.com, further reinforces this conclusion. Snopes explicitly debunks the death claim, labeling it as a hoax, also with a confidence score of 10. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks, both confidently asserting the falsity of the caption. No discrepancies or uncertainties exist. The visual evidence directly supports the internal and external findings.  There's no indication of image manipulation or miscontextualization; the image genuinely depicts Will and Jaden Smith. The internal and external checks are mutually reinforcing, providing strong evidence for the caption being entirely fabricated and out of context.  Given the robust validation from both sources, and the clear visual evidence, there is no ambiguity or need for conservative assessment.  Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is definitively out of context. The confidence score remains high at 10, representing a near-certainty in this judgment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly confirm that the caption is false and completely out of context with the provided image.  The image shows Will and Jaden Smith alive, directly contradicting the caption's claim of their death in a car accident. Snopes fact-check independently confirms that the death claim was a hoax."

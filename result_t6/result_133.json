        "content": "As nations around the world responded to the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, some social media users started circulating a video that they claimed showed North Korea leader Kim Jong Un blaming U.S. President Joe Biden for the war.\nAn Oct. 12 Instagram post features a video of Kim delivering a speech behind a lectern. Text at the start of the video claims it shows Kims speech about the Israel-Hamas war. He is speaking in Korean, but English captions were added.\n\"Under the Biden administration, conflicts erupt yearly,\" read the English captions as Kim speaks. \"This year a war begins between Israel and Palestine. Last year a war begins between Russia and Ukraine. And two years ago, billions worth of military equipment was left to the Taliban. Im afraid that if the Biden admin. Does not cease to exist in the next election, world war 3 may begin. Who knows what next years war will be. I support Donald Trump for President in 2024. Good Luck to Mr. Trump.\"\nThis post and others were flagged as part of Metas efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We also found this video shared on TikTok.\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nThe English captions do not reflect what Kim said in his address.\nA Google reverse image search revealed that Kim delivered this speech in October 2020, three years before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and more than a year before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\nIn the speech, made on Oct. 10, 2020, at a military parade, Kim warned he would \"fully mobilize\" North Koreas nuclear force if it was threatened, Politico reported. Kim also tearfully thanked his people for overcoming burdens, including the coronavirus pandemic, and apologized for not satisfactorily preventing North Koreans from experiencing hardships, according to The Korea Times, an English-language South Korean newspaper.\nThe BBC shared a clip that matched part of the video posted on Instagram, and reported that Kim said no one could appreciate North Korean troops \"heroic devotion\" without \"shedding tears of gratitude.\"\nThe National Committee on North Korea  a U.S.-based organization that says it supports \"principled engagement\" between the U.S. and North Korea to promote peace on the Korean peninsula  published an English translation of Kims speech produced by the Korean Central News Agency, a North Korean state media outlet.\nPolitiFact cross-referenced that translation with quotes included by English news organizations, which largely corroborated its accuracy.\nThe translated version of Kims speech did not include the words, \"Biden,\" \"Trump,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Russia,\" \"Ukraine,\" or \"Taliban.\"\nAnd although Kim mentioned that international sanctions had created challenges for North Koreans, he did not refer to the U.S. by name, Politico and CNN reported.\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram video claimed to show a speech in which Kim blamed Biden for the Israel-Hamas war and Russias invasion of Ukraine and said, \"I support Donald Trump for President in 2024.\"\nA reverse image search revealed that speech was from Oct. 10, 2020. A translation and news reports about the speechs content show that the English captions superimposed on the video are inaccurate. He did not mention Biden, Trump, Israel, Hamas, Russia or Ukraine.\nWe rate this claim False.",

      "confidence_score": 7,
      "explanation": "The provided text mentions a speech by Kim Jong-un in October 2020. While not specifically a New Year's speech, it does confirm Kim Jong-un delivering a speech.  The lack of precise date specification in the caption and the evidence's focus on debunking misinformation about a different speech make a definitive true/false assessment challenging. The evidence supports that Kim gave a speech, but not necessarily a New Year's speech.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 confirms Kim Jong-un gave a speech on October 10, 2020.  This aligns with the caption's statement that he gave a speech, although not necessarily a New Year's speech.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal validation gives high confidence (score 10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content showing Kim Jong-un delivering a speech. However, the external validation, while supporting that Kim Jong-un delivered a speech (score 7), does not confirm it was a New Year's speech. The external source mentions a speech in October 2020, not confirming the New Year's speech context given in the original caption.  The discrepancy lies in the temporal aspect of the speech â€“ the caption specifies a New Year's speech, which isn't definitively confirmed externally. The image itself does not provide explicit visual cues (like dates or banners) to determine whether it is a New Year's speech. While the image is internally consistent with the claim of Kim Jong-un delivering a speech, the lack of external confirmation of the specific \"New Year's\" aspect leads to the conclusion that the caption is potentially out of context. Considering the lower confidence score from external validation and the unresolved temporal discrepancy, the final assessment is that the caption is likely out of context. The visual analysis alone cannot fully confirm the temporal context of the speech shown.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's description of Kim Jong-un delivering a speech, however, external validation, while confirming a speech, does not corroborate the claim that the speech was delivered on New Year's Day. The discrepancy in the temporal context reduces the overall confidence in the accuracy of the caption."

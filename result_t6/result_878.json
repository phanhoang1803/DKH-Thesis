That meme claimed BLM had raised \"over a billion dollars\" but had not used that money to provide necessities such as food, housing, or schooling; instead, they had expended it on buying \"huge charter busses to transport members to riots\":\nAs for the first part of the meme, BLM is a \"decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people\"; it isn't a centrally organized group that was founded for the purpose of feeding the hungry, providing housing, or funding schooling, nor does it raise money on that basis.\nMoreover, the photograph accompanying this meme does not show any buses purchased by BLM \"to transport members to riots,\" or for any other purpose. The vehicles pictured here belong to the Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, who wrapped their buses with the Black Lives Matter name as a show of support for the movement, as documented on the Raptors' Twitter account:",

Snopes' investigation reveals the photo depicts buses belonging to the Toronto Raptors, which were wrapped with Black Lives Matter branding as a show of support.  The claim is thus demonstrably false.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the image depicts buses purchased by Black Lives Matter to transport members to riots.  Internal validation reveals that while the image shows buses with \"Black Lives Matter\" branding, there is no visual evidence supporting the claim about their use in transporting people to riots. The internal check flags this discrepancy and gives a low confidence score.  External validation, specifically the Snopes fact-check, decisively refutes the caption's claim. Snopes demonstrates that the buses in the image actually belong to the Toronto Raptors and were temporarily branded with Black Lives Matter messaging as a gesture of support.  The external validation provides strong evidence against the caption's narrative, with a high confidence score.  Both internal and external validation consistently point to the misrepresentation of the image's context in the original caption.  Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context (OOC=true), and the confidence score is high (10). There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks; both confirm the caption's inaccuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations independently confirm that the original caption is a misrepresentation. The image shows buses with Black Lives Matter branding, but they are not buses purchased by BLM to transport members to riots. Snopes confirms that the buses belong to the Toronto Raptors and were used as a show of support."

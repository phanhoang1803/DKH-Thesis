This video has been shared with a variety of claims. In some postings, this anaconda is listed as 50 feet long. In others, it's labeled as a more reasonable 10 meters (about 32 feet long):\nThis video has been severely distorted to make this snake appear much larger. While we can't say for certain just how big this snake really was, we can say that the snake appears much smaller than 10 meters long in the unedited version of this video.\nThe unedited version of this viral video has been circulating online since at least April 2018. While that video did not contain much information about where the footage was taken, the video's description was written in Portuguese, which is spoken by the majority of Brazilians.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ti6s_UStUc&feature=emb_title\nThe viral version of this video was stretched to make it appear as if his anaconda (and this \"river\") were much larger than they were in reality. The title of this video, \"sucuri gigante atravessando a estrada\" or \"giant anaconda crossing the road,\" also gives us some more context to help determine this snake's size. While the viral version of this video appears to show a \"50-foot snake\" crossing a wide river, it's clear that this video actually shows a snake crossing a flooded road.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is largely accurate in describing the video's content.  The video does show a large snake in what appears to be a flooded area, possibly a river, in a location that is described as being possibly Brazil.  However, both checks point out that there is uncertainty about the exact location and the veracity of claims about the snake's unusual size. The word \"supposedly\" in both the caption and the source material indicates a degree of uncertainty. The image itself provides visual confirmation of a large snake in an aquatic environment.  While the image aligns with the description, the lack of definitive confirmation of location and size leads to a lower confidence score and a verdict that the caption is out of context, due to the lack of absolute certainty regarding details stated in the caption. There is no evidence of visual manipulation or misrepresentation of the snake itself. The discrepancies arise from the uncertainty of the size of the snake and its exact location (though implied as Brazil). While the video's existence and core content (large snake in water) are verified, the complete accuracy of the claim is not fully substantiated.  Therefore, marking the caption as Out Of Context is conservative, given the uncertainty and the use of qualifiers like \"supposedly\" within the caption and source material itself.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree on the video's core content: a large snake in a body of water. However, uncertainties remain about the snake's size and the precise location, leading to a conclusion that the caption, while largely descriptive of the video, is out of context due to these unverified details."

      "explanation": "The statement is plausible given the historical context of US-China trade negotiations and President Trump's frequent use of optimistic language.  However, without access to specific details of the talks, the claim that negotiations were \"going very well!\" cannot be definitively verified.  The extension of talks into a third day is a common occurrence in such negotiations, suggesting a lack of immediate resolution but not necessarily a negative sign.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check reveals a discrepancy between the image and the caption. The image depicts the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, which is relevant to the subject of trade talks. However, it does not contain any visual evidence of US envoys, President Trump's presence, or the actual trade talks themselves.  The internal check thus concludes that the caption's claim lacks visual support within the image. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the caption's main assertion given the historical context of US-China trade relations and President Trump's known communication style. However, it notes the impossibility of definitively verifying the statement that negotiations were \"going very well.\"  The external check highlights the lack of direct verification for a statement of subjective assessment, as well as the fact that the extension of talks is common and doesn't imply anything about the progress or success of the talks. The external check's higher confidence score is largely based on circumstantial evidence, rather than visual evidence directly linked to the image.  This conflict between the internal and external validation approaches is crucial. While the external evidence suggests the general context is plausible, the image fails to directly support the caption's specific claims. The external check acknowledges that without access to direct evidence from the trade talks themselves, it's impossible to confirm or deny the statement that the negotiations were \"going very well.\"  Given the conflict and the lack of visual evidence, the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy is low. The absence of visual evidence for the core claim regarding the state of negotiations, despite the external validation suggesting the overall context as plausible, leads to the final assessment that the caption is out of context relative to the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the image lacks visual evidence for the caption's specific claims. The external check found the general context plausible but couldn't verify the specifics. The conflict and lack of visual support indicate a low overall confidence in the caption's accuracy relative to the image."

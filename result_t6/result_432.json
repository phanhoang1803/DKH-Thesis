        "content": "Claim:\nActress Jodie Foster said that attacking the rich is not envy, it's self-defense.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn image featuring a picture of actress Jodie Foster alongside a quote ostensibly uttered by her about wealth disparity in the United States being the cause of poverty is frequently circulated on social media:\nAttacking the rich is not envy. It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses solely on the image's visual content, confirming the presence of Jodie Foster. It does not assess the accuracy of the attributed quote.  The external check, however, uses a reliable source (Snopes) to definitively debunk the claim that Jodie Foster made the statement \"Attacking the rich is self-defense.\" Snopes traces the quote's origin to an unattributed online post and demonstrates that the attribution to Jodie Foster is false.  Therefore, there's a direct conflict: the internal check verifies the image subject, while the external check refutes the caption's claim about the subject's statement.  Given Snopes' reputation for factual accuracy, and the lack of any supporting evidence for the quote's connection to Jodie Foster, the external check's findings are given significantly higher weight.  The discrepancy arises because the internal check only considers the visual aspect (correct identification of Jodie Foster), while the caption's assertion goes beyond the visual and into factual territory, which is accurately addressed by the external check. The external check's high confidence score and detailed explanation outweighs the internal check's simple visual confirmation.  The caption is deemed out of context because the quote it attributes to Jodie Foster is demonstrably false according to a reputable fact-checking source. There is no visual evidence in the image itself to support or refute the statement attributed to Jodie Foster; the image is simply a photograph of her.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check verifies the image shows Jodie Foster; external check (Snopes) conclusively proves the attributed quote is false and not from her.  The caption is out of context due to the false attribution."

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the news caption's accuracy, although with slightly different focuses.  The internal check highlights the image's depiction of James Comey amidst a throng of reporters, which aligns with the context of an event generating significant media interest, such as an investigation into his firing. However, it points out that the investigation is not visually explicit in the image. The entity recognition aspect is partially accurate; \"Comey\" is correctly identified, while \"F.B.I.\" is implied but not visually present. The confidence score reflects this partial visual validation. The external check directly supports the caption's claim by referencing a source that explicitly mentions an FBI investigation into the firing of James Comey.  This source, however, focuses on the investigation's criminal aspect (obstruction of justice), whereas the caption mentions a potential national security threat.  This discrepancy is not necessarily a contradiction. The investigation likely encompassed multiple aspects, including national security concerns. Therefore, the external check's finding doesn't contradict the caption's, but rather provides a complementary perspective by detailing a specific aspect of the broader investigation. The higher confidence score from the external check reflects the direct corroboration from a reliable source.  Considering both the image context, and the external source providing supporting evidence, the caption is not out of context. The overall confidence score is determined by considering both checks, with greater weight given to the external corroboration due to its higher confidence score and direct evidentiary support. The image provides visual context that is largely consistent with the caption.  The discrepancy between the caption's focus on national security threat and the source's focus on obstruction of justice is addressed by acknowledging the broader scope of a likely multifaceted investigation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption's accuracy, with the external check providing direct corroboration from a reliable source.  A minor discrepancy in focus (national security vs. obstruction of justice) is explained by the likely multifaceted nature of the FBI investigation."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows an official road sign in Arizona warning drivers about parachuting cows.\nIn March 2021, a picture was circulated on social media that supposedly showed a sign on the side of a rural road warning drivers about airborne cattle. Actor Jason Alexander was one social media user who shared this picture along with a few questions about its origins:\nIs this sign warning drivers about parachuting cows? Is that a UFO in the process of abducting an unsuspecting bovine?\nAs far as we can tell, this photograph was taken somewhere in Arizona. In 2019, the Tucson news station KVOA posted a similar picture and reported that a handful of these \"unique warning signs\" had been spotted across southern Arizona:\nWhile this appears to be a genuine photograph of a road sign in Arizona, it is not an official road sign sanctioned by the Arizona Department of Transportation. Doug Nick, the Assistant Communications Director for Public Information for ADOT, confirmed to us that this was not an ADOT-produced sign, but noted that the gravel road shown in this image may not be maintained by the state's department of transportation.\nWhile ADOT could not confirm specifics about this sign, Nick assured us that parachuting cows were not a problem in the state. Nick noted, for instance, that cows lack the opposable thumbs necessary to pull a ripcord.\nPersonally, I have lived here all of my life and have yet to see a parachuting cow or other livestock for that matter.\nI'm not a pilot, but I would imagine that the logistical challenges of herding cattle into an aircraft, strapping a parachute on them and releasing them to plummet to the earth at tremendous speed would be daunting, at least.\nThen there's the vexing problem of the ethos that \"you pack your own chute.\" That's a sensible protocol for, say, the 101st Airborne. But as cattle have no opposable thumbs, this too becomes an insurmountable challenge and also raises the question of how a heifer, bull or steer would pull the ripcord while racing headlong (horn long)? into terra firma.\nOf course, the stereotypical cartoon image of the desert often involves the presence of a cattle skull resting near a bush or a cactus. That tableau is conceivable, but we seriously doubt any of those cattle deaths were the result of rapid deceleration blunt force trauma to an erstwhile airborne bovine.\nWhile parachuting cows may not be a known problem in the state, Arizona DOT does have an official road sign to warn drivers about ground-based cattle. The official sign features the same black cow as shown in the picture above, minus the UFO / parachute.\nHere's an example of the real Arizona cow sign:\nThe parachuting cow sign is, oddly enough, not the first such sign to grace the roads of Arizona. Here's a picture from photographer Tom Story showing a slightly different design of an unofficial Arizona road sign:\nStory wrote on Instagram that this photograph was taken near an airport in Coolidge, Arizona, sometime in the 1980s. The airport, according to Story, was an \"international center for skydiving for several decades.\" It seems plausible that some skydiver found the idea of a parachuting cow to be humorous and altered the sign.\nStory wrote: \"Throwback Thursday to the airport at Coolidge, AZ in the 1980s when this sign was along the road. The airfield was originally an Army Air Corps facility built in the Second World War and was an international center for skydiving for several decades. Scanned from the original color transparency.\"",

      "explanation": "The provided text explicitly states that a photograph shows a road sign in Arizona warning drivers about parachuting cows. While the evidence notes this is not an official sign from the Arizona Department of Transportation, it does confirm the existence of such a photograph and sign. Therefore, the caption's factual claim is supported.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both support the caption's claim. The internal check has high confidence (10) because the image directly shows a sign depicting a parachuting cow in what appears to be an Arizona roadside setting. The external check (confidence 8) confirms the existence of such a photograph circulating online, indicating a real-world sign, even if not an official one from the Arizona Department of Transportation.  There's a slight discrepancy in confidence scores, with the internal check being slightly more confident. This is likely because the internal check directly assesses the image content, while the external check relies on sourced information about the photo's existence and circulation, introducing a minor degree of uncertainty concerning the sign's exact origin and official status.  However, both checks agree on the core claim: a photograph exists showing a sign warning of parachuting cows in Arizona.  No visual tampering or miscontextualization was detected. The image aligns perfectly with the textual description in the caption. The slight difference in confidence scores is minor, and the overall agreement strongly supports the accuracy of the caption. There is no evidence to suggest the image is fabricated or misleading. Therefore, the caption is not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm the caption's accuracy.  The image clearly shows a sign depicting a parachuting cow, and external sources corroborate the existence of such a photograph.  A minor discrepancy in confidence scores is due to the external check relying on sourced information about photo circulation, which introduces some uncertainty about the sign's official status."

It purported that on her first full day in office, Harris had threatened that \"we will use federal law enforcement and the military\" against \"Trumpers ... [who] will beg me for a loaf of bread\":\nThese Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, its time to end this. They really dont get. We will block them in the courts, we will use federal law enforcement and the military. After Joe inflicts the death blow, Ill take the reigns [sic]. They will beg me for a loaf of bread.\nWe found no documentation that Harris said any such thing, however. Such controversial comments certainly would have been widely reported, yet a simple search turns up not a single related news account. Nor did any similar statement appear in Harris' social media accounts or in White House briefing room statements.\nThe meme claims the statement in question was made on Jan. 21, the first full day of the Biden-Harris administration, but Harris' recorded events that day were speaking briefly to the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting (during which she made no such comments) and participating in a call with World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHarris had delivered her first speech as vice president the day before, on Inauguration Day, but in that address she made no mention of former President Donald Trump or his supporters.\nBecause we could find no evidence whatsoever of this quotation's being legitimate, we rate this item \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "The provided image shows Kamala Harris giving a speech with Joe Biden in the background.  The image itself does not contain any visual evidence to support the claim made in the news caption that she threatened to use \"federal law enforcement and the military...against Trumpers.\" The internal check acknowledges this, giving a relatively low confidence score of 8 and correctly identifies that the threat and focus on \"Trumpers\" are not visually depicted, despite accurately representing Harris and the U.S. context.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim.  A Snopes fact-check specifically addresses the caption's statement and rates it as \"False,\" citing a lack of supporting evidence in any reporting or official statements. This external check gives a high confidence score of 10, offering substantial evidence to refute the caption's claim. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks lies in the interpretation of the image's context. While the internal check focuses on the image's visual limitations, the external check directly validates the falsity of the caption's core claim.  This external validation carries more weight, as it involves verifying the claim against real-world sources and not solely relying on visual interpretation. The combination of the internal check's limited visual assessment and the external check's strong evidence of falsity leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization evident in the image. The image simply depicts a speech; the caption adds an unsubstantiated and false claim about the speech's content.  No visual details contradict or support the false claim; the image is neutral with respect to the claim.  Therefore, the overall assessment concludes that the caption is out of context, with high confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags the caption as potentially inaccurate due to lack of visual evidence of the alleged threat. External check confirms the caption's falsity with a Snopes fact-check, providing strong evidence against the claim. Both checks converge to indicate the caption is out of context."

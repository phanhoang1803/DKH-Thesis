        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows \"CNN reporter\" Jade Sacker filming a pro-Trump mob storm the U.S. Capitol.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, a large group of U.S. President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, which resulted in the death of a police officer and four other individuals, some of Trump's backers floated the evidence-free claim that this attempted insurrection was actually the work of antifa. While the claim that antifa was responsible for the attack has been dismissed by the FBI, this rumor continued to circulate on social media.\nOn Jan. 15, 2021, a slight wrinkle was added to this rumor: Not only was antifa responsible for the attack, but so was CNN. A viral video supposedly showing \"CNN's Own\" Jade Sacker quickly racked up more than 2 million views as it circulated on Twitter. Other postings of this video labeled Sacker as \"CNN photojournalist\" or \"CNN reporter.\"\nHere's a screenshot of one such posting.\nWhile this video was widely shared as if it showed a woman named Jade Sacker, we have not been able to independently verify this. If this video truly does show Sacker, however, it's important to note Sacker is not an employee of CNN. Describing her as \"CNN's own\" or \"CNN reporter Jade Sacker\" is inaccurate.\nSacker is a freelance photojournalist who documented the pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. She is not, nor has she ever been, employed by CNN.\nMatt Dornic, the head of strategic communications for CNN Worldwide, wrote on Twitter that \"no one named Jade Sacker works for CNN.\"\nSo, where does this rumor come from?\nOn the evening of Jan. 6, Sacker appeared on \"Anderson Cooper 360\" alongside a man named John Sullivan to talk about what they saw during the Capitol riot. Specially, these two appeared on the network to discuss a piece of footage captured by Sullivan that showed the shooting death of a woman inside the Capitol. Here's a screenshot from that interview:\nSacker appeared on CNN because she was a witness to the Capitol riot, not because she was employed by CNN, or because she was hired by the network to report from the event.\nIt should be noted that Sullivan was arrested by the FBI for his alleged involvement in the riot a few days after this interview. While Sullivan claims that he was at the Capitol to document the event as a journalist, the FBI affidavit notes that Sullivan can be heard on video yelling things like \"we about to burn this shit down\" and \"we accomplished this shit. We did this together. Fuck yeah! We are all a part of this history.\"",

    "explanation": "The internal check found no visual evidence within the provided image to support the claim in the caption. The image depicts a person filming inside a building that appears to be the U.S. Capitol, but there is no evidence to support the claim that this person is Jade Sacker, a CNN reporter (as claimed in the caption), or that the event depicted shows a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol.  The external check, however, found strong evidence supporting the existence of a video showing Jade Sacker filming such an event. While this external evidence corroborates part of the caption (the existence of a video showing someone filming the pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol), it also reveals crucial information missing from the caption: that Jade Sacker is not a CNN reporter, contradicting the original caption's claim.\n\nThe discrepancy arises because the internal check relies solely on the provided image, which lacks sufficient information to confirm the identities of individuals or the exact context of the filming. The external check, on the other hand, relies on information from another source describing the video's content, and while that source verifies the existence of a video consistent with the core of the caption's description, it corrects the inaccurate claim about Ms. Sacker's employment status. This implies that while a video exists that broadly aligns with the caption's description of a person filming a pro-Trump mob at the Capitol, the detail specifying Jade Sacker as a CNN reporter is inaccurate, rendering the caption misleading.\n\nThe high confidence score from the external check is due to the corroboration of the event depicted in the video. However, the low confidence score of the internal check and the factual inaccuracy regarding Ms. Sacker's profession lead to a final conclusion that the caption is out of context. The caption is partially true (a video exists showing someone filming a pro-Trump mob at the Capitol), but it is misleading because it incorrectly identifies the person filming and their employment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found no evidence in the image to support the caption. External check confirmed the existence of a video consistent with the main description but revealed a critical error: the person filming is not a CNN reporter as claimed. This discrepancy leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

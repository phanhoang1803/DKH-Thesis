He is being investigated under controversial internet laws.\nHuman rights monitors say the protests have been followed by a wave of detentions targeting dozens of critics.\nMr Alam, 63, says he has been beaten in custody, and international human rights organisations have joined a roster of global artists and writers, including hundreds of photographers, in demanding his release.\nFor decades he has used his camera to chronicle events in Bangladesh and his pictures have been published widely in leading newspapers and magazines. As the founder of the Drik picture agency and a respected photography school, Shahidul Alam is also credited with nurturing a generation of Bangladeshi photographers.",

    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows a moderate level of confidence (confidence score 8) that the caption accurately describes the image. The image depicts a paddy field at night, aligning with the caption's description of a \"rice paddy field\".  However, the location (Bangladesh) and the photographer's association with the \"Crossfire\" photo story are not visually verifiable within the image itself. The external check, on the other hand, reveals a low confidence score (4) and casts doubt on the specific details of the caption.  Although external sources confirm Shahidul Alam's photography in Bangladesh, they do not corroborate the existence of a photo titled 'Crossfire' from November 17, 2009, depicting this particular rice paddy field.  The discrepancy between the internal and external checks stems from the inability to verify the details surrounding the \"Crossfire\" project and the specific date. The image itself, while consistent with a rice paddy field, lacks identifying features to confirm the location and the specific context provided in the caption. Thus, despite internal coherence, the lack of external corroboration on the specific details given in the caption leads to the conclusion that there is a higher chance that the caption is out of context.  The visual aspects of the image are not tampered with or misrepresented; however, the caption's claim to be part of a specific photo story and date requires more substantial evidence to validate. Overall, the weak external evidence, coupled with some uncertainty in verifying the specific photo project and date, decreases the confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows moderate confidence in the image description, while the external check casts doubt on the specific details of the caption, including the photo project and date. The low confidence score from external verification outweighs the internal consistency, leading to an 'out of context' assessment."

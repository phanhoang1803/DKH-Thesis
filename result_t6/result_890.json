        "content": "Hillary Clinton has endured an 11-hour hearing before a Congress committee over the deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.\nThe former secretary of state said she took responsibility and introduced reforms after the attack that killed four Americans, including the US envoy.\nShe deflected criticism that she did not do enough to protect the mission.\nHer Democratic party says the Republican-led panel is a witch-hunt trying to harm her presidential bid.\nDespite the committee sitting in four consecutive hours-long sessions on Thursday, the hearing yielded little new information.\nMrs Clinton remained composed during the highly-anticipated testimony, amid several heated exchanges between Republicans and her Democrat allies.\nIn her opening statement, she said she had asked Chris Stevens, one of the four killed, to go to Libya as US envoy.\n\"After the attacks I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket,\" she said.\n\"I took responsibility, and as part of that before I left office I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.\"\nFive key questions on the latest Benghazi hearing\nMrs Clinton said her appearance was her way of honouring the lives lost, and she called on those present to put national security above partisan politics.\nDemocratic Representative Elijah Cummings, seated next to the chairman, said Republicans were wasting taxpayer money in an effort to derail Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign.\nMrs Clinton is defending her record before, during and after the Benghazi attacks largely as she has before - taking responsibility for the mistakes, talking about lessons learned, and owning her policy positions.\nThe new element is her email record, which she has downplayed. She told lawmakers that most of her work on Libya and Benghazi wasn't done by email, mentioning an occasion when an intelligence report had to be carried to her by briefcase and read on the spot.\nThe tone has been largely measured, and the testiest exchange didn't actually involve Mrs Clinton.\nCommittee chairman Trey Gowdy has latched onto the role of a Clinton friend, Sidney Blumenthal, who sent her numerous intelligence reports on Libya by email.\nHe's suggesting Mr Blumenthal unduly influenced her Libya policy and had greater access to her than her Benghazi ambassador, Chris Stevens, who was killed.\nDemocratic committee members erupted in denial and demanded Mr Blumenthal's testimony transcripts be released, while Mrs Clinton looked on detached and bemused\nThere have already been seven congressional investigations into the attack, by suspected Islamist militants, on the US compound in the Libyan city of Benghazi on 11 September 2012.\nThe raid led to the deaths of ambassador Chris Stevens and three other US embassy staff.\nMrs Clinton said Mr Stevens was well aware of the risks of his job but withdrawing American presence from Libya would have been a mistake, she said.\n\"To retreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our ability to lead.\"\nWhen the US pulls out of places, extremists gain a foothold, she added, although she did admit that security requests made by the Benghazi consulate were not met.\nAn independent review board found deficiencies within the State Department that the Obama administration has tried to fix, said the former first lady.\nWhat are the possible consequences for Clinton?\nThe committee does not have the power to punish but depending on the conclusions there could be political consequences for Hillary Clinton, which might affect her presidential campaign\nWhat did Clinton know about security requests?\nShe has said in previous testimony that requests for additional security didn't reach her level. But she has taken responsibility for the failure. And the State Department review laid out steps to improve security at diplomatic missions.\nWhat did the other Congressional committees find?\nThis is the eighth congressional investigation. Previous committees criticised Mrs Clinton and the Obama administration on a number of points, especially the poor security at the Benghazi mission. And the intelligence was flawed.\nWhat is there left to discover?\nThe committee has suggested there will be new evidence of how poorly the state department responded to security requests for the Benghazi mission, and new evidence on how the military responded to the attack.\nRead Barbara Plett Usher's answers in full",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that Hillary Clinton was accidentally killed during the filming of a documentary.

    "explanation": "The internal check, based solely on the image and caption, confirms the presence of Hillary Clinton in the image and mentions her in the caption. However, this is insufficient to validate the caption's claim about her accidental death during a documentary filming.  The external check decisively refutes the caption. The external check points out the absence of any credible news or evidence supporting the claim of Hillary Clinton's accidental death during the filming of a documentary. This discrepancy highlights the critical importance of external validation in verifying claims. The significant difference between the internal and external confidence scores (10 vs. 1) further underscores the unreliability of the internal check alone in this case.  The caption's claim is completely unsubstantiated by the image and external evidence; therefore, the caption is demonstrably out of context. The image simply shows Hillary Clinton speaking, providing no evidence related to her death or any filming accident.  No visual evidence supports the claim. In the absence of any visual or other supporting elements from the image, the caption is completely unfounded and fabricated.  The claim contradicts widely known facts about Hillary Clinton being alive.  Relying solely on an internal check in this instance would be misleading and dangerous as it fails to engage with widely available verifiable information. The low confidence score reflects the complete lack of supporting evidence for the caption's assertion.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation only partially supports the caption by identifying Hillary Clinton. However, external validation strongly refutes the caption's claim of her accidental death during a documentary filming. This substantial disagreement, along with the absence of any supporting visual evidence, makes the caption demonstrably out of context."

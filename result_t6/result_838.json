        "content": "In August 2019, Brazils National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported an increase in fires in the Amazon rainforest. As this news started to circulate on social media, so, too, did arresting images of forest fires. However, many of these photographs were outdated and unrelated to the current fires in Brazil.\nWe mentioned two of these outdated photographs in a previous article about the recent fires in the rainforest. These photographs were shared by a wide range of celebrities, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and YouTube star Logan Paul:\nThe photograph shared above by Paul was actually taken in the Amazon in 1989, not 2019. The photograph shared by DiCaprio has been online since at least 2012 when it was published in a Nature article about another spate of fires in the rainforest.\nSeveral other outdated or unrelated photographs have also been shared as if they showed the fires in the Amazon rainforest in 2019. Actor David Licauco posted three other pictures, none of which were taken this year:\nThe photographs on the left of this collage were addressed above (top left from 1989, bottom left from at least 2012). The picture on the top right was taken in 2008 in Brazil by photographer Daniel Beltra. The picture on the bottom right of this collage has even less to do with the current fires in Brazil: It comes from a fire in Bitterroot National Forest in Montana in August 2000.\nPhotographs supposedly showing animals harmed in the recent Amazon rainforest fires also made their way around social media. Again, these photographs are genuine but are not related to the recent spate of fires:\nThe image on the top left was previously addressed (from 1989). The photograph on the top right shows a fire in Brazil in 2014. The photograph of monkeys on the bottom left was taken by photographer Avinash Lodhi in Jabalpur, India, in April 2016. The image on the right of the burned rabbit was taken during a forest fire near Malibu, California, in November 2018.\nAs the above-displayed photographs went viral in August 2019, a counter-set of images supposedly showing how it was raining in Brazil were also circulated on social media:\nThese photographs, again, have little to do with the weather in Brazil in August 2019. The photograph on the left dates back to at least 2009 and image on the right was taken from a YouTube video supposedly showing a storm in Ecuador in 2013.\nSo what do the August 2019 fires in the Amazon actually look like? Here's a video report from NBC News:\nWhile many of the viral photographs in circulation do not accurately depict the fires in the Amazon rainforest in August 2019, the area has seen a large number of fires this year. Brazils INPE reported more than 70,000 fires have burned in Brazil this year, an 80% increase compared to the number of fires during the same period in 2018.\nThe fires have raised concerns about deforestation, global warming, and the environmental policies of Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro.\nThe BBC reported:\nThe official figures show more than 75,000 forest fires were recorded in Brazil in the first eight months of the year  the highest number since 2013. That compares with 40,000 in the same period in 2018.\nForest fires are common in the Amazon during the dry season, which runs from July to October. They can be caused by naturally occurring events, such as by lightning strikes, but also by farmers and loggers clearing land for crops or grazing ...\nActivists say the anti-environment rhetoric of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has encouraged such tree-clearing activities.\nIn response, Mr Bolsonaro, a long-time climate change sceptic, accused non-governmental organisations of starting the fires themselves to damage his government's image ...\n... The Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam) has stated the recent increase in the number of fires in the Amazon is directly related to deliberate deforestation.\nWhile the exact scale of deforestation in the rainforest will only be certain when 2019 figures are published at the end of the year, preliminary data suggests a significant rise.\nThe National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) tracks suspected deforestation in real-time using satellite data, sending out alerts to flag areas that may have been cleared...",

    "explanation": "The internal validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy. The image clearly depicts a sunset over a river with boats moored at the riverbank. This aligns perfectly with the caption \"Sunset over a river.\" However, the external validation fails to find any relevant information connecting the image to any external source or context. The discrepancy arises from a lack of external context rather than an internal contradiction.  The external check attempts to link the image to Amazon rainforest fires, an entirely unrelated topic, resulting in a false negative.  Since the external check provides no relevant information and the internal check is highly confident (confidence score of 10), the external validation's verdict is disregarded. However, the absence of external corroboration significantly lowers the overall confidence score.  The image itself is internally consistent; there's no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The sunset scene, the river, and the boats along the riverbank are all visibly present and naturally consistent with one another.  The primary reason for the low confidence score is the lack of any external verification.  Without external data points to support the internal assessment,  it's not possible to definitively rule out the possibility of the image being mislabeled, manipulated, or simply taken out of context, despite the high degree of internal consistency. In summary, the absence of external evidence necessitates a cautious approach, leading to a low confidence score despite the strong internal validation supporting the caption's accuracy. To increase the confidence score, additional information is needed, for example, geographic location data, date and time of capture, or references to similar images from a trusted source. This additional information can verify the scene and strengthen the overall assessment.",

Such claims have been passed around the Internet since October 2001, playing on fears of receiving hazardous substances in the mail.\nThese type of spurious emails tend to resurface periodically; in June 2017 residents in Melbourne, Australia reported receiving their own batch of messages about \"fatal perfumes.\"",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that smelling the perfume \"Lovely\" causes death, either instantly or within three days.  This claim is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.\n\nInternal validation reveals a significant discrepancy between the image and the caption. The image shows a perfume bottle labeled \"Lovely,\" providing no visual evidence to support the claim of fatal consequences from smelling it. The internal check correctly identifies this lack of evidence, assigning a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False.\n\nExternal validation strongly refutes the caption's claim. The external check cites Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, which explicitly labels the claim as false. This provides robust external evidence, with a high confidence score of 10 and a verdict of False.\n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. Both methods independently confirm that the caption is factually inaccurate and out of context. The image shows a perfume; the caption makes a false and unsubstantiated claim about its lethality. There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization in the image, which simply depicts the perfume bottle.\n\nThe high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong corroboration between the internal analysis, which identifies the lack of supporting evidence in the image, and the external verification from a reliable source (Snopes.com), which directly contradicts the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the original caption is demonstrably out of context. The claim it makes is unsubstantiated, contradicted by visual evidence from the image, and explicitly refuted by a reliable fact-checking website. Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is out of context (OOC: True) is reached with high confidence (confidence_score: 10).",

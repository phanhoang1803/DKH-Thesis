        "content": "A British-Ghanaian photographer, whose images captured major social and political changes in London and Accra during the 1950s and 1960s, is having his work exhibited on Piccadilly Circus's big screens, as part of a major retrospective.\nJames Barnor's work will be displayed at 20:21 BST, for 150 seconds, every night throughout April, followed by an exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in May.\nDespite a photography career lasting more than six decades, the 91-year-old became widely known only after an exhibition at the Black Cultural Archives in 2007.\nBorn in 1929 in Accra, Barnor worked as a photojournalist before establishing the Ever Young portrait studio in the Ghanaian capital.\nHis photography during the 1950s captured the nation as it moved towards independence.\nIn 1959, Barnor moved to London to study photography and further develop his skills.\nIn the UK he worked on assignments for South Africa's Drum magazine, often shooting cover images of black fashion models against London backdrops.\nHis photography also captured the experiences of London's burgeoning African diaspora.\nBarnor returned to Ghana in the 1970s, where he established the country's first colour processing lab while continuing his work as a portrait photographer.\nHe relocated again to London in the 1990s.\nFollowing the 2007 exhibition at the Black Cultural Archives, Barnor's work was featured in a number of international exhibitions and gradually became more widely recognised.\nReflecting on his career, Barnor says: \"I [once] came across a magazine with an inscription that said, 'A civilisation flourishes when men plant trees under which they never sit.'\n\"But it's not only plants - putting something in somebody's life, a young person's life, is the same as planting a tree that you will not cut and sell.\n\"That has helped me a lot in my work - sometimes, the more you give, the more you get.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that Erlin Ibreck was a Drum cover model in Trafalgar Square, London in 1966. Source 1 mentions that James Barnor worked for Drum magazine in London during the 1960s, shooting cover images of black fashion models against London backdrops. While the source doesn't name Erlin Ibreck specifically, it strongly suggests that the caption's description of a Drum cover model in London during that period is plausible.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds strong evidence supporting the caption's accuracy.  The image clearly shows a woman, possibly Erlin Ibreck, in Trafalgar Square, London.  The style of clothing and the overall aesthetic aligns with the 1960s timeframe mentioned in the caption. The presence of pigeons further supports the Trafalgar Square setting.  The external validation provides supporting evidence, although not directly confirming the model's identity. Source 1 points to James Barnor's work for Drum magazine in London during the 1960s, focusing on black fashion models in London locations.  This corroborates the caption's claim about a Drum cover model in London during that era. While the external source doesn't explicitly name Erlin Ibreck, the contextual alignment is strong.  There is no direct contradiction between internal and external evidence.  The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty â€“ the internal check is highly confident, while the external one is moderately confident due to the lack of explicit mention of Erlin Ibreck in the source. However, the converging evidence strongly suggests the caption is accurate. Visual analysis shows no signs of tampering or miscontextualization. The image's details align with the caption's description:  The woman's attire, the background, and the presence of pigeons in Trafalgar Square are all consistent with the information provided. In conclusion, the strong internal evidence and the corroborative external evidence, although not definitive regarding the model's name, suggest the caption accurately depicts the image's content.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption's accuracy, although the external check offers less direct confirmation of the model's identity. The overall consistency between the image, caption, and external context suggests a high likelihood of accuracy."

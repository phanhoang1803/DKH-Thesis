    "explanation": "The claim in the original news caption is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  Internal validation notes that while the image shows Donald Trump with his mother and another man wearing a robe with symbols that *could* be associated with the KKK, the image alone is insufficient to confirm this definitively. The caption's claim is therefore uncertain based on visual evidence alone.  However, external validation from Snopes provides conclusive evidence that the image is a hoax, a manipulated image where the individuals were digitally altered to appear as if they are wearing KKK robes. Snopes presents the original unaltered image as proof.  There is complete agreement between internal and external evidence that the caption is inaccurate; the internal analysis only highlights the ambiguity of the manipulated image itself and does not endorse the claim made in the caption.  The discrepancy lies in the degree of certainty. Internal validation acknowledges uncertainty due to the image manipulation and the potential for misinterpretation, giving a lower confidence score. External validation, supported by Snopes's evidence, offers higher confidence in debunking the caption's claim because it presents irrefutable proof of the image's manipulation.  Given the definitive evidence from Snopes, the final verdict is that the caption is completely out of context, with a high confidence score of 10.  The visual evidence, once the manipulation is revealed, supports the external validation's conclusion. No other external sources were found that contradict Snopes's findings.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively refute the original caption.  Internal analysis flags the ambiguity of the manipulated image, while external verification from Snopes confirms the image is a hoax, proving the caption is entirely false."

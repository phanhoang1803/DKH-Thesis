    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that Marla Maples, President Trump's second wife, died in a plane crash in April 2017. This claim is factually incorrect and is deemed out of context.  The internal check, with a confidence score of 0, correctly identifies the image as Marla Maples but flags the death claim as false. The external check, with a confidence score of 10, provides strong evidence from a Snopes fact-check article.  The Snopes article explicitly debunks the claim, stating that reports of her death in a plane crash are fake news, reusing images from a 1997 incident involving a downed cargo jet.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks that the caption is false. The visual evidence in the image shows Marla Maples, who is still alive. There is no visual evidence of a plane crash or any indication that the image is manipulated or miscontextualized to create a false narrative. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong and consistent evidence from both internal analysis and reputable external fact-checking sources confirming the falsity of the original caption. The caption is demonstrably false and completely out of context with the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively confirm that the caption is false. The image depicts Marla Maples, who is still alive, contradicting the caption's claim of her death in a plane crash.  Snopes fact-check corroborates this conclusion."

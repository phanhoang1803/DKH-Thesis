Bush addressed Americans the evening of the 9/11 terror attack and where former President Donald Trump spoke about the coronavirus outbreak on March 11, 2020.\nAfter Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on April 13, one social media user claimed President Joe Biden planned to address the American public in a similar way.\n\"BREAKING NEWS: 5:34 President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight, following Irans attack on Israel,\" read a screenshot shared April 13 on Threads.\nThe post featured five siren emojis and the words: \"I was really hoping not to see this. This isnt good.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Metas efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)\nIts easy to understand why the idea of Biden addressing the nation from the Oval Office might have alarmed social media users, but theres one problem: The claim was inaccurate.\n(Screenshot from Threads.)\nWe found no media reports about Biden addressing the nation from the Oval Office the same day Iran attacked Israel. Biden released an April 13 statement condemning the attacks and describing how the U.S. military had helped defend Israel.\n\"The U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week,\" he said in the statement. \"Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.\"\nBiden said he would meet with other leaders of the Group of Seven, or G7, the worlds leading economies, \"to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Irans brazen attack.\" The G7 leaders also released an April 14 statement condemning the attack.\nBiden did not announce plans to address the nation, and there is no record of such an address on the White House website or the White Houses YouTube channel.\nPolitico reported that Biden \"deliberately kept a low public profile\" following Irans attacks against Israel in an effort to deescalate the situation.\nWhite House advisers speaking on condition of anonymity told Politico a public address was discussed, but there werent immediate plans for Biden to deliver one. Two officials said advisers felt that a televised presidential address \"would likely escalate the tensions,\" Politico reported April 14.\nOval Office addresses are infrequent.\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the nation June 2, 2023, from the White Houses Oval Office. He speech covered the budget deal that lifts the federal debt limit and averts a U.S. government default. (AP)\nBiden gave his first Oval Office address in June 2023 after Congress passed a bipartisan bill that would raise the federal borrowing limit and keep the U.S. from defaulting on its debt. In October, following Hamas attack on Israel, Biden gave his second Oval Office address, explaining why he believed financial support for Ukraine and Israel was critically important.\nWe contacted the White House for comment and received no reply.\nWe rate the claim that Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office on April 13 \"following Irans attack on Israel\" False.",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check finds high confidence in the image depicting President Trump in what seems to be the Oval Office, delivering a speech.  The external check corroborates this by citing a specific instance of President Trump addressing the nation from the Oval Office on March 11, 2020, regarding the coronavirus outbreak. The external source provides additional examples of past presidents using the Oval Office for national addresses, further strengthening the context. There are no discrepancies or uncertainties between the internal and external checks; both align perfectly.  The visual evidence within the image—the setting resembling the Oval Office, Trump's attire and demeanor consistent with a presidential address—fully supports the caption. No visual tampering or miscontextualization is detected.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) reinforce the accuracy assessment. Considering the complete alignment of visual evidence, internal analysis of textual entities, and external corroboration from a reliable source, the conclusion is that the caption accurately reflects the image's content. The image is not out of context.",

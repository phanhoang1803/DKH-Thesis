Some joked about this being a real video of a living triceratops, some pondered if it was possible, while others simply wondered what the heck was going on.\nFor starters, this is not a living and breathing triceratops. The rhinoceros-looking dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period  about 68 million years ago  but went extinct along with all other non-avian dinosaurs during the CretaceousPaleogene (KPg) extinction event about 66 million years ago. In other words, it would be unusual to see a living, breathing triceratops in the wild today.\nThis video actually features a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia called Mojosemi Forest Park. While we're not exactly certain how this puppet was created, a longer video from this dino-themed amusement park appears to show that this triceratops is operated possibly by two people inside of an elaborate costume:\nhttps://fb.watch/2oxNZxaLhE/\nWhile some may have taken pause when they first saw the triceratops video, other videos from Mojosemi Forest Park clearly show that dinosaurs have not actually been brought back from extinction.\nhttps://fb.watch/2oyqfR9Klr/",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the accuracy of the news caption. The internal check found the image consistent with the caption, showing a large triceratops statue being transported, seemingly to a location in Indonesia.  The high confidence score reflects the clear visual evidence of a triceratops-like statue and the contextual clues suggesting Indonesia as the location.  The external check further corroborated this, citing a source explicitly stating that the video shows a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia.  There were no discrepancies or uncertainties found between the internal and external checks. The visual evidence aligns perfectly with the description provided in the caption and supporting source.  No visual tampering or miscontextualization was detected.  The consistent descriptions across the image and the text sources contribute to the high confidence score.  The image clearly shows a large statue resembling a triceratops, which is consistent with the caption's description. The setting also appears to be outdoors, fitting the context of a theme park. The presence of personnel involved in the transport further supports the inference of a planned installation, bolstering the claim of a theme park.  The high confidence scores of both 10, from internal and external validation, combine to provide an extremely high level of confidence that the caption accurately describes the image's contents. The comprehensive agreement between visual evidence, internal analysis, and external verification leaves no room for doubt about the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm the caption's accuracy.  The image clearly depicts a triceratops statue in what seems to be Indonesia, aligning perfectly with the caption and an external source describing it as a puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia."

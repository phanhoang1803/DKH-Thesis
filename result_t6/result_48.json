According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\nRobs a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com  where the story originated  clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

      "explanation": "The news caption is largely supported by Source 1.  The source describes a 29-year-old Calgary resident who suffered extensive lower body injuries after attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke. The caption accurately reflects this core information. While the source mentions the loss of testicles, the caption focuses on more general \"extensive injuries to his lower body.\" The source also indicates the event happened on a Thursday night, aligning with the caption's timeframe. However, the source explicitly states that the original report was a hoax, creating a degree of uncertainty.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check yielded a confidence score of 8, indicating that the caption's claim about the location is neither confirmed nor denied by the image itself. This is because the image provides no information about the location of the event. The external check, however, produced a confidence score of 8, primarily relying on a news source that corroborates the core details of the caption. This source mentions a 29-year-old Calgary resident sustaining lower-body injuries from an attempt to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke. The timing also matches. However, a critical discrepancy emerges: the external source states that the original report was a hoax.  This casts significant doubt on the authenticity of the event described in both the caption and the source. While the core details (age, location, nature of the injury, and general timeframe) align between the caption and the source, the hoax revelation undermines the overall credibility. Therefore, we must consider the possibility of misreporting, manipulation, or fabrication.  The visual evidence, comprising a damaged scuba tank and a scene suggestive of a medical emergency, does not explicitly contradict the caption, but also doesn't independently confirm the specific circumstances. The lack of clear visual evidence linking the damaged scuba tank to the 'weed smoke' incident is a significant weakness. Given the conflict between supporting evidence from external sources and a revealed hoax status, it is not possible to establish the caption's accuracy with high certainty. The external source's revelation of a hoax significantly outweighs the partial corroboration provided by the superficial similarity between the caption and the reported hoax.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check is neutral regarding location, while the external check finds partial corroboration, but also reveals the original report was a hoax, making the claim dubious. Visual evidence does not provide definitive confirmation or denial. The hoax element significantly reduces the overall confidence."

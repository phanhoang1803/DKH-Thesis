        "date": "2020-06-03T06:23:37",
        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Donald Trump (or his administration) has the legal authority to designate antifa as a terrorist organization.\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on May 31, 2020, that the United States would be designating \"ANTIFA\" as a \"Terrorist Organization.\"\nTrump's tweet appeared in response to growing protests after the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck on May 25:\nTrump and several top officials, including U.S. Attorney General William Barr, have been blaming, without evidence, antifa and other groups they call \"agitators\" for the protests that have taken over cities across the United States. Barr also said in a statement that \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\nBut the United States currently does not have a process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations, which makes Trump's ability to enforce such a designation highly unlikely.\nAntifa, short for anti-fascist, is an amorphous movement of people who are opposed to fascism. They do not comprise an organized group, do not have a visible leadership, and acknowledge that they are secretive, so it is impossible to know how many people even count themselves as members. Anti-fascists lean strongly toward the left of the political spectrum, and many of them refer to themselves as socialists, anarchists, communists, or anti-capitalists. The positions of various antifa groups can also be difficult to define, but many of them support oppressed community members and protest against amassing of wealth by corporations.\nSome antifa movements date their origins to the battle against European fascism in the 1920s and '30s. The BBC cited Mark Bray, the author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" as an authority in noting that \"[Bray] says the modern American Antifa movement began in the 1980s with a group called Anti-Racist Action. Its members confronted neo-Nazi skinheads at punk gigs in the American Midwest and elsewhere. By the early 2000s the Antifa movement was mostly dormant -- until the rise of Donald Trump and the alt-right.\"\nAntifa groups are not monolithic and employ a range of tactics. Many condemn the use of violence, but according to BBC News, some groups engage in aggressive confrontations, especially with far-right groups on the streets. Extreme factions have carried pepper spray, bricks, knives, and chains with them.\nTrump claimed members of the movement were responsible for acts of vandalism during the May and June 2020 protests against police brutality in the U.S., but in at least one case a white supremacist group was found to have posed as antifa on Twitter. Groups associated with both right and left, not just antifa, are being accused of inciting violence and looting during the protests. In most cases it is difficult to ascertain that antifa is solely responsible for the lawless activities occurring at some protests, and the culprits are still being investigated, as Keith Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, observed on NBC's \"Meet the Press\":\n\"The truth is, nobody really knows ...Theres been a lot of videotape taken by demonstrators of people who are very suspicious, who really did start breaking windows ... There have been other photographs of cars with no license plates. Very suspicious behavior.\nIt would all have to be investigated, he said.\nWithout any official structure to the group, or much evidence linking antifa to specific acts of violence, it would be difficult to prove that that body of activists is behind anything, Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security program, said: \"As far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure ... Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\"\nTrump's ability to designate anti-fascists as a terrorist group is also highly suspect given that only foreign groups can be labeled as \"terrorist\" organizations under U.S. law, and \"domestic terrorism\" is not currently a federal crime in the U.S., according to the New York Times:\nA federal law defines terrorism as crimes of violence that are intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government policy. But it distinguishes between international terrorism, which must have a foreign or transnational nexus, and domestic terrorism, which occurs primarily on American soil.\nActs of terrorism transcending national boundaries is a federal crime, giving the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors jurisdiction to take the lead. There is no equivalent crime of domestic terrorism, so law enforcement officials deal with such offenses using other laws that do not have terrorism in their labels, such as the state-level crime of murder.\nA 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) on domestic terrorism similarly stated that:\nThe federal government does not generate an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations or individuals. The development of such a list may be precluded by civil liberties concerns (i.e., inclusion in a publicly available list may impinge on a groups exercise of free speech or its other constitutionally protected activities). However, a lack of official lists or processes to designate groups or individuals as domestic terrorists makes it difficult to assess domestic terrorism trends and evaluate federal efforts to counter such threats. In 2011, an unnamed [Department of Homeland Security] official cited in a news report stated that unlike international terrorism, there are no designated domestic terrorist groups. Subsequently, all the legal actions of an identified extremist group leading up to an act of violence are constitutionally protected and not reported on by DHS.\nThe CRS report also noted that although the U.S. does not officially designate domestic terror organizations, it does record individual terrorists and threats in its Terrorist Screening Database:\nWhile the government does not provide an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does include domestic terrorists (along with international terrorists) in its Terrorist Screening Database, commonly known as the Terrorist Watchlist ...\nWhile not naming specific groups, DOJ and the FBI have openly delineated domestic terrorist threats. DOJ has identified domestic terrorism threats to include criminal activity by animal rights extremists, ecoterrorists, anarchists, antigovernment extremists such as sovereign citizens and unauthorized militias, black separatists, white supremacists, and abortion extremists.\nIn an interview with Snopes, Patel said that a number of different crimes can be designated as acts of terrorism:\nThere is no single crime of either domestic or international terrorism. But both types of terrorism can be prosecuted under a number of statutes which constitute crimes of terrorism. The crime of hijacking an airplane, for example, is an act of terrorism. In fact, the government has available 51 different criminal statutes which can be applied domestic terrorism. It does not  and should not  have the ability to designate a domestic organization. This would allow the government to target political activity as terrorism, which is exactly what the White House and the Justice Department are trying to do by threatening to go after protestors under the guise of targeting Antifa.\nThe State Department makes a list of designated \"Foreign Terrorist Organizations\" (FTO) available on their website. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), enforcing the terrorist designation for FTOs involves blocking assets, prosecuting individuals, and imposing immigration restrictions on FTOs, their members, and their supporters.\nPatel added that the Secretary of State can designate foreign terrorist groups, but this triggers a range of consequences: \"most important of which is the ability to prosecute anyone who provides the group with material support, no matter how minimal. In addition property and assets of persons linked to terrorism can be blocked, but only under a law that requires a connection to a mainly foreign threat.\"\nThus, as a large, decentralized entity with no infrastructure or assets that we know of, designating and targeting antifa as a domestic terrorist organization could, according to some experts, create a dangerous scenario, as Patel told us:\nIf persons who identified as 'Antifa' suspected of committing crimes that violate any of the federal crimes of terrorism or other criminal they could of course be properly investigated and prosecuted. The FBI has more than ample authority to investigate individuals they suspect of being engaged in criminal activity. The problem is the FBI's rules are so loose they can also investigate people who are not suspected of criminal activity, so these powers are easily abused. The FBI has a long history of investigating environmentalists and anti-war activists and recently fabricated a new terrorist threat of black identity extremists and it would be altogether surprising if they didnt spy on the protestors.\nThe paucity of evidence directly connecting antifa to acts violence during protests, combined with the structureless nature of the group and the fact that the U.S. currently has no legal process for designating domestic terrorist organizations, leads us to rate this claim as \"False.\"",

        "content": "You may have heard that federal officers in unmarked vehicles have detained people protesting against police brutality in Portland. According to some reports, officers have given no explanation for the arrests.\nWhy? One Instagram post has a theory.\n\"Here is what is going on since Trump labeled ANTIFA a terrorist organization their rights were stripped by the Patriot Act which states if someone is labeled a terrorist they are not afforded due process,\" reads the July 18 post. \"PS: Obama suspended habeas corpus too!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)\nThe Instagram post is a screenshot of a Facebook post from a comedian named Sam Tripoli. We reached out to him for a comment, but we havent heard back.\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nAntifa stands for \"anti-fascist.\" Its a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists thats been around for decades, but has had a resurgence since the election of President Donald Trump.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly blamed antifa activists for the violent protests that erupted after the death of George Floyd in late May. Theres no evidence that antifa played any significant role, but Trump said May 31 that the United States would designate the movement as a terrorist organization.\nThe post is inaccurate. Antifa is not a designated terrorist organization, and even if it were, American activists would still have due process rights.\nAntifa isnt a terrorist organization\nDespite Trumps tweet, antifa has not been designated as a terrorist organization. It is not listed on the State Departments list of foreign terrorist organizations.\nNational security experts told PolitiFact there is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. If the Trump administration did try to designate antifa as a terrorist organization, it would likely be challenged in court.\nAlso, antifa is not a structured organization  it has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups.\n\"Its a little bit like feminism,\" Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact. \"There are feminist groups just like there are antifa groups, but neither feminism nor antifa is a group.\"\nSecond: If antifa groups were designated terrorists, American activists would still have due process rights thanks to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nThe Patriot Act, which passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, does not give federal officers the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause. The legislation mainly expanded law enforcements ability to use wiretaps in counter-terrorism investigations. It was re-authorized and revised in 2015 to place limits on how much telecommunication data intelligence agencies can collect from Americans.\nWhats going on in Portland?\nIf antifa isnt a terrorist organization, then why are law enforcement officials detaining protesters in Portland? It has to do with the federal governments response to ongoing protests over police brutality.\nDemonstrators in Portland have been protesting against police brutality and racism against Black Americans since the death of George Floyd in late May. On July 14, reports surfaced that federal law enforcement agents were using unmarked cars to detain protesters in Portland. Over the next few days, videos shared on social media showed the detentions.\nFederal agents in Portland include members of the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and a unit from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. Border Patrol told CNBC that agents were deployed to Portland in support of a June 26 executive order from Trump and a new Homeland Security task force for protecting American communities.\nThe Trump administration says the officers are needed to restore peace in Portland, where protests devolved into rioting July 18. But Oregon officials and Democrats have criticized the federal governments crackdown.\nThe Oregon attorney general filed a lawsuit July 17 that alleges the federal government violated citizens rights by detaining them without probable cause. On July 19, House Democrats called for an investigation into allegations that federal officials were unlawfully arresting protesters. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley  all Democrats  have criticized the Trump administrations use of force against protesters.\nIts unclear to what extent antifa activists are among the protesters detained in Portland. The city is home to the oldest antifa cell in the country, and activists associated with the movement have been involved in recent protests there. One purported antifa activist faces charges for alleged crimes that took place during the demonstrations.\nOur ruling\nThe Instagram post claims that, since antifa is a terrorist organization, its members due process rights are stripped by the Patriot Act.\nThats wrong.\nAntifa is not an organized group and has not been designated as a terrorist organization. Even if it were, American antifa activists would still have due process rights afforded to them by the Constitution. The Patriot Act does not give federal law enforcement officials the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause.\nThe Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",

Appearing on Fox News, he described the rioters as \"Antifa-like\", but stressed it \"remains to be seen exactly how\" the peaceful protests took a sinister turn.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he had evidence that people from outside Minneapolis were involved in acts of violence in the state. He did not explain if these people were aligned with any groups or political beliefs in particular.\nOthers, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have pointed the finger at outsiders on the right wing of politics.\n\"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organised crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilise our city and our region,\" Frey tweeted on Saturday.\nHowever on Sunday, authorities in Minnesota said people from out of the state represented about 20% of Saturday's arrests.\nWhat is Antifa?\nAntifa - short for anti-fascist action - is a protest movement that strongly opposes neo-Nazis, fascism, white supremacists and racism. It is considered to be a loosely organised group of activists with no leaders.",

        "content": "As some nationwide protests have turned violent, President Donald Trump pointed to the anti-fascist movement antifa, claiming: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. But there is no such official federal designation for domestic terrorism organizations.\nExperts cited other reasons a designation  even if it were made possible  would be difficult or questionable. Antifa isnt one organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left militant anti-fascism groups.\nJames J.F. Forest, professor in the University of Massachusetts Lowells School of Criminology and Justice Studies, told us in an email. So, imagine the difficulty a prosecutor would face in a court of law proving beyond a reasonable doubt an individual was a member of ANTIFA.\nAs far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure, Faiza Patel, director of the liberty & national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told us in an interview. Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\nProtests against police brutality and racial injustice have erupted in cities across the country following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, after a Minneapolis police officer, who is white, kneeled on his neck for several minutes, as shown in a video of the arrest.\nSome of those protests have turned violent, with businesses looted and fires set. Trump, and others in the administration, have blamed antifa and the Radical Left, as Trump put it, though state and federal officials have pointed to various groups or outsiders generally. The violence and vandalism is being led by antifa and other radical left-wing groups, the president said on May 30.\nThe next day, Trump made his statement about designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\nNo Domestic Terrorist Designation\nTheres no legal process or meaning for what the president said, Patel told us. Hes reflecting on the process that we use for foreign terrorist organizations.\nThe secretary of state has the legal authority to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations under federal law. The federal government makes those FTO designations through a six-step process involving the State Department and other agencies. The designations enable the federal government to freeze assets, prosecute individuals for aiding those groups and restrict immigration for members of those groups, as the Government Accountability Office explains.\n[W]e have federal criminal statutes regarding Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, but no equivalent for domestic terrorism, Forest told us. As an example, Timothy McVeigh was prosecuted in federal court for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing under a federal law addressing weapons of mass destruction because the ideology that motivated his attack was not connected to any foreign entity.\nIf there were a domestic terrorist designation, Patel said, it would undoubtedly face a First Amendment challenge, which is likely to succeed.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service also explained in a 2017 report that the federal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations. In other words, there is no official open-source roster of domestic groups that the FBI or other federal agencies target as terrorist organizations.\nIt, too, cited concerns about infringing on First Amendment freedoms if a domestic terrorist designation were possible. Such a list might discourage speech and expression related to the ideologies underpinning the activities of named groups, the CRS report said.\nMary McCord, legal director at Georgetown University Law Centers Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former Department of Justice official, and Hina Shamsi, the American Civil Liberties Unions national security project director, made similar statements to the press. No current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns, McCord said.\nWe asked the White House about the presidents tweet but we havent received a response.\nOn the same day as Trumps statement, Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement: The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\nBarrs language isnt an official designation but could indicate the resources the Department of Justice and FBI are going to put into investigating a particular threat, Patel said. She noted that the FBI has long history of targeting protest groups and said she would be very worried that by targeting antifa, an amorphous term, the Justice Department would actually be infiltrating and targeting legitimate protest activity.\nThe CRS report said that while theres no domestic terrorist designation, the DOJ and FBI have publicly named and discussed domestic terrorism threatssuch as animal rights extremism or anarchist extremismwithout illuminating exactly how they arrive at these categories.\nForest said the court cases against those individuals relied on laws against sabotage, vandalism, harassment, et al  but not domestic terrorism. The language about such threats can also indicate what resources and priority groups would receive from the DOJ. Technically, the FBI cant really gain any law enforcement tools it didnt already have simply by calling something a terrorist threat, Forest said.\nPatel said the FBI calling a group a threat was mostly language but could also reflect what resources theyre going to devote to an issue. When we call something terrorism, she said, were suggesting its something very serious.\nAlso, Forest said there are sentencing enhancements for terrorism-related acts that could bring added prison time to a conviction.\nSome experts have argued Congress should enact a law to make domestic terrorism a federal offense.\nMcCord and Jason M. Blazakis, director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, wrote in the Lawfare blog on Feb. 27, 2019 that designation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies. But making it a crime to materially support domestic terrorism  just as its a federal crime to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization  does not raise the same concerns.\nPatel, however, has argued the opposite. After House lawmakers, spurred into action by deadly white nationalists attacks, introduced legislation to make domestic terrorism a federal crime, she wrote, in October 2019, that such a law was both unnecessary and creates serious risks of abuse.\nThe FBI already has all the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of white nationalist violence, Patel said.\nUnclear What Groups Have Incited Violence\nTrump, Barr and National Security Adviser Robert OBrien have pointed to antifa as driving or leading the violent acts that have erupted in some protests. We asked the White House if it could point to evidence of that, but we havent received a response. Various government officials have blamed different groups, or said they didnt know who was behind it.\nIn a May 30 tweet, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the city was now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.\nMark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, wrote in the Washington Post that he suspects some members of antifa groups have been involved in the protests but there arent enough of them to lead nationwide destruction tactics.\n[A]ntifa itself is not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity, Bray said.\nBased on my research into antifa groups, I believe its true that most, if not all, members do wholeheartedly support militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it this week. Im also confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance during this dramatic rebellion, he wrote. Yet it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups because members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right, and concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small. Basically, there are nowhere near enough anarchists and members of antifa groups to have accomplished such breathtaking destruction on their own.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked about Barrs statement that it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left-extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, said the truth is nobody really knows. He said on NBCs Meet the Press on May 31 that there had been very suspicious behavior, including cars with no license plates.\nIve talked to people who are demonstrating, some of them say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota. And they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it, Ellison said.\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said those cities were investigating who was responsible for the violence. Were working to get to the bottom of that right now, Carter said on CBS Face the Nation.\nIt looked differently racially in our city than our normal protests looked, Bottoms said on the same show. And it was  it was just it was a different group. So we dont know who they were, but many of them were not locally based.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that U.S. President Donald Trump (or his administration) has the legal authority to designate antifa as a terrorist organization.  Both internal and external checks strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal Check:\nThe internal check reveals a confidence score of 2, indicating low confidence. The image shows a protest with individuals carrying an antifa flag; however, it contains no mention of Donald Trump or his administration.  The absence of these key entities from the visual context weakens the claim made in the caption, suggesting a lack of direct visual support for the caption's assertion.\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check exhibits a much higher confidence score of 8, providing strong evidence against the caption's claim.  Multiple sources cited in the external check indicate that there's no legal process within the U.S. framework for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations.  This is a critical legal point that directly contradicts the caption's assertion of presidential authority to take such action. The sources consulted include statements from legal experts who question Trump's authority in this matter and factual reports confirming the lack of such legal mechanisms.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nThere is a clear discrepancy between the internal check's low confidence score and the external check's high confidence score. The internal check relies solely on the absence of visual evidence linking Trump to the antifa protest, while the external check leverages extensive legal and factual information confirming the impossibility of Trump's purported action under current U.S. law. This discrepancy is resolved by prioritizing the external check's evidence, as the external check's findings directly address the central factual claim made by the caption and its feasibility within the U.S. legal system.  The image's lack of context related to Trump is less significant than the definitive evidence establishing the legal impossibility of the action described in the caption.\n\nVisual Tampering/Miscontextualization:\nThere is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization in the image. The image accurately portrays a protest with individuals displaying an antifa flag.  The misrepresentation lies in the caption's attempt to link this visual context to a legally impossible action by the Trump administration.\n\nConclusion:\nThe combination of internal and external checks strongly indicates that the original news caption is out of context.  The external evidence, specifically the lack of legal mechanisms to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations, overwhelms the limited internal evidence gleaned from the image. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is OOC (Out Of Context) with a high confidence score of 9. The explanation carefully considers the discrepancies between internal and external checks, favoring the more robust and reliable external information pertaining to U.S. law.",

The internal check notes the absence of Trump-related entities in the image, while the external check confirms the legal impossibility of Trump's purported action.

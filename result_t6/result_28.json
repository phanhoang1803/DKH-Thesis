      "explanation": "Promobot is a real company known for producing humanoid robots.  The development of hyper-realistic skin for robots is an active area of research and development in robotics.  Vladivostok is a city in Russia. Therefore, the news caption is plausible. However,  I lack specific information to confirm Promobot's activities in Vladivostok or the exact stage of their hyper-realistic skin development.  External verification would improve confidence.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both find the caption plausible but not definitively verifiable based solely on the provided image and information.  The image shows a hyperrealistic skin mask under creation, strongly suggesting the development of advanced robotics materials.  This aligns with the caption's mention of \"hyper-realistic skin\" and \"humanoid robots.\"  The external check successfully verifies Promobot as a real company known for creating humanoid robots and confirms the existence of Vladivostok, Russia.  However, neither the internal nor external checks can confirm that this specific image depicts Promobot's work in Vladivostok or the precise stage of development shown. The absence of identifying information in the image like company logos, location markers, or a time stamp prevents definitive verification.  The visual evidence shows a close-up of the mask creation, and nothing else suggests Promobot or Vladivostok directly. This lack of clear evidence leads to uncertainty. The confidence score reflects the plausibility of the caption, balanced by the lack of concrete visual or textual evidence in the image to directly confirm the specific claims made in the news caption. Therefore, while the scenario portrayed in the caption is entirely possible and aligns with general industry trends, the image itself doesn't offer the necessary visual confirmation to conclusively verify the caption's accuracy. The OOC flag is set to true because there isn't enough visual evidence to fully support the caption's detailed claims about company, location, and precise stage of development.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal and external checks both find the caption plausible but lack definitive proof linking the image to Promobot's work in Vladivostok. The image aligns with the general concept, but specific details in the caption remain unverified due to a lack of visual identifiers within the image."

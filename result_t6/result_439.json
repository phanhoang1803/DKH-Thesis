This disinformation displays TCD's phone number and an incorrect TCD email/web address. THESE IMAGES ARE FAKED TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS. But some people believe them. TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didnt come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely. Thurston County Democrats needs your help fighting fascistic disinformation. www.ThurstonDemocrats.org. Thank you.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original news caption claims the image is a recruitment flyer for a group seeking \"professional anarchists.\"  Both internal and external validation strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal validation finds no evidence within the image itself to support the caption's assertion. The image depicts a graffiti artwork of a figure running and carrying flowers, which has no discernible connection to a recruitment flyer or anarchism.  The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this complete lack of supporting evidence within the image.\n\nExternal validation provides compelling evidence that directly contradicts the caption.  External sources confirm that images circulating online claiming to be recruitment flyers for \"professional anarchists\" are, in fact, fake and part of a disinformation campaign.  This external evidence is highly reliable, with a confidence score of 10 because it explicitly refutes the caption's claim and provides a clear explanation for the misleading imagery.  The source cited in the External Check Result corroborates this disinformation campaign, indicating a concerted effort to spread fabricated recruitment materials to discredit certain political groups.\n\nThere is no discrepancy between internal and external checks. Both unequivocally indicate that the image does not depict a recruitment flyer for \"professional anarchists.\"  The image's content is entirely unrelated to the caption's description. There is no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization; the image simply does not represent what the caption describes.  The high confidence score of 10 is justified by the combined weight of both internal and external evidence, which consistently points to the caption being entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations conclusively show the caption is false. The image contains no recruitment flyer elements, and external sources confirm the existence of a disinformation campaign involving fake recruitment flyers, directly contradicting the caption's assertion."

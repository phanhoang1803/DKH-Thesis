They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,\" Naty Gutierrez told Reuters news agency.\nA small group of protesters clashed with riot police as the peaceful rally ended.\n\"The nation has triumphed. They wanted to intimidate the people but the people are here,\" said Mr Maduro at a rally in central Caracas he said was attended by 30,000 people.\n\"We have defeated an attempted coup that tried to fill Venezuela and Caracas with violence, death,\" he said.\nIn the run-up to the march, a number of opposition politicians were detained.\nLast week, Daniel Ceballos of the opposition Popular Will party was returned to prison after having spent a year under house arrest awaiting trial on charges of rebellion.\nThe Interior Ministry said he was planning on escaping from house arrest to carry out acts of violence during Thursday's rally.\nMr Ceballos was one of the politicians arrested in 2014 over violent anti-government protests that swept through Venezuela at the time.\nForty-three people on both sides of the political divide where killed during those protests.\nPopular Will party activists Carlos Melo and Yon Goicoechea have also been arrested over the past few days, the first suspected of carrying a \"detonator cord\" and the latter of carrying explosives.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption states that the image depicts \"Government supporters at a political rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas.\"  Both internal and external validation support this assertion. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check found strong evidence supporting the caption. The image clearly shows a large crowd of people participating in a political rally.  Numerous individuals are holding flags with what appears to be the abbreviation \"UPV\" visible; while it is not explicitly stated that this signifies support for Maduro, the context of a political rally suggests a strong likelihood. The overall atmosphere of the rally suggests a unified demonstration supporting a particular political figure or party. While the image itself does not contain explicit references to \"Maduro\" or \"Caracas,\" the context of the event (a political rally) strongly implies a connection to a political leader and their supporters in a specific location.  The visual evidence aligns well with the assertion in the caption, providing a high degree of confidence in the internal validation. The confidence score of 10 from the internal check reflects this strong visual support.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation provides additional support through source corroboration.  The external source confirms that \"Mr. Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers.\" This supports the caption's central claim that the image shows a political rally for Maduro with government supporters. Although the external source doesn't directly link the image to the specific rally, its mention of large-scale rallies in support of Maduro creates a significant overlap with the caption's description. The confidence score of 8 from the external check underscores the positive supporting evidence found from this source, albeit with some level of ambiguity regarding the specific event being the same one shown in the image.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nDespite the overwhelmingly positive internal and external validation, there is a degree of uncertainty that should be acknowledged. The image does not provide explicit visual proof identifying the event's location as Caracas or directly linking the flags or symbols to Maduro's campaign or political party.  We have to rely on the contextual clues from the image (the rally's atmosphere and the political nature of the event) and the supporting information from external sources to make the connection. \n\nAddressing Discrepancies and Uncertainties:\nTo fully address the ambiguities, more information would be ideal. Access to additional photographic metadata (such as location details), or referencing more specific news reports directly correlating this particular image to a specific Maduro rally in Caracas, could significantly increase confidence. However, based on the available information, the weight of evidence strongly supports the caption's interpretation, suggesting the caption is likely accurate. \n\nOverall Assessment:\nBoth internal and external checks overwhelmingly support the caption's assertion.  The visual evidence strongly suggests a political rally in support of a likely Venezuelan political figure, fitting the context given by the caption. The external source's corroborating information of large pro-Maduro rallies reinforces the interpretation.  While some ambiguities persist (lack of explicit proof regarding location and direct association with Maduro), these uncertainties do not outweigh the strong supporting evidence. The final confidence score of 9 reflects this high likelihood of accuracy. The caption is not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's claim that the image shows government supporters at a political rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas. While some uncertainties regarding location and specific event identification exist, the weight of visual and external evidence strongly favors the caption's accuracy."

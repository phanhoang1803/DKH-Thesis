    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both strongly indicate that the original caption is completely fabricated and out of context. The internal check analyzes the image and caption, finding no connection between Katy Perry's appearance and the claim about her statement on human flesh.  The confidence score of 10 reflects this certainty. The external check uses Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, to confirm that the quote is entirely false and part of a false news report. The confidence score of 10 from the external check further strengthens the conclusion. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks, leaving no room for doubt or uncertainty.  The image shows Katy Perry at an event, and there's nothing in her expression or the image context that suggests anything related to cannibalism or the quoted statement. The visual evidence directly supports the conclusion that the caption is entirely false and out of context.  There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization.  The analysis is based solely on the image itself and the readily available evidence confirming the falsity of the news report. There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks; both consistently point towards the caption being completely fabricated and unrelated to the image. The high confidence score reflects the robust evidence supporting the conclusion. Therefore, it is definitively concluded that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm that the caption is completely fabricated and bears no relation to the image.  Snopes.com debunks the claim, and the image shows no evidence to support the claim."

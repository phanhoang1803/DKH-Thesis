        "content": "\"I stand here before you tonight, as your Congresswoman-elect, with many firsts behind my name.\"\nSupporters greeted Ilhan Omar's emotional victory speech with rapturous applause when the Democrat won Minnesota's fifth congressional district in November 2018.\nThe 37-year-old mother of three is the first Somali-American, first African-born American, and one of the first two Muslim American women to serve in the US Congress.\nMs Omar has drawn adoration and criticism since that election success as one of a new generation of young politicians shaking up the status quo in Washington DC.\nShe recently clashed with the US envoy to Venezuela, in a clip that has since gone viral.\nBut while she has won support for her approach on Capitol Hill, she has also faced repeated accusations of anti-Semitism, and even allegations of campaign finance violations in Minnesota.\nWho is Ilhan Omar?\nMs Omar was born the youngest of seven siblings in Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 1981. Her mother died when she was two years old.\nRaised by her father and grandfather, the family fled the country during the Somali Civil War and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before moving to the US in 1995.\nOriginally working in education, she began her political career managing city council campaigns and working as a senior policy aide for Minnesota politicians.\nIn 2016 she won election to the state's legislature - unseating a 44-year incumbent in the process.\nMs Omar told the BBC in a 2017 interview that young people who \"believed more in my platform, my ideas, and the merit of what I stood for\" drove her to run.\n\"A lot of the elders and mainly the women in the community thought it would be better... if I took a back seat,\" she said.\nWhat do her fans think?\n\"A refugee girl came here and achieved the American dream,\" Somali refugee Awmam Mahdi told the BBC.\n\"I think it's very positive for everyone who is an immigrant,\" the Ohio resident said, calling her a \"role model\".\nMs Omar supports policies like greater healthcare coverage, more background checks for gun buyers, and abolishing the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\nDuring her victory speech she gave a powerful rebuke to the Trump administrations immigration stance, declaring: \"Here in Minnesota, we don't only welcome immigrants - we send them to Washington\".\nThe president had previously told Minnesotans Somali immigrants there were \"spreading their extremist views\" and joining the so-called Islamic State group.\nShe drew praise for fighting to change a 181-year ban on headwear in the House of Representatives, allowing her to wear a hijab for her oath of office, and holds a place on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\nPoliticians and analysts have identified her with of a number of young Democratic politicians disrupting the status quo on Capitol Hill.\nBoth 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Palestinian-American woman Rashida Tlaib - one of the first Muslim women in Congress, alongside Ms Omar - were also elected in November 2018.\nMs Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Ms Omar after a testy exchange with US special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, went viral.\nDuring a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Ms Omar brought up Mr Abrams role in the Iran-Contra scandal, in which the US secretly sold weapons to Iran and funnelled the proceeds to Nicaraguan anti-Communist groups.\nShe also questioned Mr Abrams comments on US policy in El Salvador, including when he seemingly downplayed a massacre in the town of El Mozote in 1981.\n\"Watching her question Trump's envoy... feels like justice,\" Ms Ocasio-Cortez wrote.\nMr Abrams called the exchange \"ridiculous\" and said he would not respond to a \"personal attack\".\n\"I don't think this entire line of questioning is meant to be real questions and so I will not reply,\" he said during the hearing.\nWhat do critics say?\nBut for all her fans, Ms Omar has not had the easiest start in Washington DC.\nShe has been repeatedly embroiled in controversy over remarks critics have called anti-Semitic.\nA 2012 post of hers resurfaced in which she claimed Israel had \"hypnotised the world\", provoking outrage for what many saw as an offensive characterisation of Jewish people.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attacked Ms Omar's \"prejudicial accusations\" and demanded an immediate apology.\nShe later did so, tweeting a statement saying she had colleagues \"educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes\".\nBut the controversy continued when Ms Omar, speaking at a Washington DC event in March, questioned what she termed \"the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country\" - in reference to pro-Israel lobbying.\nPeople from both parties again criticised the remarks, saying they played on anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish Americans having divided loyalties - though Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren all spoke out in her defence amid the furore.\nMr Sanders in a statement said people should not \"equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel\".\nPresident Trump has called on her to resign from Congress and \"certainly\" from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, calling the congresswoman \"terrible\".\nMs Omar wrote a tweet in response, saying: \"You have trafficked in hate your whole life\".\n\"I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you?\"\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

    "explanation": "The internal check finds the image accurately depicts Bernie Sanders and Rashida Tlaib together, but it cannot verify the caption's claim about Tlaib being a \"radical anti-Semite.\" This claim is subjective and not visually evident. The external check reveals a discrepancy. While sources confirm both individuals' existence and their involvement in political activities,  there is no corroborating evidence to support the claim that they held a press gathering to promote a shared vision for America, especially one framed with the controversial label. The confidence score is low because the visual evidence only confirms the presence of the individuals; it does not support the politically charged statement about their joint intentions.  The discrepancy lies in the caption's assertion of a shared political agenda and the description of Rep. Tlaib, neither of which is supported by the image itself or readily available external sources. The image alone shows two individuals together; the caption adds a highly charged interpretation unsupported by visual evidence or readily accessible external verification.  Therefore, given the lack of external validation for the key aspects of the caption (the joint press conference to promote a specific vision, and the characterization of Rep. Tlaib), it's judged to be out of context. Visual evidence is limited to the co-presence of the two individuals. The external search produced results relevant to both figures but did not independently verify the claim in the caption, further reducing the confidence score. The internal validation only confirms visual elements; it doesn't validate the subjective and contentious claims embedded in the news caption.  This absence of corroborative information outside of the caption and the limitations of the image itself contribute to a low confidence score and a classification of \"out of context.\"",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of Sanders and Tlaib but cannot verify the subjective and controversial claims in the caption. External check fails to corroborate the key assertions of the caption, particularly regarding the nature of their meeting and the characterization of Rep. Tlaib. The significant discrepancy between visual evidence and the caption's claims results in a conclusion of 'out of context'."

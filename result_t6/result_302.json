Working title is 8 Mile 2 and it will be about my life after I came up and will follow basically my whole career. Im really looking forward to seeing this movie with yall and I hope you like it as much as Ive liked filming it.\nSurprisingly, the flick is being directed by none other than Clint Eastwood, a man you dont normally think of when you think of rap. Eastwood had his own comments about the upcoming film:\nThis movie was a big challenge for me, not only because of the subject matter, but also because its hard to dramatize a mans entire career like we set out to do. Nevertheless I am very pleased with how things are going and I think were really coming up with a multi-dimensional, well rounded story about Eminems career, both the bright and the dark parts.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence that the image and caption are consistent, as the image depicts Eminem, the central figure of the movie \"8 Mile,\" and the caption discusses a sequel to the film. However, the external validation check reveals a significant discrepancy.  External sources, such as Snopes, explicitly deny the existence of an \"8 Mile\" sequel slated for release in 2016 or at any point in the future. This external evidence directly contradicts the caption's claim. The high confidence score from the internal check stems from the apparent alignment of the image and caption's subject matter.  The low confidence score of the external check is based on the definitive statements from reliable sources refuting the claim. Given the strong external evidence that refutes the caption, and the lack of any supporting evidence for the sequel's existence, we must conclude the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The visual element only supports the subject of the movie, not the claim of a sequel's release. The discrepancy lies in the factual inaccuracy of the caption's claim regarding the sequel's release date. There is no visual misrepresentation or tampering; the image is accurate.  However, the contextual information provided by the caption is definitively false according to reliable external sources.  The fact that an Eminem biopic exists is not in question; the inaccuracy lies in the sequel's purported release.  Because external evidence definitively contradicts the caption's claim,  the caption is judged to be out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows a strong correlation between the image and caption's subject matter. However, external validation definitively refutes the caption's claim about the \"8 Mile\" sequel, making the caption out of context."

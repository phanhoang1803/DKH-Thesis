        "date": "2018-06-04T07:44:42",
        "content": "Claim:\nThe National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a quiet admission that marijuana kills cancer:\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe report in question is the NCIs Physician Data Query (PDQ) on Cannabis and Cannabinoids. The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as marijuana kills cancer.\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the overview section:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells  including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet admission of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added quietly in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ prove that cannabis kills cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not prove anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be cured by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has no currently accepted medical use, which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Governments official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal governments center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI admitted that cannabis kills cancer uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way prove that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes directly addresses the PoliticusUSA article mentioned in the news caption.  Snopes confirms the article's claim that an NIH document update included a \"quiet\" admission that marijuana \"kills cancer\" is false.  Snopes details how the PoliticusUSA article misinterpreted existing information in the NIH's Physician Data Query (PDQ) on \"Cannabis and Cannabinoids\", showing that the cited information did not change significantly and that pre-clinical studies mentioned in the PDQ do not prove marijuana kills cancer in humans.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes article directly refutes the claim made in the PoliticusUSA article, stating that the claim is false and providing detailed evidence from the NIH document in question to show that the information was misinterpreted and did not amount to an admission that marijuana kills cancer.  The Snopes article also highlights the limitations of the cited pre-clinical studies and the absence of conclusive evidence of marijuana's effectiveness as a cancer treatment in humans.",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that an August 2015 PoliticusUSA article reported that an update to a National Institutes of Health (NIH) document quietly admitted that marijuana \"kills cancer.\"  The image, however, only shows marijuana in a prescription bottle next to a stethoscope. There is no mention of PoliticusUSA, the NIH, or any claim about marijuana curing cancer. Therefore, the image is not related to the specific claim made in the caption. The internal check correctly identifies this mismatch, scoring zero confidence because the image lacks the entities mentioned in the caption.  The external check, referencing Snopes, strengthens this assessment. Snopes directly addresses the PoliticusUSA article and definitively debunks its claim about marijuana killing cancer, confirming that the article misinterpreted information in the NIH's Physician Data Query (PDQ). This external verification corroborates the internal finding that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong agreement between the internal analysis (which found no visual evidence connecting the image to the claim) and the external fact-checking (which demonstrated the falsity of the claim itself). There is no visual tampering or miscontextualization evident in the image; the image simply depicts marijuana and a medical instrument, without any contextual elements that would link it to the specific claim in the PoliticusUSA article. The absence of such elements further reinforces the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The internal check's low confidence score reflects the lack of direct textual evidence in the image, while the external check's high confidence score stems from Snopes's thorough investigation and refutation of the original claim. The disagreement in confidence scores isn't a conflict; rather, they reflect different aspects of the evaluation. The internal check assesses the image's direct relevance to the caption, while the external check evaluates the truthfulness of the claim in the caption.  Both checks independently support the final conclusion: that the caption is out of context with respect to the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the image is out of context with respect to the news caption.  The image contains no elements related to the PoliticusUSA article or the NIH claim, and the claim itself is false according to Snopes."

        "content": "A police officer and a civilian have been killed in the Nigerian city of Lagos as protests continue against police brutality for a sixth day.\nThere are reports that police used live ammunition on the protesters in the country's largest city.\nThis comes a day after a notorious police unit accused of unlawful arrests and murder was officially disbanded.\nDemonstrators have long called for the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars) to be broken up.\nBut they remain unhappy following Sunday's announcement that officers are being redeployed to other units rather than being disciplined.\nEyewitnesses say there were multiple casualties among protesters after police opened fire on them in the Surulere area of Lagos on Monday, the BBC's Ishaq Khalid reports from the capital, Abuja.\nSome of the demonstrators reportedly threw stones at the police. The police say one officer was killed and two others were critically injured by what they called ''armed protesters''.\nMeanwhile, Lagos police and protesters blame each other for the death of a 55-year-old man.\nAn aide to President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the use of live bullets on demonstrators by the police. There are reports that armed trucks have been deployed to Lagos airport to break up protests blocking access to the airport.\nEarlier, the president promised \"extensive\" police reforms and said Sars officers responsible for human rights violations would be brought to justice.\nBut the latest alleged use of live bullets by the police on protesters could further anger campaigners and lend more credence to their grievances, our correspondent says.\nIn Monday's video address, President Buhari said disbanding Sars was \"only the first step\" in a range of reforms, but added that police officers were hard-working, and the reputation of the force should not be tarnished by a \"few bad eggs\".\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose accept and continue.\nThere are also fears that if thousands of Sars officers were dismissed at once, they could pose a security threat.\nActivists say the abuses carried out during the protests - including beatings, intimidation and the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators - were all carried out by policemen who did not belong to Sars.\nThey say a total overhaul of policing in Nigeria is needed.\nOver the weekend, protests against Sars spread to Europe and Canada after reports of unlawful arrests, torture and shootings.\nWhat do the protesters want?\n#EndSARS campaigners have circulated a list of five key demands to bring about reform. These are:\nThe immediate release of all arrested protesters\nJustice for those killed by police brutality and compensation for their families\nAn independent body to investigate and prosecute misconduct\nIndependent psychological assessments and new training for dismissed Sars officers who want redeployment\nA pay rise for police so they are \"adequately compensated for protecting lives and property of citizens\"\nHow did Sars operate?\nThe latest round of protests were prompted by footage of officers pulling two men out of a hotel in Lagos into the street and shooting one of them.\nThe footage, leaked to the media, provoked outrage and led many to share stories of brutality attributed to the unit, which has developed notoriety for unduly profiling young people, the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja says.\nThose considered \"flashy\" often attract the Sars officers' attention and very few walk away without having to hand over money, while others are arrested or jailed on trumped-up charges and some have been killed, our correspondent adds.\nEarlier this year, rights group Amnesty said it had documented at least 82 cases of torture, ill treatment and extra-judicial execution between January 2017 and May this year.\nThe victims were mainly men aged between 18 and 35 from poor backgrounds and vulnerable groups. Many of those tortured were beaten with sticks and machetes and denied medical attention, the group said.\nThe \"systemic use of torture... points to an absolute disregard for international human rights laws and standards\", Amnesty said.\nWhy didn't reform work?\nThe #EndSARS hashtag was first thought to have been used in 2018, but it emerged once again a week ago.\nDecember 2017: Outcry prompts Nigeria's then-police chief, Ibrahim Idris, to order an immediate re-organisation of the anti-robbery unit in the aftermath of a viral video showing a young man allegedly killed by police\nAugust 2018: Acting President Yemi Osinbajo orders an overhaul of Sars, wanting a new unit whose officers would wear proper identification while on duty. He also asks the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria to create a special panel to investigate previous wrongdoing by Sars\nJanuary 2019: Newly appointed Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu announces a comprehensive reform of Sars and temporarily decentralises the unit. Rights group Amnesty says the reforms do not go far enough for citizens to trust the police\nFebruary 2020: Police boss Mohammed Adamu gives instructions to disband Sars' satellite offices",

    "explanation": "The original news caption states that protesters blocked a road leading to the airport in Lagos on October 12th.  The internal check found strong visual evidence supporting this claim. The image clearly shows a protest occurring at a location identified as an \"Airport Access Plaza.\"  The presence of numerous protesters, signs, and a woman addressing the crowd strongly suggests a protest is underway at what seems to be an airport access point. The mention of \"Lagos\" in the caption is supported by the visual context, although the image itself does not explicitly state Lagos.  The external check further bolsters the claim.  While not explicitly stating October 12th,  the external source mentions news reports about protests blocking access to the Lagos airport, which is consistent with the image's contents and the caption's overall meaning.  The timeframe is consistent and reinforces the image.  Although the external source doesn't pinpoint the exact date, the corroborating news reports about protests impacting airport access in Lagos significantly increases the confidence level.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both suggest the caption is a reasonably accurate reflection of the events depicted in the image, despite the lack of specific date corroboration in the external source. The confidence score reflects this minor gap in date confirmation but emphasizes the substantial agreement between visual evidence, internal analysis, and external reporting.  Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is not out of context is strongly supported by the evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's claim of a protest blocking access to Lagos Airport, although the external source lacks the precise date mentioned in the caption. Visual evidence strongly suggests an airport access point, and the news reports corroborate the overall event described."

        "content": "SUEZ, Egypt (AP)  Salvage teams on Monday finally freed the colossal container ship stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal, ending a crisis that had clogged one of the worlds most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.\nA flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of the skyscraper-sized Ever Given from the canals sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged since March 23.\nThe tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule.\nWe pulled it off! said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired to extract the Ever Given. I am excited to announce that our team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated the Ever Given  thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again.\nNavigation in the canal resumed at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT, noon EDT) said Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal Authority, adding that the first ships that were moving carried livestock. From the city of Suez, ships stacked with containers could be seen exiting the canal into the Red Sea.\nAt least 113 of over 420 vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed are expected to cross the canal by Tuesday morning, Rabei added at a news conference.\nAnalysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end.\nThe Ever Given sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, for inspection, said Evergreen Marine Corp., a Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship.\nBuffeted by a sandstorm, the Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That created a massive traffic jam that held up $9 billion a day in global trade and strained supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic.\nRabei said an investigation would determine why the Ever Given got stuck, and he estimated daily losses to the canal of between $12 million to $15 million.\nThe Suez Canal is not guilty of what happened. We are the ones who suffered damage. he said.\nAt least 367 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, had backed up to wait to traverse the canal. Dozens of others have taken the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africas southern tip  a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.\nThe canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Mondays events after days of silence about the blockage.\nEgyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis, he wrote on Facebook, despite the massive technical complexity.\nIn the village of Amer, which overlooks the canal, residents cheered as the vessel moved along. Many scrambled to get a closer look while others mockingly waved goodbye to the departing ship from their fields of clover\nMission accomplished, villager Abdalla Ramadan said. The whole world is relieved.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Cairo tweeted its congratulations to Egypt.\nThe breakthrough followed days of immense effort with an elite salvage team from the Netherlands. Tugboats pushed and pulled to budge the behemoth from the shore, their work buoyed by high tide at dawn Monday that led to the vessels partial refloating. Specialized dredgers dug out the stern and vacuumed sand and mud from beneath the bow.\nThe operation was extremely delicate. While the Ever Given was stuck, the rising and falling tides put stress on the vessel, which is 400 meters (a quarter mile) long, raising concerns it could crack.\nRabei praised the team, saying they achieved a very difficult mission in record time, without damaging the vessel or its cargo.\nBerdowski told Dutch radio station NPO 1 the company had always believed it would be the two powerful tugboats it sent that would free the ship. Mondays strong tide helped push the ship at the top while we pulled at the bottom and luckily it shot free, he said.\nWe were helped enormously by the strong falling tide we had this afternoon. In effect, you have the forces of nature pushing hard with you and they pushed harder than the two sea tugs could pull, Berdowski added.\nThe crew on the tugs was euphoric, but there also was a tense moment when the huge ship was floating free so then you have to get it under control very quickly with the tugs around it so that it doesnt push itself back into the other side of the canal, he said.\nJubilant workers on a tugboat sailing with the Ever Given chanted, Mashhour, No. 1, referring to the dredger that worked around the vessel. The dredger is named for Mashhour Ahmed Mashhour, assigned to run the canal with others when it was nationalized in 1956 by President Gamal Abdel-Nasser.\nOnce the Ever Given is inspected in Great Bitter Lake, officials will decide whether the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship hauling goods from Asia to Europe would continue to its original destination of Rotterdam or head to another port for repairs.\nThe crisis cast a spotlight on the vital trade route that carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the worlds oil. Over 19,000 ships ferrying Chinese-made consumer goods and millions of barrels of oil and liquified natural gas flow through the artery from the Middle East and Asia to Europe and North America.\nThe unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, has prompted new questions about the shipping industry, an on-demand supplier for a world under pressure from the pandemic.\nWeve gone to this fragile, just-in-time shipping that we saw absolutely break down in the beginning of COVID, said Capt. John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com. We used to have big, fat warehouses in all the countries where the factories pulled supplies.  Now these floating ships are the warehouse.\nInternational trade expert Jeffrey Bergstrand predicted only a minor and transitory effect on prices of U.S. imports.\nSince most of the imports blocked over the last week are heading to Europe, U.S. consumers will likely see little effect on prices of U.S. imports, except to the extent that intermediate products of U.S. final goods are made in Europe, said Bergstrand, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dames Mendoza College of Business.\n__\nDeBre reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The program does not operate in real time, and includes satellite, aerial, 3D and street view images that are collected over time from various providers and platforms.\n\"The mosaic of satellite and aerial photographs you can see in Google Maps and Google Earth is sourced from many different providers, including state agencies, geological survey organizations and commercial imagery providers,\" Matt Manolides, a satellite imagery expert at Google, said in a company blog post. \"These images are taken on different dates and under different lighting and weather conditions.\"\nThe inconsistency in the water color of the Suez Canal is due to a difference of day-to-day lighting conditions and camera angles, and a similar effect can be seen at other locations on Google Earth.\nFor example, the first image shared in the post has a moderate amount of surface reflection, making it look blue, and waves can be seen in it. The third image has a high amount of surface reflection and is brighter than the first image due to more sun reflecting back up to the satellite.\nThe artifacts are sometimes produced when Google Earth stitches satellite images together. They normally aren't so noticeable, but satellite imagery of water can sometimes make stitching more visible, according to Google.\nOther places that show a similar effect include the Panama Canal, Straits of Gibraltar and Loch Ness.\nWe rate this post False.",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis was not a staged event. The Evergreen Line is the trade name for the five shipping companies owned by the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan shipping conglomerate. An Ever Given ship, one of the largest ocean vessels in the world, got stuck in a bank of the canal on March 23 during a dust storm with high winds.\nWhile a six-day blockage along the maritime route is rare, groundings are the most common cause of shipping incidents in the canal, with 25 in the past 10 years, according to global business insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE.\nThe strong winds are widely seen as a major factor in this incident. But the Washington Post reported that the Suez Canal Authority said the investigation will not focus just on the weather, and that human and technical errors cannot be ruled out.\nThe incident received around-the-clock news coverage by countless media organizations all over the world and efforts to free the ship involved many people and dozens of organizations.\nThe Evergreen Line released updates as the grounding situation unfolded, and on March 25 said it would \"continue to coordinate with the shipowner and Suez Canal Authority to deal with the situation with the utmost urgency, ensuring the resumption of the voyage as soon as possible and to mitigate the effects of the incident.\"\nCrews used tugboats, large-capacity dredgers and high tides to excavate and pull the ship from the canals banks. The vessel was freed by around-the-clock digging (workers removed approximately 30,000 cubic meters of sand) and tugs that pushed and pulled it into the middle of the channel.\nEver Givens owner and insurers could face claims for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage was disrupted, insurers and brokers told Reuters.\nWe rate this post False.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows a high confidence (score of 10) that the image depicts the Ever Given cargo ship. The name is clearly visible on the hull, and the ship's appearance matches descriptions readily available online. However, there is some uncertainty about the location; while it appears to be a canal, it's not definitively identified as the Suez Canal. The external check, on the other hand, reveals a significant discrepancy.  It casts serious doubt on the caption's claim that the ship is \"stuck again.\"  The external sources consulted provide no evidence of a second grounding incident after the initial Suez Canal blockage.  The external check yields a very low confidence score (2) because of this contradiction. The low score also reflects that the provided text focuses on the initial grounding and does not reflect the image's current state.  The discrepancy between the high internal confidence and low external confidence highlights a critical issue: while the image shows the Ever Given, the caption's statement about it being stuck again lacks support from external sources. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context because it conveys false information about a subsequent grounding event that is not corroborated by verifiable sources. The overall confidence score is low (3) because, while the image itself is accurately identified, the caption's key claim is incorrect. The image does not show the ship stuck, hence the statement in the caption is false. The overall assessment favors the external validation findings due to the absence of any credible evidence supporting the caption's claim of a second grounding incident, particularly given the readily available information about the Ever Given's release from the Suez Canal. The image might simply show the vessel in a different location at a later time, unrelated to any second incident.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the identification of the ship but is uncertain about the location. External check refutes the caption's claim of a second grounding incident, resulting in a low overall confidence and an 'out of context' designation."

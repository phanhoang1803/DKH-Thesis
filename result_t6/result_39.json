It was founded six years after that.\nAny iOS device with a 64 bit processor will be affected.\nSo the iPhone 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus, the iPad Air 2, the iPad Mini 3 and 4, and the sixth-generation iPod Touch.",

        "content": "Claim:\nSetting your Apple device's date to 1 January 1970 will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.\nIn February 2016, a rumor began to spread that iPhones and iPads contain a nifty Easter egg: If you set the date of your Apple product to 1 January 1970 then reboot, it will bring up a retro-themed menu based on the old Apple computer operating systems.\nText on the image read:\nBlast from the past\nThe original Macintosh introduced the world to computers, forever changing the way people experience technology, and allowing people to do things that were never possible before. With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, its a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phones date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablets operating system that youll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so theres not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, its possible  at least in theory  that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says its looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check correctly identifies that the image shows an iPhone with the date set to January 1, 1970, aligning with the caption's claim. However, the external validation check strongly contradicts the caption's claim. Two sources explicitly state that setting the date to January 1, 1970, does not result in a retro-themed Easter egg, but rather can damage the device. This significant disagreement necessitates a careful evaluation. The internal validation's confidence score of 10 reflects a strong alignment between the image and caption, solely based on visual content.  However, the low external validation confidence score of 2, stemming from two independent sources debunking the claim, dramatically diminishes the overall confidence. The external sources provide strong evidence that the claim is a hoax or misinformation. While the image shows the date being set as stated in the caption, the caption's implication of a retro Easter egg is fundamentally incorrect according to reliable external information. Considering the weight of evidence from reputable sources, the caption is out of context, despite the visual consistency.  The visual evidence alone cannot outweigh the clear consensus from external sources indicating the caption's assertion about the Easter egg is false.  There is no visual indication of a retro theme in the image, which further supports the external validation findings.  Therefore, the final assessment concludes that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows a strong visual match between the image and caption.  However, external validation from two independent sources conclusively refutes the caption's claim regarding a retro-themed Easter egg, indicating it's a hoax. The external evidence outweighs the internal visual analysis, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

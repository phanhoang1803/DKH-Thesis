    "explanation": "The internal validation gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows a girl on a high-rise glass floor in Bangkok, using what looks like eclipse glasses. The location matches the King Power Mahanakhon building. However, the external validation completely contradicts this, stating there is no supporting evidence and assigning a very low confidence score (1). The external check claims that the evidence retrieved discusses a different subject (walking during the COVID-19 pandemic), bearing no relation to the caption's description of a solar eclipse observation.  This significant discrepancy needs careful consideration. While the internal visual analysis strongly suggests the caption's accuracy, the lack of corroborating external evidence raises serious doubts.  The absence of any external source supporting the described event weakens the overall credibility. There's no information about a solar eclipse event in Bangkok on the date suggested in the image, further undermining the external validation.  The image itself, while internally consistent, is insufficient to conclusively prove the caption's accuracy without additional evidence. Consequently, a low confidence score is assigned, and 'OOC' is set to 'true' due to the unresolved contradiction between internal visual analysis and the failure of external validation to provide support. The image might be authentic, but the context provided in the original caption cannot be fully verified.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation finds no supporting evidence, resulting in a significant contradiction. The lack of external corroboration leads to a low confidence score and 'OOC' set to true."

Its hard to determine precisely where its going to hit, but it will almost certainly be in North America.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is directly contradicted by the provided evidence.  Snopes explicitly debunks the claim that a Nazi missile launched in 1944 was headed for the American Midwest in late December 2016. The fact-check article states that while NASA did announce a potential for a V-3 rocket to land in North America, it was not aimed at the U.S. and the original claim is false.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The provided image shows several missiles silhouetted against a sunset.  There is no information within the image itself to support the claim made in the caption. The internal validation check correctly identifies this lack of evidence, assigning a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False. The external validation check strengthens this assessment by referencing a Snopes fact-check that directly refutes the claim.  Snopes provides strong evidence that the news caption's assertion – regarding a Nazi missile launched in 1944 landing in the American Midwest in 2016 – is false. This external source corroborates the internal assessment and significantly increases confidence in the conclusion. There is no visual evidence to support the claim and external evidence directly refutes it.  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably out of context with the provided image. The high confidence score reflects the combined strength of the internal and external validation, both of which point towards the inaccuracy of the caption in relation to the image.  The image is simply a picture of missiles; there is nothing in the image that would link it to the specific claim in the news caption.  Further, there are no visual inconsistencies or signs of manipulation; the image appears to be a genuine photograph of missiles. The discrepancy between the image content and the caption's narrative is absolute. The internal validation's lack of confidence is perfectly justified by the visual evidence. The external validation provides conclusive evidence to refute the claim.  There is no ambiguity or room for doubt; the news caption is entirely unconnected to the image. The details within the image are completely unrelated to the specific events and objects mentioned in the news caption. The factual information about the news claim provided by the external source (Snopes) completely invalidates the news caption's assertion about the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks conclusively demonstrate that the news caption is out of context with the provided image. The internal check highlights the absence of supporting evidence within the image, while the external check cites a Snopes fact-check that definitively refutes the claim in the caption."

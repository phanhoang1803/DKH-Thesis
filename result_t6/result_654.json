        "content": "Claim:\nBackless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016.\nIn November 2016, an image macro appeared bearing the unsourced claim that \"backless booster\" seats would be illegal starting in December 2016, and quickly made the usual rounds on social media. It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the visual consistency of the image with the caption's description of a child in a car seat.  It correctly points out that the image aligns with the subject matter but cannot verify the specific legal claim about the date of a regulatory change.  The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image itself is relevant to the topic of child car seats. However, the external check, utilizing a Snopes fact-check, is crucial. It demonstrates that the claim about the illegality of backless booster seats for children under 12 from December 2016 is false. This external verification carries significant weight, as it directly addresses the core assertion of the caption. The discrepancy highlights the limitation of relying solely on visual evidence for claims involving specific dates and legal regulations. The image shows a child in a car seat, but it doesn't provide any information about the legality of the seat type or the date of any potential legal changes. The high confidence score from the internal check is outweighed by the definitive evidence from the external check, which reveals the caption's claim to be inaccurate.  Therefore, based on the external fact-check, the caption is indeed out of context. The caption, while not visually misleading, is factually incorrect and presents information that is not supported by verifiable legal changes.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation finds visual consistency but cannot verify the legal claim. External validation (Snopes) definitively proves the legal claim in the caption is false.  The caption is out of context due to factual inaccuracy."

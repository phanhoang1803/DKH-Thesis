A new Arena film from BAFTA and Emmy award winning director Adam Low celebrates the life and long career of one of our most loved playwrights. Part reflection on the ageing process, part remembrance of the joys of youth, Alan is aided by the films he has written and the documentaries he has presented in his quest to understand the person he has become.\nAttitudes to (and laws about) homosexuality have been transformed in Alans lifetime, and his work has played a small but significant part in affecting this change. Prick Up Your Ears, The History Boys, and The Habit of Art have all dealt with it in different ways  as well as signalling his own gradual openness.\nAs a teenager Alan was sent to Cambridge where he was one of a small group of conscripts studying Russian as part of their military service. This led to a fascination with the Cambridge spies Philby, Burgess, Maclean and Blunt, and the hysteria and hypocrisy surrounding their discovery. An Englishman Abroad is based on the actress Coral Brownes encounter with Guy Burgess in Moscow in 1958. In A Question of Attribution, his play about Anthony Blunt, who became the Keeper of the Queens Pictures, Elizabeth II as a character appeared on stage for the very first time.\nNo longer able to handle his ancient old bike, in the film Alan rides around his neighbourhood on a tricycle. He still goes for local strolls with Rupert to get the paper and sits outside his beloved Primrose Hill Community Library. Regular trips to their cottage in Yorkshire and writing on his old Corona portable typewriter also feature in this entertaining and intimate portrait.\nAlan Bennett 90 Years On is a Lone Star Productions production (1x60) for BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.

We reveal that the character of Roger Moore  the manner, the charisma, and self-deprecating humour  was his own creation and it took him to the height of fame and a jet-set lifestyle counting Frank Sinatra, Gregory Peck and David Niven amongst his close pals.\nHis three children from his thirty-year relationship with Italian actress and wife number three Luisa Mattioli share never before seen home movie footage of the family and showbiz friends enjoying life in Switzerland and the South of France.

She was a cover star with a thirst for the high-life and the looks of a supermodel. She dominated opera until disaster struck  she fell in love with Aristotle Onassis, and when he left her for Jackie Kennedy her life fell apart.\nBut this tragic legend of Maria Callas isnt true: Callas was nobodys victim. She was defiant, exacting - a woman who blazed a trail for female artists of today. But there was one thing that mattered more to her than anything - her astonishing, life-changing voice. It was gradually failing her. And she knew it.\nAt her peak in the 1950s Callas averaged 50 appearances a year. But between 1959 and 1963 she sang in public only 28 times. She cancelled performances, earning her an (undeserved) reputation as an erratic diva. This film is, in part, a detective story: what was it that made Maria Callas lose her voice?\nThis Arena film is also a celebration of Callas - her brilliance, originality and determination to be the greatest opera singer alive. A stellar cast of experts and admirers uncover the truth about her and the gift of her extraordinary voice. Her impact on classical music was revolutionary, bringing forgotten roles into the limelight and making them her own: magnificent, indomitable heroines. Callas is the artist who reminded the world what opera is for.\nMaria Callas: The Final Act is a Swan Films production (1x60) for BBC Two and BBC iPlayer. It was commissioned by BBC Arts.

    "explanation": "The internal validation shows some confidence (confidence score of 8) in the caption's accuracy because the image depicts a man sledding downhill in a snowy environment, which aligns with the general description of the caption. However, the lack of external validation (confidence score of 0) significantly weakens the overall assessment. The external check explicitly states that there is no evidence supporting the claim about the man sledding on Primrose Hill in London in any available source. This discrepancy indicates a significant issue with the caption's accuracy.  The internal validation's reliance on plausibility, rather than concrete evidence, is insufficient to counter the absence of external verification. There's no visual evidence to confirm the location as Primrose Hill. The image only depicts a man sledding down a snowy hill, which could be anywhere. Thus, while the image itself is consistent with the general description in the caption (man sledding), the specific location detail is not verifiable, making the caption out of context. Given the substantial disagreement between internal and external checks, and the lack of strong evidence to support the claim about Primrose Hill, the confidence score is very low. It is important to note that absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence, but in this case, combined with the weak internal validation, it points towards a miscaptioned image or a caption that is not well-supported.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption by identifying the man sledding, but the external check fails to corroborate the specified location (Primrose Hill, London). This discrepancy, combined with the lack of explicit visual clues confirming the location, leads to a low confidence score and an out-of-context conclusion."

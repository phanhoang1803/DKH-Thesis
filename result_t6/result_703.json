        "content": "Keeping an Eye on the Pink Iguana\nThe recent eruption of the Galapagos Islands tallest volcano left Gabriel Gentile breathlessly waiting for news. How was the pinky, he wondered. Would spewing gases and ash endanger the last surviving pink iguanas, a species Dr. Gentile, an evolutionary zoologist, is largely responsible for putting on the biological map?\nSo far, the roughly 200 pink iguanas, which live only on the northern slope of Wolf volcano on Isabela Island, seem O.K. Maybe thats to be expected of a species thats clung to survival in exceedingly harsh terrain, is at least a million years old and has until recently evaded the gaze of humans.\nPink iguanas were first seen by park rangers in 1986, but were considered flukish rose-colored variants of the much more numerous yellow iguanas until Dr. Gentile and his colleagues determined otherwise in 2009. He said Conolophus marthae (named in memory of Martha, Dr. Gentiles stillborn daughter) is genetically, morphologically and behaviorally different enough to be its own species, and is the earliest of the three Galapagos land iguana species to split from their reptilian ancestor.\nHow Wolf volcano, only about 350,000 years old, became their outpost is one of many mysteries. We are talking about a very old lineage that occurs on one of the youngest islands of the archipelago, said Dr. Gentile, whose home base is the University of Rome Tor Vergata.\nThe color of chewed bubblegum, spangled with some blackish stripes, pink iguanas are smaller than yellow ones and have different crests and different nodding behavior. They are threatened by nonnative feral cats and parasites, by limited genetic diversity, and by the fact that there are fewer females than males. Not all females are fertile, and those that are produce fewer eggs than yellow iguanas.\nAfter Wolfs eruption, rangers sent Dr. Gentile blood samples from five pink iguanas, which he will test for elevated levels of stress hormone. This year, he plans to outfit several iguanas with tiny GPS trackers to study them better.\nOne theory why so few remain is that being pink may cause some damage, he said, exposing them more dangerously to ultraviolet radiation. I dont think being pink is an advantage.\nPAM BELLUCK\nMore Posts\nThe End\nThanks for joining us this summer as we wandered into the deep sea, visited Pluto, barbecued steak on lava, read the worlds oldest message in a bottle and took the first bite of space salad.\nAlong with exploring why sometimes the big toe is not the biggest, we learned that:\nThe New Horizons spacecraft was going so fast that it passed the moon in just nine hours.\nIts possible to run a computer on water droplets.\nA leap second means 80 extra wing flaps for a hummingbird.\nSome elephants respond to the rumba, but not the tango.\nThere is a type of shark that is small enough to hold in your hand.\nThe United States looks like a checkerboard from above because of Thomas Jefferson.\nThe first flower did not appear on Earth until after the dinosaurs had arrived.\nB.M.I. is misleading about 18 percent of the time.\nYou can find more fascinating New York Times science stories, year round, here as well as on our Facebook page and our Twitter feed.

Many die from swallowing the plastic.\nThe problem received some national attention in 2013 with the documentary Midway, which showed a remote island in the Pacific covered in corpses of baby albatross. Their exposed innards revealed lighters, bottle caps and toothbrushes mistakenly fed to them by their parents.\nThe number of incidents like these is rapidly increasing, according to the new study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers from Australia and Britain analyzed a number of papers from 1962 to 2012 that had surveyed 135 seabirds. The team found that fewer than 10 percent of seabirds had traces of plastic in their stomachs during the 1970s and 1980s. They estimated that today that number has increased to about 90 percent of seabirds. And they predict that 99 percent of all seabirds will swallow plastic in 2050.\nFor Erik Van Sebille, an oceanographer at Imperial College London and co-author of the paper, the most surprising findings from their analysis were the locations where seabirds were most likely to ingest plastic.\nResearchers had previously thought that giant garbage patches swirling between Hawaii and California were the most likely places where birds would eat the waste. Instead, most seabirds are ingesting plastic at hotspots that stretch from Australia and New Zealand to South Africa and Chile.\nBoris Worm, a marine biologist from Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who was not involved in the research, said that seabird deaths are the most visible sign of a larger threat that plastics pose to marine wildlife like fish, whales and sea turtles.\nIts an indicator that our world is literally getting clogged by plastic, he said.\nThe studys authors suggest stricter regulations on plastic production, consumption and disposal, as well as the development of plastics that degrade in seawater.\nGlobal plastic production has doubled every 11 years since the 1950s and currently tops 300 million tons per year. Currently more than seven million tons of plastic trash end up in the ocean, often a result of improper dumping into rivers that wash into the sea.\nNICHOLAS ST. FLEUR\nA Deep Sea Worm\nThis polychaete worm, just under eight inches long, was found three miles down during the deepest dive ever made in the Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument, a conservation area in the Hawaiian Archipelago.\nThe Okeanos Explorer, a ship which belongs to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is surveying the waters of the monument and other areas in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and using a remotely operated vehicle e and other technology to map and document the life and environment of the deep ocean there.\nJAMES GORMAN\nWhats That Science Thing: Puffin Power Edition\nThis tool allows users to do something that many people can do without a second thought.\nWhich of these is made possible by the device pictured?\nA. Cracking an egg.\nB. Taking a selfie.\nC. Threading a needle.\nD. Steadying a moving video camera.\nClick for the answer!\nThe correct answer is B.\nThis mouth-operated joystick called the Puffin is made for people who cant use their arms or hands. It allows them to check email, send texts and post the selfie they just took to Instagram. By manipulating the joystick with their mouths, users can maneuver a selector on a mobile device like a smartphone; a simple pressure system capable of detecting both length and intensity registers sharp inhalations and exhalations as input  accomplishing the same thing as a person using his or her fingers to tap out a text.\nThe sip-and-puff technology underlying the Puffin  which requires users to suck air out of or blow air into a mouthpiece  has helped people with mobility impairments for more than 50 years. But its not enough to be able to flick a light switch on or off in the era of smartphones.\nTheres nothing really for mobile devices, and thats what this is really about, said Adriana Mallozzi, an accessibility advocate who has cerebral palsy and consulted with four M.I.T. students who built the device. In Ms. Mallozzis experience, other sip-and-puff accommodations  nearly all of them intended for stationary use  are far too limiting.\nTheyre very large and clunky and cost too much to travel with, she said of similar devices, some of which can cost more than a thousand dollars. By contrast, the Puffin prototype was assembled from materials that cost less than $200 and was able to be configured to the precise specifications of Ms. Mallozzis powerchair.\nMs. Mallozzi and her team devised their Puffin prototype during a hackathon intended to spur innovation in assistive technologies. Other submissions included a motorized turntable to spread cream cheese on a bagel without the use of hands and a hands-free walker.LOUIS LUCERO II\nA Name That Tune That May Help Dementia Patients\nIts a Name That Tune-type game with a twist, one that its creators hope to eventually use to help dementia patients. The game, a citizen science project called Hooked On Music, tests how quickly people can recognize snippets of the 200 top pop songs in Britain since the 1940s.\nLast year, scientists in the Netherlands who created the game reported that, based on the recognition speed of about 12,000 people, the catchiest single was Wannabe by the Spice Girls. And the catchiest part? Not the Ill tell you what I want, what I really, really want part or the zigazig ah part, but the If you wanna be my lover part. When the song started at that point, a typical player guessed it in 2.29 seconds.\nMambo No. 5 was the second catchiest, with players recognizing it 2.48 seconds after Lou Bega sings the part about Monica, Erica, Rita and Tina. And Eye of the Tiger by Survivor was recognized in 2.62 seconds after players heard the subtle hint of the line, Its the eye of the tiger.\nJohn Ashley Burgoyne, a computational musicologist at the University of Amsterdam who created the game with colleagues, said their analysis found that three things made a song especially memorable: a repetitive melody (like the fourth catchiest song, Lady Gagas Just Dance), melodic conventionality (SOS by Abba  fifth), and a prominent vocal (Roy Orbisons Pretty Woman  sixth).\nBut the researchers are not just interested in what makes a musical hook. Dr. Burgoyne, a Maine native who trained as a classical singer, wants to use it to find songs that can prompt memories for people with dementia. Often, dementia patients can recognize songs, especially from their youth, and playing familiar music can soothe them or stir other recollections. To gather data toward that goal, a new version of Hooked on Music was unveiled last week and will be featured this fall at Britains Manchester Science Festival, which is partly supporting the research. The new game tunes itself to you, Dr. Burgoyne said, by responding to participants guesses and sending them more songs like the ones they are better at recognizing.\nTo play, click yes the instant you recognize, say, Macarena. Then the track goes silent for 4 seconds, during which youre supposed to hum or sing the tune out loud or to yourself. As in an earlier version, when the song returns, youre asked if it picked up at the right spot or not. If youre correct, you get credit for recognizing the song. The updated game deconstructs players skill at recognizing songs that emphasize melody, bass line or rhythm. People better at rhythm-centered music will eventually get two-thirds of their snippets from songs with strong rhythms, Dr. Burgoyne said.\nIf we can get this model calibrated in a healthy population, then we can translate it to a dementia population, he said. He says he envisions the program creating, with a caregivers help, a list of songs that are going to be most recognizable for this patient.\nOne other change in the new version: the playlist no longer includes the Beatles Symphony Orchestra. People really didnt like it, Dr. Burgoyne said. We got complaints.\nPAM BELLUCK\nTheres Still Time to Dig Up a Dinosaur This Summer\nWe were kids. It was summer. And the shovels were bigger than our bodies. We carried the shovels to my backyard with nave confidence and endless energy. My siblings and I were certain that our North Carolina backyard had once housed hundreds, probably thousands of dinosaurs. Every chance we had, we dug. And when we didnt find anything, we dug deeper. Our excavations resulted in quartz crystals and a moratorium on digging after my father drove his riding lawn mower into a hole for the umpteenth time.\nWe never found a single bone, which makes sense. In the United States, some of the areas where paleontologists have had the most luck finding dinosaurs are eastern Montana, western North Dakota, northern Wyoming and northeastern New Mexico. In April a 5-year-old helped dig up a dinosaur behind a grocery store in Texas. And Utahs Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument has been the site of thousands of dinosaur fossils, including a tyrannosaur found last summer. Except for the aetosaur, a prehistoric reptile that is not technically a dinosaur, bone remnants of the ancient creatures have not been found in North Carolina.\nTheyre not in Illinois either, where Stephen L. Brusatte, now a paleontologist at University of Edinburgh, spent his childhood digging for bones. Dr. Brusatte has uncovered dinosaurs in Portugal, Poland, Romania, New Mexico and most recently China, where he was part of a team that dug up a winged cousin of the velociraptor. On behalf of all dino-crazed kids out there, I asked Brusatte for tips.\nDinosaurs are always in fossilized rocks, so first find the right rocks. The right rocks were formed where dinosaurs lived  in rivers, lakes or sand dunes  230 million to 66 million years ago during the Mesozoic era. The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and the United States Geological Survey provides maps and papers that describe these rocks and their locations. But if youre willing to settle for less than a dinosaur, The Fossil Guy offers some suggested locations.\nLeave that fancy radar you saw in Jurassic Park at home. Once youve picked a spot, its down to patience, perseverance, good eyesight and plain old good luck, Dr. Brusatte said.\nThe magical spot is likely where others have found hints of dinosaurs, but no one ever looked carefully, he said. Geologists field notes can sometimes be treasure maps for dino bones. In 2009, a German geology students notes from a mapping project led Dr. Brusatte and his colleagues to a mass graveyard of car-size amphibians in the Algarve of Portugal.\nJOANNA KLEIN\nIn the unlikely occasion that you do find a dinosaur bone or a comparably intriguing fossil, we expect you to send us a photograph of your treasure at summerofscience@nytimes.com or tag it #nytscience on Instagram.\nAn earlier version of this post misstated the group of scientists who study dinosaurs. They are paleontologists, not archaeologists.\nThe World's Oldest Message in a Bottle\nIt took a century, but the message finally reached its destination.\nMarianne Winkler, a retired post office worker, discovered a peculiar bottle in April while vacationing with her husband on Amrum Island in Germany.\nInside the dusty glass tube was a piece of paper with the words Break the bottle, inscribed in bold red type according to The Telegraph.\nWhen Ms. Winkler opened it, she discovered that the tiny bottle was a remnant of an ocean experiment conducted more than a hundred years ago. The message included a return address for George Parker Bidder from the Marine Biological Association in Britain.\nFrom 1904 to 1906, Mr. Bidder performed an experiment to observe ocean currents, according to the association. The message found by Ms. Winkler was one of 1,020 weighted bottom bottles that Mr. Bidder scattered across the southern part of the North Sea, which borders Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Mr. Bidder planned to investigate how currents moved in the depths of the sea.\nPeople who reeled up the bottles were enticed to record their location and return the information to Mr. Bidder for a reward of one shilling. More than half of his weighted bottles found their way back within four years. But a few hundred are still missing, possibly adrift in the ocean.\nWe think this bottle was one of the last batch he sent out, in 1906, so that would make it 108 years old, Guy Baker, from the Marine Biological Association told The Telegraph. If true, such an estimate would make Ms. Winklers find the oldest message in a bottle ever recovered, dethroning a 99-year old artifact released in 1914 and found in 2013.\nIn keeping with Mr. Bidders promise, the association rewarded Ms. Winklers historic find with a shilling.\nNICHOLAS ST. FLEUR\nIn These Photos, You Can Actually See a Bees Knees\nThe scientist who took these photographs calls himself a bee hairdresser.\nIts not enough to put an insect under a microscope and snap away. He has found that its necessary to comb it and flick away bits of dust or pollen that might prevent an observer from seeing facets that could be crucial to distinguishing one bee species from another. Depending on how old his deceased specimen is, he might need to rehydrate it.\nBut Sam Droege doesnt mind working with such a select clientele. The biologist, who heads the Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Program of the United States Geological Survey, says he has artistic tendencies, but its about more than making pretty pictures. He set out to improve upon the tools available to scientists who were trying to identify bees they found in the wild. And he took many of these photographs in the process, and subsequently posted them on what became a popular Flickr page.\nBird watchers have it so easy, he said of studying bees. The number of species involved, we really know very, very little, and one reason is we cant identify what they are.\nThe photographs from that Flickr page have been published in a book, Bees: An Up-Close Look at Pollinators Around the World.\nMany of the bees engage in behaviors one might not expect from creatures mainly thought of as sociable pollinators or honey-makers that might sting you. Take the Giant Resin Bee. This species from Asia doesnt build its own nests. If it cant find an abandoned one, it will seize a home from another species. It doesnt fight fair, dumping resin it gathers on its victims so they cant fly and fight back.\nAnother species, the polysocial hairy tongue, illustrates how many assumptions about bees can be confounded by nature. When it lives in warmer climates, it will congregate with other bees and live in groups. But when the species lives in colder, mountainous regions, Mr. Droege writes, its happy alone.\nWith bees facing many threats, Mr. Droege says he wants people to better appreciate their diversity.\nDespite all our human cleverness, we still owe a lot to these bugs, he says. Look how beautiful they are!\nMICHAEL ROSTON\nWant to make your own photographs of bees and other insects? Mr. Droege explains how in this tutorial.\nThis is What Piercing the Sound Barrier Looks Like\nExceeding speeds of 760 miles per hour, supersonic jets pierce the sound barrier with a resounding \"BOOM!\"\nNow, NASA researchers have captured high-resolution images of the shock waves that generate the thunderous moment. They released the new images earlier this week.\nScientists from NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center and Ames Research Center used a 150-year old technique called schlieren photography to reveal how air flowed around the jet as it blasted through the sky.\nThe German physicist August Toepler developed schlieren photography around 1864. Today, the technique has captured everything from gas emanating from a burning match to germs spewing from a persons cough.\nTo take this supersonic shot, NASA pilots flew a jet thousands of feet beneath a second airplane equipped with a high-speed camera. The second plane caught the moment that the jet exceeded Mach 1, the speed of sound.\nBy using special software, the researchers eliminated the desert background, enabling the usually invisible shock waves, vortices and engine plume to emerge. The researchers said that they hope these images will help them improve designs for future supersonic flights.\nNICHOLAS ST. FLEUR\nYou Too Can Build a Computer That Works Drop by Drop\nWant to build a water computer?\nNot one run on hydroelectric power. And not the kind of computer you use to post to Facebook or write email.\nNo. This is the simplest kind of computer, a machine that can perform logical actions because of built-in rules.\nFor instance, if \"a\" happens, then \"c\" happens. If \"a\" and \"b\" happen, then \"c\" must not happen.\nIn this computer a, b and c are movements of water droplets only microns in diameter. These droplets, which contain magnetic nanoparticles, zip around a minuscule grid that looks as if it is made of flat Lego pieces. The grid is magnetized, and its design creates the logical rules of movement for the droplets, which float in an oil film.\nManu Prakash and his colleagues at Stanford University built such a computer and are inviting designs for more.\nThe point of the construction, originally detailed in Nature Physics, is not to find a new way to solve math problems but to build a new way to move matter around. The water droplets can carry drugs or nanomaterials. According to the design of the computer, the droplets could sort themselves out, combine, even organize into structures. This kind of computer could lead to a new world of manufacturing.\nHis website is not for the faint of mind. But if you have the nerd cred, or simply the ambition to plunge into a new world (complete with tutorials), go for it.\nThere are tutorials. You can download software to design your own water computer. His team will post your design on their site.\nAnd, if they like the design, they'll build it.\nJAMES GORMAN\nThe Sea Lions Smooth Moves\nTo Megan Leftwich, California sea lions are some of the oceans most fascinating acrobats.\nWhile large fish swim by wiggling their tail fins from side to side, and many marine mammals move with exaggerated up-and-down strokes of their tails, sea lions swim by using the front flippers to thrust the body forward smoothly through the water.\nThis allows them to glide, spin and perform underwater barrel rolls, without creating much disturbance behind them. Its a quality that makes them unparalleled stealth swimmers  and prime targets for researchers looking to make covert underwater robots.\nDr. Leftwich, who studies fluid dynamics at George Washington University, noticed this peculiar propulsion system one day while watching the marine mammals at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington. Intrigued by the mathematics behind this motion, she and her team set out to investigate what happens to the water as sea lions swim through it.\nOver the course of two years they recorded more than a hundred hours of video so that they could deconstruct the movements of the sea lion's foreflippers frame by frame. The team also took high-resolution laser scans of a foreflipper from a sea lion carcass; they published that work this month in The Journal of Aero Aqua Bio-mechanisms.\nUsing the data and the 3-D computer models, they mapped individual points on the sea lions flipper onto a digital foreflipper, and then observed its motion in a simulation.\nThey then mathematically decoded how the sea lion moves: First the animal collects water in its foreflippers, and then quickly scoops the water in toward its body. Then it claps its flippers against its torso, pushing the water toward its rear flippers and propelling it forward in a glide.\nBy generating thrust with their foreflippers in a jetlike motion, they are using a different paradigm of swimming from really any other type of swimmer, Dr. Leftwich said. The only animal that comes close to doing what the sea lion does would be a human doing the breaststroke, according to Dr. Leftwich.\nThe team has used that information to 3-D print a robotic foreflipper in hopes of finding out more about the sea lions stealthy strokes.\nNICHOLAS ST. FLEUR\nThe Most Comprehensive Map of the Deep Seafloor Yet\nThis may look like the set of a Claymation video, but it is actually a still shot of a new digital map revealing the composition of our ocean floor. Based on this color bar, you can imagine what walking on the bottom of the ocean might be like  sandy, muddy, rocky and full of fragmented shells and corals.\nScientists at the University of Sydneys School of Geosciences and National Information and Communications Technology Australia research center used around 15,000 samples of seafloor sediments to create the map. Its one of the most notable records of our planets mysterious land beneath the sea since the cartographer Marie Tharp drew her map by hand in the 1970s.\nBefore Ms. Tharp, many thought the ocean floor was just a relatively flat bed of mud. But together with her colleague, Bruce Heezen, Ms. Tharp discovered a rift in the mid-Atlantic Ridge and changed the theories of continental drift. Spinning todays interactive map shows an ocean blanketed in clay (brown) and a layer of skeletal debris called calcareous ooze (light blue).\nScientists hope that the map of seafloor components, like remnants of once living sea creatures, will help them to better understand how climate change affects the ocean.\nJOANNA KLEIN\nHow Often Is B.M.I. Misleading?\nWe were struck by the massive response to our post on how its possible for individuals to have the same B.M.I. but very different bodies.\nReaders told us about their muscles, and about being overweight according to B.M.I. though their body fat percentage was low and their body type was similar to person three. Some wondered for how many people B.M.I. is an incorrect indicator.\nAbout 18 percent, says data from the Centers for Disease Control. As part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the agency surveyed body fat levels of over 5,000 people across the country about 10 years ago. Along with measuring peoples height and weight, researchers used a special type of density-measuring X-ray called a DXA scan to measure body fat percentage.\nAs you can see in the graphics here, there was a strong relationship between B.M.I. and body fat percentage, but for almost one in five adults, the two measurements disagreed. Eleven percent who were overweight according to B.M.I. had normal body fat. They are potentially some of the healthy obese. More troubling, 31 percent who were of normal weight according to B.M.I. had excess body fat. They could be called skinny fat. Excess was considered to be a body fat percentage over 25 percent for men and over 35 percent for women. Women were more likely than men to be in the normal B.M.I. range but have high levels of body fat.\nB.M.I. is commonly used to classify people as overweight or obese because its components, height and weight, are much easier to directly measure than body fat percentage. Affordable and convenient methods of measuring body fat are inaccurate, and more precise tools like a DXA scan are expensive and inconvenient.\nThe consequence is that some perfectly healthy high-B.M.I. people might be unnecessarily worried about their weight or penalized by higher insurance premiums. And some normal-B.M.I. people may be fatter than they realize and facing the same health risks as the obese.  ALBERT SUN\nIf the vultures continue to disappear, can you imagine? This whole beautiful place will become one stink pit.\n\nAnthony Ole Tira, co-owner of the Matira Bush Camp in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve, on the decline of Pan-African vultures.\nParting Curtains of Dust, and Finding Black Holes\nThough they are millions to billions of times the mass of our sun and gobble every stray star, planet and wisp of dust that wanders by, supermassive black holes are rather shy types.\nThey are thought to exist in most if not all large galaxies, but they typically hide behind clouds of gas and dust, hampering efforts to better understand them.\nThis summer, however, a group of astronomers at Durham University in England reported that they had used NASAs Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, to detect five supermassive black holes rapidly engulfing matter at the center of their galaxies. Although the team had hypothesized that there were undetected black holes existing in particularly dark and dusty galaxies within our universe, the proof was nonexistent  until NuSTAR came along.\nLaunched in 2012 and controlled by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, NuSTAR is an orbiting telescope with the ability to detect the highest-energy X-rays emitted by active black holes  including ones hidden by dust so thick that previous satellite observatories could not cut through. The team pointed the telescope at these nine galaxies suspected of harboring black holes based on previous observations from other telescopes. NuSTAR confirmed that five of them indeed housed active black holes at their centers. The team speculates that black holes in the other four are hidden even deeper behind gas and dust.\nTheir finding lends support to the notion that the universe may contain millions of supermassive black holes that are hidden from view.\nThe astronomers, led by George Lansbury, presented their findings at the Royal Astronomical Societys national meeting last month in Wales. The Astrophysics Journal has accepted their paper for publication.\nIn its three years of operation, NuStar has proven to be a game changer in black hole research, Dr. Lansbury said by email. \"The next stage would be to hunt for more of these hidden black holes,\" he said. And sure enough, his team is currently \"exploring new ways to select target galaxies for NuSTAR.\nThe future of black holes is bright, friends.\nASHAKI LLOYD\nAfter a Century of Study, Scientists Conclude This Plant Is a Flower\nSome 470 million years ago, a clump of algae made the jump out of the water to become the first land plant, something that resembled the modern-day liverworts.\nMore than 300 million years later, there were no flowers. Dinosaurs were walking the Earth before the blooms of the first flowering plants appeared, probably 140 million to 150 million years ago.\nScientists have yet to find fossils of the first flowers. (Without hard pieces like shells and bones, plants are less likely than animals to be preserved.)\nBut now paleobiologists have Montsechia, which lived at least 125 million years ago, putting it in the running for the oldest known flower.\nIt is an odd flower, because it lived fully submerged in water. The evolutionary innovation of flowers was that colorful petals attracted insects to spread the pollen, and pollinating insects do not swim.\nBut Montsechia used water currents rather than insects to spread its pollen.\n\"Now we see that extremely early in the evolution of flowering plants, they moved into the water, even before we have good records of more complex type flowers,\" said David L. Dilcher, an emeritus professor of geological sciences at Indiana University and an author of a new paper describing Montsechia published last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe species itself is not a recent discovery, first unearthed in limestones in Spain more than a century ago, and biologists have tussled for decades over what kind of plant it is.\nOver the past decade and a half, scientists led by Bernard Gomez of the Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 in France collected hundreds of specimens, painstakingly dissolving away the surrounding rock with hydrochloric acid, drop by drop.\nThat enabled them to identify fruits  the defining characteristic of flowering plants, or more technically, angiosperms.\n\"Its quite a unique and interesting system,\" Dr. Dilcher said. \"It focuses our attention on the idea that flowering plants were extremely inventive.\"\nKENNETH CHANG\nThe parents are not out to sabotage their kids.

But for Kathryn Harrold, it's the gruesome sights on the side of the road that catch her eye: squished squirrels, raccoon carcasses, opossums pulverized into the pavement.\nMs. Harrold, who works as a marketing manager for a real estate agency near the I-280, spends some mornings and evenings before and after work volunteering with the California Roadkill Observation System, a project that documents dead animals struck by vehicles along the state's highways.\nWhenever she spots roadkill, she pulls over to the shoulder, throws on her bright orange safety vest and steps out of her car. Then she snaps a picture in hopes that the grisly photo will eventually help prevent similar incidents.\nThe animals are literally split into different pieces and torn in half all over the road, Ms. Harrold said. The blood splatters are morbidly breathtaking. Its awful.\nThere are more than 1,000 wildlife-vehicle accidents reported each year according to the California Department of Transportation and the California Highway Patrol statistics. Since 1994, at least 110 of them have been fatal for humans as well.\nFraser Shilling, co-director of the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis, started CROS in 2009 as a way to track the roadkill that he saw every day while driving. In six years the project has grown into a statewide database with nearly 32,000 entries mapped, and 5,000 images captured by more than a thousand volunteers.\nWith about 3,600 entries, raccoons top the road kill list, followed by skunks and deer.

FLEUR\nEven When You Go Off the Grid, You Might Still Be On It\nLooking from the window seat on a long plane flight, you might have noticed that large swaths of the United States are divided into a latticework of farms, towns and forests. The cells of that grid, each one mile to a side, are the visible result of a land planning system first proposed by Thomas Jefferson more than two centuries ago.\nThe images here, taken from the Instagram account @the.jefferson.grid show just a few of the landscapes that can be squeezed into the one-mile squares. The account's curator, who prefers to remain anonymous, uses Google Earth to find interesting blocks across the country.\nForests, the boundaries of small towns, and farmers center-pivot irrigation systems all submit to the grids relentless logic. Thin gray and white streets trace the squares, often signaling where one property ends and another begins.\nThe idea behind this sprawling checkerboard emerged after the Revolutionary War. As the United States expanded westward, the country needed a systematic way to divide its newly acquired lands. The original colonies were surveyed using the British system of metes and bounds, with parcels delineated using local geography and cataloged with riveting language:\nBeginning at corner No. 1, a hemlock post, 4 in. square, 24 in. above ground, located on the Takotna Highway about 1/4 mile southeasterly from its intersection with the left bank of Kuskokwim River\nThat approach doesnt scale very well, and Jefferson, an ambitious politician who would become president about two decades later, was made chairman of a committee to find an alternative. He proposed to slice the young United States into gridded plots of land that would support his ideal country of yeoman farmers who would form the backbone of American democracy.\nJefferson's idea became a reality in 1785 when it was enacted as the Public Land Survey System. Today his grid covers much of the country, and it is still used to survey federal lands  an idea that shaped the physical landscape of half a continent.\nDEREK WATKINS\nWorld Will Not End Next Month, NASA Says\nAn Internet rumor that a large space rock is going to slam into Earth next month gained enough traction that NASA on Wednesday put out a statement denying that the world is about to end.\nAs the apocalypse story has it, the asteroid impact would occur between Sept. 15 and Sept. 28 near Puerto Rico.\nIn the NASA release, Paul Chodas, manager of the Near-Earth Object office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said, There is no scientific basis  not one shred of evidence  that an asteroid or any other celestial object will impact Earth on those dates.\nThe danger of a collision with any of the known asteroids over the next century is less than one in 10,000, the space agency said.\nThis is not the first time a story of impending doom from outer space has circulated on the Internet, but this one persisted long enough to garner NASA attention.\nWeve still been getting calls and getting emails, and September is coming up, said D. C. Agle, a spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

FLEUR\nSometimes the Answer Is to Build a Vomit Machine\nSpontaneous beach days aside, one of the most likely reasons your coworker contracted the elusive 24-hour bug was because she caught a stomach virus known as the norovirus.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 20 million Americans catch norovirus every year. And of those who become sick, only about 5 million get infected from eating contaminated food, according to Dr. Lee-Ann Jaykus from North Carolina State University. The majority of cases, she said, come from people catching the virus from other infected people.\nSince vomiting  particularly projectile vomiting  is a hallmark symptom of a norovirus infection, Dr. Jaykus decided to investigate how vomit could spread the disease. She suspected that after someone throws up, virus particles could be aerosolized, or released into the air.\nIn order to demonstrate that in the lab, Dr. Jaykus and her team constructed their own vomit machine made out of tubes, pumps and valves with a clay face.\nThey loaded the machines stomach with fake vomit, and added pudding to make it chunky. Then they mixed in a virus called MS2, which is similar to norovirus but much less dangerous. The machine was locked into a Plexiglas chamber to puke its mechanical brains out.\nWhile testing the machine the team turned to Youtube for insight into how people throwup.\nWe scanned the Internet. Youd be amazed at how many vomiting incidents there are, Dr. Jaykus said. One fact they found was that people tend to cough a few times after throwing up, a feature they added to one of their simulations.\nUsing a biosensor the researchers found that in all cases the vomit did spew viral particles into the air and that the amount of viral particles increased when the machine ejected with more pressure. The coughs also increased the amount of virus particles in the air. The team published their findings Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.\nThe experiment found that only 0.00007 percent to 0.03 percent of the vomits volume could be aerosolized, which translated to between approximately 40 and 10,000 virus particles.\nAlthough that may seem infinitesimal, Dr. Jaykus said that those amounts are actually quite significant because it only takes between 20 and 1,300 norovirus particles to infect someone.\nThat equates to a lot, a lot, a lot of potential illness that could arise from just that single vomiting event, she said.\nNICHOLAS ST.

If you missed the show, Thursday and Friday's should be similarly stellar. And while you should feel free to call them shooting stars, just remember that's not what they truly are.\nDennis Overbye described a meteor shower this way in 2002: \"As the Earth plows into that cloud, crumbs of matter left behind by the comet scream into the atmosphere and die a breathtaking death.\"\nEarlier this week Summer of Science offered a short guide to Perseid meteor shower, which coincides with the new moon on Friday. Andy Newman also offered watching tips specifically for New Yorkers.\nTracking a Rare Nautilus in Papua New Guinea\nThis is an Allonautilus scrobiculatus, a rare cousin of the nautilus that was the namesake of Captain Nemos submarine in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Earlier this summer it and three of its friends had radio transmitters epoxied to their shells so that a group of researchers could follow the little critters as they migrated between Ndrova and Manus, a pair of islands in Papua New Guinea.\nPeter Ward, a paleontologist at the University of Washington and the leader of the team, discovered the allonautilus back in 1984 with his colleague Bruce Saunders. Though it may resemble the better known chambered nautilus worn on necklaces, it was so different in shell and soft part anatomy that it was eventually proclaimed not just a new species, but a wholly new genus: Allonautilus.\nBut then several decades passed without a definitive sighting and Dr. Saunders began to fear that Allonautilus had gone extinct.\nWhen Dr. Ward returned to Papua New Guinea this summer, he found they are still there  but not all that easy to track. He and his crew of helpers spent the summer trying to stay above the nautilus in a canoe because the radio transmitter on its back only had a range of about 3,000 feet. As a result the Allonautilus, which inhabits depths of 300 to 1,000 feet, kept giving them the slip, Dr. Ward complained.\nI have all the appreciation possible for submarine hunters sitting in ships above, he wrote in an email.\nBut his concerns about the fate of the Allonautilus persist.\nThe possible bad news, Dr. Ward reported by email, is that their habitat, this part of Papua New Guinea where uniquely in the world two genera of nautiloid cephalopods live, is slated soon for large scale deep water mining that will dredge the seafloor, a seafloor above which these ancient survivors still live. But for how long?\nDENNIS OVERBYE\nLooking at Humans as Super Predators\nThe outrage following the killing of Cecil the lion by an American hunter last month was a stark reminder of a role that humans hold in nature: top predator.\nWe hunt not just lions and tigers, but also bears, wolves, deer and elk. We fish tuna, seabass, swordfish and salmon. We kill for food and sport.\nBut heres a what if?: What if humans were considered as just another predator within the global ecosystem, rather than apart from it? How do our predatory habits compare with those of other top carnivores like lions, bears and sharks?\nThose are the questions that Chris Darimont, a conservation scientist at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, set out to investigate. He and his colleagues wanted to put global hunting into context and quantify the impact of human predation.\nThe team combed through more than 300 research papers and constructed a database with more than 2,000 instances of human and nonhuman hunting and fishing. The biggest difference they found is that humans overwhelmingly kill adult prey while carnivores tend to hunt juveniles, for the simple reason that they are easier to kill.\nThis could be because humans prefer large trophies. You will not hear a fisherman brag about the smallest fish of the day, Dr. Darimont said.\nThe team also reported that commercial fisheries caught adult fish like cod and tuna at 14 times the rate that natural marine predators did. On land, humans and animal predators hunted herbivores like moose and deer at similar rates, but people killed large predators like bears and wolves at nine times the rate that these carnivores killed each other.\nDr. Darimont and his colleagues concluded that humans are super predators that hunt prey at unsustainable rates. They published their research Thursday in the journal Science.\nNICHOLAS ST.

He and his colleagues reported their findings in the journal Current Biology.\nWhistled Turkish is used to communicate over long distances in the mountainous terrain of northeastern Turkey. Dr. Gntrkn administered a standard listening test to subjects who rely on whistling. Different speech sounds were delivered simultaneously to the right and left ears of each subject.\nWhen listening to fragments of spoken Turkish, the subjects more often heard the sounds played to the right ear. Thats because the brains left hemisphere receives input from the bodys right side and processes speech, Dr. Gntrkn said.\nBut the subjects picked up whistled Turkish equally well in either ear. The pattern of 50-50 tells us that indeed the physical format of a language alters the way the brain processes it, Dr. Gntrkn said.\nThe whistled language may be used by 10,000 to 50,000 people today, said Dr. Gntrkn, a native speaker of Turkish.\nSINDYA N. BHANOO\nExploring the Science Behind Differing Marijuana Highs\nWalk into any marijuana dispensary in California or Washington State, and prepare to be overwhelmed by the choices. Growers have cultivated hundreds of strains, and retailers often sell dozens purporting to have particular medical or recreational properties.\nIn truth, scientists are still struggling to understand how marijuana affects individual users, as this video explains. The main psychoactive ingredient, THC, induces the high experienced by users, but other chemical compounds in the plant may influence it, a phenomenon some experts call the entourage effect.\nAs a result of this factor and several others, its difficult to predict a particular strains effect on a particular individual  but that probably won't stop the marketing efforts in the growing marijuana industry.\nAXEL GERDAU\nThe Stinging Spaghetti Monster of the Deep Sea\nOff the coast of Angola, an unmanned submarine patrolling a BP oil well some 4,000 feet down recently recorded video of this guy lurking along the sea floor. Up on the surface, the BP team nicknamed it a Flying Spaghetti Monster.\nTo find out its real name, they turned to the Serpent Project, a group of marine biologists that works with the oil industry to explore the deep sea and conduct environmental assessments. The companies use video and photography to quickly scout large swaths of the sea floor, and intriguing creatures are sometime caught on camera in the process.\nDaniel Jones, a marine biologist, was the first on Serpents team to receive the video. At first, he said, we werent sure what kind of species it was.\nThe Serpent team, with the help of a colleague, Phillip Pugh, concluded it was a Bathyphysa conifer. (That is pronounced bath-ee-fye-sah kohn-iff-er  like the trees  according to the American Museum of Natural History.)\nBathyphysa conifer is very closely related to the Portuguese Man O'War, and shares its venomous sting. Similarly, it pulses its body to move around in the water, but it does not have the strength to swim against ocean currents.\nAccording to Dr. Jones, Bathyphysa conifer was first described in 1878 after German trawlers snared one in their net. They are believed to live in both the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, but since they live at great depths they are rarely seen. When they are brought to the surface, theyre often in tatters because their bodies are very fragile.\nSimilar to corals and sponges, this Bathyphysa conifer is actually a whole colony of different individuals. In the video, you can see a large bulb at the top of the creature, which acts as a float. Just below it is a series of thick, relatively stubby feeding structures. These are just \"developing\" but further down, there's a skirt of longer, more mature feeding structures with thin stinging tentacles that are used to catch prey. Each feeding structure is a member of the colony and they all have to be clustered together for the Bathyphysa to survive.\nEMILY HAGER\nIn fact, the giant panda is a bear, and this is the only panda.\n\nAngela Glatston, an expert on red pandas, the adorable mammals that are threatened by habitat loss and climate change.\nA Teensy Black Hole, Just 200,000 Miles Wide\nFor a monster its pretty cute.\nBuried in a smush of stars known as RGG 118  and noticeable only by a plaintive squeal of X-ray radiation  astronomers have discovered a new black hole. By the standards of normal life its not so small, a pit in space-time 200,000 miles across into which the equivalent of 50,000 suns have disappeared. But on a cosmic scale its not so big.\nAlmost every galaxy, like the Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole millions or billions of times as massive as the sun sitting at it center. The bigger the galaxy, the more massive the black monster at its heart. Nobody knows why.\nThe new black hole is the first one found in a dwarf galaxy. RGG 118, as it is elegantly named, is 340 million light-years away and about a hundredth the mass of our own Milky Way, whose central black hole weighs some 4 million suns.\nA team from the University of Michigan and Princeton, led by Vivienne Baldassarre, a Michigan graduate student, found and measured it by using NASAs Chandra X-Ray Observatory and an optical telescope in Chile to chart the speeds of stars and gas swirling around in the small galaxy.\nObserving the behavior of such a teensy, so to speak, black hole, Ms. Baldassare and her colleagues hope, will help them understand where the monstrous black holes found in regular galaxies come from and how they grow so big. Some astronomers speculate that they are seeded from giant clouds of primordial gas, or the collapse of gargantuan stars that inhabited the dawn of time, and then grew by merging with other black holes as galaxies collided during the rough and tumble days of the early universe.\nThe RGG 118 black hole is like finding a preteenager on the verge of all this. In the fullness of cosmic time, it could grow into a true monster.\nDENNIS OVERBYE\nI used the gorilla training method.

In fact, the Columbia University researchers who designed it had to have it custom-built.\nWhat is the potential use of this device?\nA. Zapping tumors without surgery\nB. Keeping an eye on Mordor\nC. Reflecting and collecting solar energy for storage\nD. Making your subwoofers obsolete\nClick for the answer!\nThe correct answer is A.\nWhat you are looking at is actually a combination of two devices, assembled into an imaging system developed by Professor Elisa Konofagou and her team. The orange face in the center is an imaging probe and the outer ring, studded with exactly 93 small, circular elements (I counted), is a transducer. That second component  a high-intensity focused ultrasound phased array transducer, if were being technical  could one day assist in the elimination of tumors without surgery. Developing those capabilities would be a particular boon for cancer patients who have tumors that were judged too risky for surgical intervention because of where they are located. Another welcome side-effect: reducing the need for radiation.\nLike all ultrasound technology, this device uses targeted sound waves to generate an image. But unlike other uses of ultrasound, this tool could help doctors assess the elasticity of body tissues. In this approach, called harmonic motion imaging, tissue is probed with pulses of acoustic energy that are slightly greater than standard ultrasound and observed for its physical response.\nBecause cancer tissue is known to be, on average, stiffer than healthy tissue, any discrepancies between the observed and expected elasticity that are identified through the imaging process can indicate the presence of a tumor.\nAccording to Yang Han, a Ph.D. student with the group, using a 93-element transducer instead of a more common single-element transducer allows researchers to direct the beam of ultrasonic energy, providing greater control when targeting tissues.\nAlthough the array is currently being used only for research, the team sees an opportunity for therapeutic applications down the road. As Professor Konofagou explained in an interview with Columbia Engineering magazine, the same basic technology used to image tumors might be able to destroy them  no scalpel required.\nExactly the same transducer, exactly the same system, generates thermal effects in the tissue, so it can burn the tissue at higher intensities, she said. Noninvasively, remotely, where you need it.\nLOUIS LUCERO II\nThey were convinced that no one would ever want to look at their pictures on a television set.\n\nSteven Sasson, the Eastman Kodak engineer who built the first digital camera in 1975.\nRosetta Watches as Comet 67P Erupts\nAs Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko orbited closer to the sun, a fireworks show erupted from its surface.

FLEUR\nAn Octopus That Mates Beak-to-Beak\nThe larger Pacific striped octopus is, despite its name, no bigger than a tangerine. And it has long managed to keep a low profile in the coastal waters off the eastern Pacific.\nIt has appeared only once in scientific journals, and only as a brief mention. In 1982, Arcadio Rodaniche, a marine biologist and illustrator, wrote about behaviors that were unheard-of among octopuses, including intimate beak to beak mating. His surprising findings were dismissed by other scientists.\nBut now, more than 30 years later, Mr. Rodaniches findings about the the larger Pacific striped octopus are gaining newfound credibility.\nRoy Caldwell, a researcher of invertebrate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and his team obtained 24 of these octopuses from private collectors in Nicaragua and have just published their research in the journal PLOS One.\nThe species is indeed unusual. While other octopuses mate by mounting, the larger Pacific striped octopus engages in beak to beak mating, a much closer act, as the beaks are on the underside of their bodies. Females of the species have also been found to brood over their eggs for up to six months, far longer than females of other species of octopus.\nThey also appear to be surprisingly social creatures. The 24 octopuses that Dr. Caldwell studied were placed in groups of eight in large tanks. None of them killed any of their tankmates (octopuses are no strangers to cannibalism), and by all appearances they seemed to get along. Male and female mates even shared a den for up to three days.\nThe larger Pacific striped octopus also uses a slow bounce to hunt. With its body flattened, and dorsal arms reaching forward, the octopus glides with sporadic bursts of hopping movements before it snatches up its prey of choice  usually shrimp. For Dr. Caldwell, the movement reminded him of a tiger stalking a prey.\nASHAKI LLOYD\nAnyone (With a Ham Radio License) Can Call the International Space Station\nA British man radioed the International Space Station and was \"stunned\" when one of the astronauts responded.\n\"They came back to me and said, 'Receiving you  welcome aboard the International Space Station',\" Adrian Lane of Coleford, England, told the BBC last week. He chatted for about 45 seconds before the connection was lost.\nIt turns out this happens all the time.\n\"Its not very unusual,\" said Kyle Herring, a spokesman at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\nIt is not that people are breaking into the radio communications between the space station and mission control. \"It wouldnt be on the space-to-ground system we use,\" Mr. Herring said.\nRather, there is a ham radio on the space station like the ones used by amateur radio enthusiasts around the world. It is how space station astronauts conduct Q&A sessions with students, for instance.\nThe space station's ham radio frequencies are publicly available and you too can try to call the space station when it passes 250 miles above. (That is, if you have the proper equipment and required radio license.)\nThat does not mean anyone will answer, but sometimes one of the astronauts will be there and will converse. Of the two NASA astronauts currently on the space station, Kjell N. Lindgren, who joined the crew last month, does have a ham radio license while Scott J.

What may seem like beautiful purple flowers to us appear to the insects as bright ultraviolet signs saying \"We're Open.\"\nThat's because although both human and honeybee eyes have three-color receptors called cones, human eyes are sensitive to blue, green and red light, while honeybee eyes are sensitive to blue, green and ultraviolet light.\nEyes with different types of cones observe different parts of the light spectrum. So peacocks (which have four cones), ferrets (which have two) and some dogfish (which have none) all see the world a bit differently.\nResearchers at the University of Exeter in Britain have now created a tool that transforms digital photos into what they are calling animal vision, allowing researchers to view images as they would be seen by a honeybee, peacock, ferret or other type of animal.\nBy applying special filters to certain images, the software can imitate the different types of light that specific animals in their data set see.\nIn the case of the flowers, the software illuminates the UV light that bees observe but is undetectable to the human eye. The authors said they think their tool will help biologists better understand visual signals from animals and plants.\nA report about the tool, which is free to download but requires certain image processing programs to use, was published in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution last Thursday.\nNICHOLAS ST. FLEUR\nOpening Night of the Perseid Meteor Showers Annual Show\nThis week take a little drive to the beach, a field, or anywhere dark with a clear view. Bring a blanket and a pocket full of wishes, because the annual Perseid meteor shower will fill the sky with shooting stars. At its peak, between Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, an average of one shooting star a minute will zip through the night sky.\nVincent Perlerin of the American Meteor Society recommends checking out the sky during the hours just before dawn.\nIt may appear as if stars are darting at you from all directions. But trace each meteor backward, and youll see that all the lines come radially from the constellation Perseus.\nThe higher this constellation is in your sky, the better your view, says astronomer Jackie Faherty of the American Museum of Natural History. That means that the northeastern United States and other places with mid-northern latitudes close to 45 degrees, where Perseus is, will get a particularly good view, she says.\nThe Perseid meteor shower is the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle, a ball of gas and ice 16 miles across  more than twice the size of the object that we think killed the dinosaurs.\nYou definitely dont want to see the source of your beautiful meteor shower, said Dr. Faherty.\nAlthough we call them shooting stars, the meteors we see flying through the sky are actually dust-sized particles of debris burning up in Earths atmosphere. Meteor showers result when Earth passes through the orbit of a comet  such as Swift-Tuttle  or an asteroid.\nA moon will ruin it for you, says Dr. Faherty. But youre in luck because this year the peak coincides with the new moon of Aug. 14. That means that the best night to point your pupils at the sky is Thursday, Aug. 13  youll get the most showers with the least moonlight to outshine them.\nJOANNA KLEIN\nLefties Discovered\nThe left-handed, a minority among humans with few advantages unless they can throw a baseball or a punch, have just gotten some reinforcements from the far reaches of the animal kingdom. Scientists have discovered that red kangaroos are mostly southpaws. So are eastern gray kangaroos, and red-necked wallabies to a lesser extent.\nBut it's not the lefty dominance that is important to science. For the Russian and Australian scientists who reported their findings Thursday in Current Biology, the big news is that kangaroos show quite clear hand, or paw, dominance. Humans were thought to be the only mammals with strong, consistent handedness, although apes show some dominance on one side.\nAndre Giljov and Yego Malaschichev at St. Petersburg State University, along with other researchers, thought it might be a good idea to go beyond primates to look at marsupials, the mammals that keep their babies in pouches, like kangaroos and opossums.\nWhat attracted them to kangaroos is that some of them stand on two legs, and can use their forelimbs for manipulating objects, while others use all four legs to move. And it turned out that bipedalism was the telling factor in which kangaroos showed the lefty dominance. Tree-dwelling kangaroos who move on all fours did not show a strong bias.\nThat, said Dr. Malaschichev, is evidence that a bipedal life drives the evolution of left- or right-handedness.\nWhy left rather than right? That's still a mystery. But if kangaroos do start to play baseball, the influx of southpaws could drive managers crazy.\nJAMES GORMAN\nTheres only two places on the earth where wildlife at a large scale has actually increased in the 20th century, and those are North America and southern Africa.

Why Wasn't There an Eclipse?\nLast week, NASA released a glorious animated GIF of the moon passing in front of the Earth that looked like a bad Photoshop cut-and-paste. (The colors do not even line up right.)\nThe Deep Space Climate Observatory, the spacecraft to which the pictures were credited, is located at the L1 Lagrangian Point, a fancy name for the point in space nearly a million miles away where the gravitational pull of the sun and of the Earth essentially cancel out. But that would mean the sun was directly behind the spacecraft, and the shadow of the moon should have crossed Earth as it passed in front.\nBut there's no shadow  and such lighting incongruities are usually the smoking gun of manipulated images.\nThose convinced that NASA has been faking pictures since 1969 might see this as just another example.\nNASA, of course, explains otherwise.\nThe spacecraft, called Dscovr for short, is not exactly at L1, but instead circles around it. (That makes sense, because there are four spacecraft at L1, and one would not want them to smash into one another.)\nAdam Szabo, the NASA scientist in charge of Dscovr's Earth-facing camera, said via email, \"As the small sliver of shadow at the right edge of the moon shows, Dscovr is about 5 degrees away from the sun-Earth line. Thus, when the moon is between Dscovr and Earth, it is not exactly between the sun and Earth, so no eclipse.\"\nBut imagine the amazing images Dscovr will capture during the next partial solar eclipse, on Sept. 13, and total solar eclipse, on March 9 next year.\n(NASA explains that the mismatched colors are because of the movement of the moon. Each color image is a composite of three black-and-white pictures taken through three different color filters about 30 seconds apart, which is why you see a thin arc of green at the right side of the moon.)\nBy the way, the side of the moon seen in the animation is the far side, not the dark side. It is facing the sun, so therefore it would be bright  daytime, just like on the surface of the Earth. Just as on Earth, half of the moon is always in darkness  nighttime, in other words  but the far side is not continually dark.\nUpdate: According to the NASA team, the partial solar eclipse on Sept. 13 will probably not provide much to see from Dscovr's position. \"The moon will be completely outside the cameras field of view,\" Stephen Cole, a NASA spokesman, said via email.\nBut the March 2016 total eclipse could be a cool sight indeed. \"Thats iffy at this point because the spacecraft orbital dynamics are still getting settled,\" Mr. Cole said. \"But if orbital mechanics work out just right, EPIC\"  as NASA calls the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera aboard the spacecraft  \"could capture the moons round shadow moving across the equator. The moon itself may also be in the field of view.\"\nKENNETH CHANG\nQ&A: What Would Happen If Mosquitoes Disappeared?\nQ. If the planet were rid of all mosquitoes, would there be any negative environmental consequences?\nA. It is impossible to know for sure, because so many varieties of mosquitoes fill so many environmental niches, feeding on and being fed on by such a variety of other creatures, and because many of these interactions have not been studied.\nBut it is only natural that people, pestered by itchy bites and bearing the brunt of mosquito-borne diseases, would hope the answer is no.\nMany birds, bats, amphibians, fish, spiders and other insects feed on mosquitoes, but many mosquito-control specialists say they usually do not eat enough mosquitoes to control them, let alone to make the loss of mosquitoes crucial to whether the predators survive.\nIn-depth studies have found that mosquitoes form at most 3 percent of the voracious purple martins diet, according to the American Mosquito Control Association. A survey of scientists on mosquito eradication, published in 2010 by the journal Nature, concluded by quoting the head of the association, who said that eradication would be a hiccup for the environments where mosquitoes are active and that something better or worse would take over.\nC.

Among the confessions were tales of elephants crushing trap cameras, paleontologists accidentally swallowing fossils, and one case where a researcher unintentionally glued herself to a crocodile.\nNot all fieldwork mistakes are as amusing, but even the unfunny ones can be fortuitous. For Carlos Jared, a biologist from the Butantan Institute in So Paulo, Brazil, a mishap in the desert led to a new discovery.\nDr. Jared had been studying tree frogs in the cactus and thorn forests of northeastern Brazil for decades. But on one particular day he wanted to get his hands on Corythomantis greeningi, a frog with a helmet-shaped head covered in tiny spines.\nDuring collection, very soon I realized that when grasping them with the palm of the hand, they intensely move the head in a characteristic butting behavior, Dr. Jared said in an email. Later he felt a sharp pain radiating through his arm, which he described as being far worse than the worst wasp sting imaginable. Dr. Jared was at least four hours away from any hospital, so he decided to tough it out in the desert. Five hours later, the excruciating pain subsided on its own.\nIt wasnt until he examined the frogs under a microscope that he discovered that the spines on their upper lips were covered in poison glands. It took me a long time to realize that the pain had a relationship with the intense and careless collection of these animals hitting the palm of my hands, he said. When the frog head-butted him, it envenomed him too.\nResearchers already knew that the frog secretes toxins from its skin, but the poisoned spines on the head had not been documented before. Dr. Jared and his colleagues found that the same spiny and bony head occurs in another frog species, Aparasphenodon brunoi, which lives in the Atlantic rain forests of South America. They decided to test how toxic the two frogs were in the lab by injecting the poisons into rodents. To their surprise, they found that in mice, A. brunoi's secretions were 25 times as lethal as a Brazilian pit viper's venom, and those of C. greeningi, the one that pricked Dr. Jared, were twice as lethal.\nAlthough Dr. Jared did not tweet his fieldwork faux pas, he did mention it along with his findings in a paper published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.\nThis is the first time anyone has suggested that a frog can be venomous, according to Edmund Brodie, a biologist from Utah State University and co-author on the paper. Hundreds of species of frogs are poisonous, like the Amazons brightly colored poison dart frog. But to be classified as venomous, a creature must have a method by which it can inflict that poison into a victim. For these two frogs, flailing the head suffices.\nIt all started because Carlos was out collecting them and got jabbed in the hand by one of them, Dr. Brodie said. This is how one makes those Eureka discoveries!\nNICHOLAS ST. FLEUR\nWhats That Bubble? A Dying Stars Glowing Remains\nA gigantic glowing bubble in the constellation Hydra is actually a planetary nebula, a gas cloud formed from a dying star. A striking new picture of the so-called Southern Owl Nebula was captured by the European Southern Observatorys Very Large Telescope in Chile. The orb has a diameter of almost four light-years. A planetary nebula lasts tens of thousands of years and then fades, leaving behind a stellar remnant that persists for about a billion years. The remnant then becomes a hot, dense white dwarf that cools over billions of years.\nSINDYA N.

So it is only fitting that a variation of the unstable metal, known as plutonium 238, would be at the heart of the New Horizons mission that flew past the former ninth planet last month.\nThis isotope releases energy in the form of heat as it decays. New Horizons transforms the heat energy into electricity capable of powering its voyage through the solar system.\nAfter directing the spacecraft beyond the dwarf planet, that decaying heart was beating, and beating well, and beating still, said Jim Green, the director of the planetary science division at NASA headquarters, in a news conference after the flyby. Radioisotope power enables us to move further out into the solar system, and its on a trajectory to leave.\nBy now, New Horizons has gone about 15 million miles beyond Pluto, and is steadily beaming data from the flyby back to Earth.\nThe energy conversion takes place in the craft's 125-pound generator, called the General Purpose Heat Source-Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. New Horizons was stocked with 24 pounds of plutonium that produced about 240 watts of electricity when it left Earth in 2006, according to Ryan Bechtel, an engineer from the Department of Energy who works on space nuclear power. During the Pluto flyby the battery produced 202 watts, Mr. Bechtel said.\nThe power will continue to decrease as the metal decays, but there is enough of it to command the probe for another 20 years, according to Curt Niebur, a NASA program scientist on the New Horizons mission.\nIn that time the spacecraft will have traveled 5.6 billion miles past Pluto. Its plutonium heart will beat softer with every mile, until it decreases to the point where there is no longer enough to support the systems that operate the spacecraft and communicate with Earth, according to Dr. Niebur.\nWhen that happens, the craft will continue combing through the cosmos at the same speed and in the same direction until something stops it, Dr. Niebur said. But if nothing in the vast emptiness of space impedes New Horizons' travels, then \"it will just keep going, forever, all alone in the deep dark,\" he said.\nNICHOLAS ST. FLEUR\nGiant Tortoises Island Hop Across the Galpagos\nGiant Galpagos tortoises, the worlds biggest, have had it rough. Thanks to pirates and whalers eating them and to non-native species like goats destroying their habitat, four of the 14 documented species are extinct. Most recently, the Pinta species vanished with the 2012 death of Lonesome George, after decades of attempts to get him to reproduce.\nBut the tortoises emerging from the crates above represent a milestone in tortoise restoration efforts. They are among 201 tortoises recently released onto Santa Fe Island, which lost its tortoise species a century and a half ago.\nWe wanted to do this for a long time, said Linda Cayot, the science adviser for the Galpagos Conservancy, which, in collaboration with the Galapagos National Park Directorate, runs the Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative. It wasnt easy. Without any Santa Fe tortoises left (nobody alive now has actually seen them  their existence is known mainly from whalers logbooks and museum-preserved bone fragments), conservationists turned to a close genetic relative: tortoises from Espaola Island.\nEspaola is itself a tortoise success story. By the 1960s, the island was so sparsely populated that its 12 females and two males never even crossed paths to mate. Brought to a breeding center on another island, they were joined by a male from the San Diego Zoo, who some naturalists nicknamed Diego and who became the major stud, Dr. Cayot said. The other two males stepped up too.\nThe tortoise eggs were incubated, at temperatures adjusted to hatch two females for every male (slightly warmer eggs produce females). At about age 4, able to withstand predators, babies were placed on Espaola, which now has about 1,000 tortoises, Dr. Cayot said. Santa Fe was next.\nBefore dawn on June 27, 201 Espaola tortoises between 4 and 10 years old were ferried there and carried, up to 12 in a backpack, on a long rocky trail to Santa Fes interior. The 30 oldest, including two pictured above, have radio transmitters glued to their carapaces.\nPeriodically, conservationists will find those tortoises to study their movement and effects on vegetation, Dr. Cayot said, noting that about half of repatriated tortoises die because of scarcity of food and water. Those who find what they need are likely to live a century or more.\nPAM BELLUCK\nOur traditional foods are killing our people.

Go back and watch it again. This time look carefully for long, white plumes drifting down the islands coast. This isnt sand kicked up by the waves, its actually swaths of bacteria thriving off shallow water hydrothermal vents that continuously spew sulfur and carbon dioxide. Scientists think the vents and the life around them may offer some clues to how and where life on Earth started.\nThe vents are located off Kueishantao Island, near Taiwans north east coast. Underwater, the vents look like bubbling chimneys. They heat the water to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and drive the waters pH way down, to between 1 and 3. (Normal pH of the ocean is around 8.)\nThis is the most extreme environment known to humans and oceans in terms of pH, that we know, said Mario Lebrato, a Spanish oceanographer studying the vents along with a team of scientists funded by the German Ministry of Research, Christian-Albrechts-Universitt zu Kiel, and the National Taiwan Ocean University.\nNormally these conditions would make it difficult for sealife, but what is so unusual, Dr. Lebrato said, is that the area around the vents is full of crabs and corals.\nDr. Lebrato said the scientists want to know what biological traits allow the organisms to survive. Life on Earth, he said, may have started in similar volcanic sites.\nEMILY HAGER\nSee a video you want explained?

On the weather and astronomy page, I saw a first-quarter moon depicted as a moon with a vertical slice off the left side. I had always thought of this as a half moon. If it is a quarter moon, is there such a thing as a half moon?\nA. The half-illuminated disk of the moon that we see and often refer to informally as a half moon is a quarter of the way along its journey in time from new moon (dark) to crescent moon to full moon (fully illuminated) and back again. It is also a quarter of the way along the moons journey in space as it orbits Earth. For that reason, modern astronomers refer to this phase as the first-quarter moon. They also refer to a later half moon phase, seen with the vertical slice off the right side, as the third-quarter moon. (The sides are reversed when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere.)\nHalf moon was a familiar term to poets like Shakespeare (1564-1619) and to the Dutchmen who called Henry Hudsons ship the Halve Maen when it sailed into New York Harbor in 1609. But to confuse matters further, such older sources were often referring to the crescent moon, either waxing or waning.\nIn reality, of course, exactly half the surface of the moon is illuminated by the sun at all times. What waxes and wanes is not the moon itself but the part of the illuminated side that can be seen by observers on Earth, owing to the changing angles formed by the sun, Earth and the moon.\nC.

Its not an Andy Warhol. And its not your grandmother's cross-stitch, either. Scientists at NYU Langone Medical Center have genetically altered basic yeast and created these images in living color. This is a live yeast portrait of Gregor Mendel, far right, the ultimate nod to the father of modern genetics.\nFor centuries, humans have played around with yeast. In ancient days, we domesticated it to make beer and bread. This artwork is just a way to visualize the next frontier of yeast manipulation.\nA few years ago, the geneticist Dr. Jef Boeke and his laboratory at NYU got together with researchers worldwide to synthetically recreate the 16-chromosome genome of brewers yeast. The goal of the effort, called Synthetic Yeast 2.0, is to better understand the complicated web of genetic interactions that underlie all biological processes, Dr. Boeke said.\nLast year, the research group made its first breakthrough when they created a designer chromosome called SynIII. The yeast still worked with this synthetic chromosome, even after 50,000 changes to the original chromosome they manipulated.\nAlthough Dr. Boekes biopointillism, revealed at a New York Genome Center meeting earlier this month, isnt part of Synthetic Yeast 2.0, the artwork shows that dabbling with yeast genomes can produce phenotypic, if not behavioral changes.\nNaturally, basic bakers yeast is off-white, but by adding just one gene that produces red fluorescent protein, Dr. Boekes lab made it red. To get orange and yellow, they altered genes to pump out beta carotene, the pigment found in carrots. Purple was hard, and green still isnt perfect. To create the images you see here, a robot picked up tiny droplets of color-producing yeast strains and used sound waves to blast them upward into preprogrammed cells on an agar growth plate. The scientists then incubated the plate, and the colors got stronger as the yeast grew.\nThe lab can make 10 colors in all, and Dr. Boeke challenges every new member of his lab to add a color to the palette. Dr. Boeke said he was interested in developing yeast strains that could communicate and signal color changes, say from red to pink, when in proximity to one another.\nJust for the record, this doesnt mean youre going to see purple beer or fuschia bread. Dr. Boeke hasnt tried it, but he said there was not enough yeast used in the products for the color to show up.\nJOANNA KLEIN\nAn Extraordinary Humpback Whale Sighting in Alaska\nOn July 12, researchers aboard a ship called the Northern Song spotted a humpback whale lunge feeding and enjoying some krill in Frederick Sound, Alaska.\nIt was no ordinary sighting, and the scientists were ecstatic: They say the observation is only the most recent in the longest string of sightings of any humpback in the world.\nThe whale, whom the researchers named Old Timer, was first seen in Lynn Canal in southeast Alaska 44 years ago by Charles Jurasz, a pioneer in whale research. Old Timer was already fully grown. He is believed to be at least 50 years old now.\nIts really a celebration of whales since humans largely have stopped hunting them, said Adam Pack, a biologist at the University of Hawaii and one of the researchers who identified Old Timer.\nThe whale was immediately recognizable, he said: Some of these whales have such distinct patterns. It lifted its tail flukes, and we saw the underside.\nIn 1990, Old Timer was spotted off the coast of Hawaii escorting a mother-calf pair. He was observed again in 2006, defending his position next to a lone female from other competing males. That sighting confirmed he was male, Dr. Pack said.\nLong-term records of sightings help researchers learn more about whales fidelity to particular habitats, migratory patterns, female reproductive rates and the behavioral roles that the whales adopt.\nSINDYA N.

But on Saturday night, that light show was upstaged by another kind of display: projections of images of endangered species lower down on the iconic midtown office tower.\nThis video captured excerpts of the work of Louie Psihoyos and Travis Threlkel, the artists who cast digital images of a variety of threatened animal species across the Empire State Buildings south face on Saturday. Mr. Psihoyos explained that they had set out to do the most dramatic thing we could do to get the world to know about what were losing.\nTo make their statement, the artists used 40 projectors on the roof of another building a few blocks south. And whether the project succeeded in expanding awareness of threats to the planet's biodiversity, it made an impression on some of the people who gazed upon it firsthand.\nWitnessed some spectacular Big [Apple] magic last night, wrote Becca Zoler, an Instagram user, with a photo she posted of the display.\nThis Lifeguard Sees a Drowning Child, Do You?\nCan you spot the drowning child in the image here? An average of 10 people a day die from unintentional drowning according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but often its a quiet struggle that hardly resembles the dramatic affair we see on television.\nSoftware engineer Francisco Saldaa created the simple educational game spotthedrowningchild.com to help people recognize the deadly situation. A person who is drowning is physiologically incapable of calling out or waving for help  meaning often there is little noise or splash.\nIn his marine safety guide Mario Vittone, a Coast Guard veteran, describes some things to look for instead:\nThe individuals mouth bobs above and below the surface while the body remains upright without evidence of kicking.\nThe individuals arms spread to the side and push down against the water to try and push their mouths out of the water.\nThe videos that Mr. Saldaa used show lifeguards successfully rescuing children from drowning and come from the YouTube channel of the Genesis Project in Charleston County, which aims to reduce the number of drownings in rural areas by providing access to swimming and water safety classes.\nALBERT SUN\nWhats That Science Thing: Bacteria Edition\nIn this photo, a bacterial colony rests atop a gridded surface. That gridded surface is:\nA. A bacterial sieve that separates bigger pathogens from smaller ones.\nB. A type of camera for deriving images from certain varieties of molecules.\nC. A microbial grater used to thinly slice samples for observation under a microscope.\nD. A coordinate plane to track the location of individual bacteria.\nClick for the answer!\nThe correct answer is B  a camera chip.\nThat salmon-colored expanse is a colony of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a source of infections that is familiar in hospitals. The grid beneath it is an electrochemical camera chip, a new tool that researchers at Columbia University are using to better understand the behavior of communities of bacteria.\nThe camera chips electrochemical imaging process is something like taking a movie over time, said Dr. Ken Shepard, a professor of electrical engineering and biomedical engineering and one of the researchers on the project. By recording the chemical activities of the bacteria, the researchers are able to learn more about the mechanisms that individual cells use to organize themselves into a community. Marshaling one billion individual P. aeruginosa cells into the colony formation pictured here, for instance, required a considerable amount of coordination on the part of the cells.\nWhen bacteria coalesce to form multicellular structures, they secrete what are known as signaling molecules. This new electrochemical camera chip can detect the distribution of these molecules and interpret that information to find patterns that suggest how individual bacteria communicate with one another when they organize into these impressive multicellular communities.\nDr. Shepard and his colleagues direct the colonies by manipulating conditions on the chip  for example, the presence or absence of oxygen. Then, the camera chip observes how the bacteria respond under those different conditions. By measuring the concentration and distribution of phenazines, a type of signaling molecule emitted by P. aeruginosa, the camera chip is able to extract temporal and spatial patterns from the bacterias reconfiguration, Dr. Shepard explained.\nIdentifying how these multicellular structures form is critical to learning how to disrupt that formation. And because some cell configurations are known to contribute to antibiotic resistance, there is a very real benefit to furthering our understanding of how to interfere with the behavior of bacteria.\nNot quite as easy as snapping a photo, but it can be done.\nLOUIS LUCERO II\nIf work were going well and you had a great relationship, you wouldnt get the chance to drink with people.\n\nAn excerpt from a chat with Xiaoice, a popular Microsoft chatbot that mines the Chinese Internet to make conversation with people.\nWhat About Cecil the Lion's Unnamed Cousins?\nThe outcry over the killing of Cecil the lion suggests a strategy for saving the many other lions that are threatened by hunters. What if they too had names? All of them.\nPeople have been killing a lot of lions for a long time. How many? In a major report in 2009, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimated that hunting tourists killed 105,000 animals per year. That included 3,800 buffalo, 800 leopards, 640 elephants and 600 lions  more than 2 percent of the lion population.\nBut for them the world is a reverse \"Cheers.\" Nobody knows their names. The death of Cecil  dark-maned, living in a park, studied by scientists and known to tourists  was greeted as tragic. It was illegal to kill him, which no doubt accounts for some of the uproar. And he certainly looked appealing in photos.\nBut you can't underestimate the importance of a name. When you name another creature, you assign it a certain status. You might name a pet pig, but probably not one destined for bacon.\nThere are about 20,000 lions left in Africa according to Panthera, a conservation group. Imagine if they all had names. Pessimists may object that it's hard to name 20,000 animals, but we have computers. There's already a website that advertises 20,000+ names.\nIf you don't think this will work, here's a test.

Farmers Almanac calls it the fourth full moon in an astronomical season, which usually has just three.\nA truly blue-colored moon can result following a dust storm or volcanic eruption when super tiny dust particles refract blue light. Thats rare.\nFull moon fun fact, blue or not: researchers have found that some doodlebugs dig deeper holes to catch prey during this time in the lunar cycle.\nJOANNA KLEIN\nGraphene Origami\nGraphene is a thin material with tremendous potential. Measuring only an atom-thick, it is harder than diamond, a better electrical conductor than copper, and 200 times as strong as steel.\nGraphene is so strong that a sheet of it stretched across a coffee-cup should be able to support the weight of a truck bearing down on a pencil point. Some researchers call it a wonder material that could be used in everything from batteries and biosensors to computers and condoms.\nNow researchers have discovered another one of graphene's feats: It's as flexible as paper. Not only can graphene be crumpled and then perfectly flattened, but it can also be folded like origami, according to a report published Wednesday in Nature.\nUsing a style of origami that involves cuts and folds called kirigami, the researchers fashioned a sheet of graphene into a tiny spring. According to Nature, researchers may one day use kirigami to craft graphene sheets into microscopic weighing scales or nets small enough to wrap around living cells.\nNICHOLAS ST.

The last Wednesday and Thursday of July are the days that the ponies paddle 75 yards to the other side of the water on Wednesday before parading through town to be auctioned off on Thursday.\nSome locals call the ponies wild, but they are actually feral, meaning at one point they escaped domestication. The most popular origin story is that the Chincoteague ponies survived a 17th Century Spanish shipwreck. With little evidence to support that popular tale, however, a more plausible one is that settlers kept ponies on the island to avoid a 1669 horse tax.\nOver their 400 year history, these island mutts have demonstrated a keen ability to stick around. Theyre short and stocky; svelte in the summer, puffy in the winter. They survive on marsh grasses and poison ivy  whatever they can get their snouts on.\nWith no apex predators, the two herds on the island would be a problem if not managed. Grazing ponies would disrupt fiddler crab activity and take food and nesting habitat from other animals like deer and marsh birds, according to Kelly Taylor, science communicator at Assateague Island National Seashore.\nAlong with being a good way to raise funds for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department, the auction of their private herd on the Virginia side of the island reduces the population and protects the environment. On the Maryland side however, the National Park Service cant sell public wildlife, so they put their herd on birth control. Only the Virginia ponies take part in the swim.\nJOANNA KLEIN\nCorrection: July 30, 2015: An earlier version of this post misstated the day the ponies swim each year. While it occurred on the last Wednesday of July this year, if July 31 is a Wednesday, the swim occurs the week before.\nHow to Vacation With Puffins\nWhen we planned our family vacation this year, we had one thing in mind: puffins.

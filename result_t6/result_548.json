        "content": "Theres no evidence that Hillary Clinton once said shed like to see \"people like Donald Trump run for office.\"\nThe widely debunked claim features a picture of Clinton standing next to Trump. Below the image is text that says, \"Hillary Clinton in 2013: I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought. \"\nClinton did not say that. Thats a fabricated quote thats circulated for years on Facebook and websites associated with satire and misinformation.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe picture associated with the claim is from Donald and Melania Trumps 2005 wedding reception, which Clinton attended. The quote is a spinoff from a speech Clinton reportedly gave to Goldman Sachs in 2013. A transcript of the alleged speech was published by WikiLeaks, as it released emails stolen from John Podesta, Clintons 2016 presidential campaign manager. NPR reported in 2016 that the Clinton campaign refused to verify the documents authenticity.\nClinton, according to the Wikileaks transcript for that 2013 Goldman Sachs speech, was asked whether a \"wholesale change\" was needed in Washington in terms of people running for office.\nClintons response: \"That's a really interesting question. You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office. I really would like to see that because I do think, you know, you don't have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom. And there's that memorable phrase from a former member of the Senate: You can be maybe rented but never bought.\"\nThe transcript doesnt say that Clinton specifically mentioned Trump by name.\nAs Snopes and Factcheck.org noted, the quote attributed to Clinton stemmed from websites claiming to be a \"hybrid\" of news and satire.\nClinton did not say, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought.\"\nWe rate that made-up quote as False.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the visual presence of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the image, confirming the entities mentioned in the caption. However, it fails to validate the core claim of the caption â€“ that Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.  The internal check acknowledges this limitation, giving a true verdict based only on the presence of the individuals, not on the implied relationship asserted in the caption.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim.  It references a Politifact article that definitively refutes the statement, tracing its origins to misinformation sources and highlighting its falsity.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check supports this refutation.  The discrepancy lies in the scope of validation: the internal check validates only the literal presence of individuals, while the external check evaluates the truthfulness of the implied assertion in the caption.  The image, showing Clinton and Trump together, does not offer support for the caption's main claim, despite the internal check's focus on visual representation. Considering the weight of the external evidence and the factual inaccuracy of the claim, the caption is deemed out of context.  There's no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization; the image is authentic.  The significant difference between internal and external validation results reflects the difference in the scope of analysis. The internal check is limited to the visual contents and fails to address the central, unsubstantiated claim in the caption. The external check, by providing evidence from a reputable source, successfully verifies the falsity of the caption. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context, with a high confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the presence of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the image but fails to verify the claim about Clinton's desire for Trump's candidacy. External validation strongly refutes the claim using Politifact as a source, highlighting the caption's out-of-context nature."

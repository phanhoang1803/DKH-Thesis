        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump suggested he'd use nuclear weapons against Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a wall.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 March 2016, Politicalo published an article reporting that Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 election, said he would use nuclear weapons on Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a border wall:\nIn a Donald Trump administration, the U.S. military will be so strong that Mexico wont dare to go to war over the wall Trump wants to build between the two countries. On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall? Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isnt playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials emphatic insistence that theyll never cough up the dough.\nBecause nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that, the billionaire businessman added. We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. Thats how I know theyre bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, Im going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when Im done building it, Im going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteens Born In The USA to them, just for the hell of it. You just dont mess with the U.S., and thats that ... Let me tell you, weve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think thats a pretty definitive message, and thats the hard way. Now, Ive said before that political correctness is whats killing this country, and Im standing by it. However, since Ive never been a warmonger, Im trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, well have no problem. If they dont and they start acting up, well, well just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.\nComments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from an MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:\nOn MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\nTrust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn't playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday.\nOne of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials' emphatic insistence that they'll never cough up the dough.\nMexican President Pea Nieto blasted Trump in two separate interviews this week, slamming the billionaire's strident expressions to a Mexico City newspaper and warning that the kind of rhetoric he uses has led to very fateful scenes in the history of humanity.\nThat's the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived, Pea Nieto said. Trump's comments, he told El Universal, have \"hurt the relationship we have sought with the United States.\"\nThe first portion of the article may have led readers to think that the subsequent claims were real, but everything beyond its first paragraph was fabricated. Content published by the self-styled \"hybrid\" news sites Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo built upon controversial current events with related embellishments. Politicalo and related sites featured a button enabling readers to \"Show Facts\" or \"Hide Facts\":\nHowever, every Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo item opened in \"Hide Facts\" mode by default, making the embellishments difficult for readers to identify. In addition to its \"Show Facts/Hide Facts\" feature, Politicalo's disclaimer explained:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nPrevious Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo articles that caused social media confusion included claims that Marco Rubio said women should be taken into custody if they were considering an abortion (and that Zika was a punishment from God), Pat Robertson said gay people should wear colors by which heterosexual people could identify them in public, Pastor John Piper said bikini waxes were a sin in the eyes of God, David Bowie was alive but held hostage by Satanic entities, Ted Cruz said God would not have allowed Antonin Scalia to die at a time that was not politically expedient, a Republican lawmaker proposed saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for food stamp recipients, and Bristol Palin said that more black actors weren't nominated for Oscars because they all looked alike.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes indicates that a news article falsely claimed Trump threatened nuclear weapons against Mexico.  The Snopes article itself does not confirm that Trump made such a threat. Therefore, there is no supporting evidence for the claim in the news caption.",

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the presence of entities mentioned in the caption within the image. It correctly identifies Donald Trump but notes the absence of Mexico. The low confidence score reflects the limitation of this check, as it only assesses textual consistency, not factual accuracy.  The external check utilizes Snopes, which reports on a false news article claiming Trump threatened nuclear weapons against Mexico.  This contradicts the caption's claim.  The low confidence score here stems from the lack of direct confirmation from Snopes about Trump making the threat. There's a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. The internal check, solely based on image content, is limited, and the external check is weakened by the lack of direct evidence.  Overall, the evidence leans toward the caption being out of context. The image shows Trump speaking; however, there is no visual evidence to support the claim about a threat to Mexico.  The external check's failure to definitively confirm the threat contributes to the low confidence score. Because the main point of the caption (the threat against Mexico) is not supported and the source cited casts doubt on the claim, the caption is assessed as out of context.  The low confidence score acknowledges the lack of definitive proof, while the OOC status reflects the weight of the evidence suggesting that the caption's context may be incorrect.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially confirms the presence of Donald Trump, but external check reveals a false news report concerning the threat to Mexico.  The conflicting findings, combined with the lack of direct evidence supporting the caption's claim, result in a low confidence score and an 'out of context' verdict."

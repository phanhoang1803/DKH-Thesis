By precooking it and blending it in a special way, he was able to make a fully cooked 100% bacon paste that could be squeezed from a tube. Knowing he had discovered something paradigm-shifting, young Vilhelm Lilleflsk quickly went into business. That, dear friends, is when Squeez Bacon was born. And this delicious delectable from Sweden has finally been brought over to the USA - now with American Flavor!\nBoth Squeez Bacon and Vilhelm Lilleflsk are made-up entities created for ThinkGeek's annual April Fools' Day fake product launch. A November 2009 New York Times Magazine piece referencing Squeez Bacon described that tradition, which began in 2001:\nOn April 1 of each year since 2001, ThinkGeek, the online retailer, has devoted its home page to products that dont exist. The names sound unlikely  Squeez Bacon, Surgestix Inhalable Caffeine Stix, p-Teqs USB Pregnancy Test Kit, etc.  but they are presented as any item on the site would be: catalog description and list of features, pictures, maybe a video, price, Buy Now button. Click that and . . . ThinkGeek wishes you a happy April Fools Day.\nAccording to an April 2, 2009, story on the website Bacon Today, this is the image people attempting to procure Squeez Bacon would have seen had they added the product to their cart:\nDespite the fact that ThinkGeek  a website famous for its fake April Fools' Day products  explicitly stated that the product was not real 12 years ago, there remains confusion online as to the feasibility of buying a tube of Squeez Bacon. A Jan. 30, 2021, Reddit post in the \"Thanks I Hate It\" subreddit brought renewed attention to the fake product.\nUnfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your viewpoint) the product remains fictional. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

While the evidence describes Squeez Bacon in the exact terms of the caption, the article ultimately debunks the claim that it is a real product.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that \"Squeez Bacon — fully cooked 100% bacon paste in a tube — is a real product\" is false.  The source details how ThinkGeek created Squeez Bacon as a fictional product for their annual April Fool's Day promotion.",

    "explanation": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's claim. The image clearly shows a product labeled \"Squeez Bacon\", which appears to be a tube of bacon paste, aligning perfectly with the caption's description.  The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10 due to this clear visual and textual agreement. However, external validation reveals a significant discrepancy.  External sources, particularly Snopes, confirm that Squeez Bacon is not a real product; rather, it was a fictional product created by ThinkGeek as an April Fool's joke.  This external evidence directly contradicts the caption's assertion that Squeez Bacon is a \"real product.\" The external check provides a confidence score of 8, reflecting the readily available and reliable information from Snopes debunking the product's existence.  The disagreement between the internal and external checks is significant. While the image strongly suggests the existence of a product called \"Squeez Bacon\" (and indeed, a product of that name was created, albeit for a hoax), the external source clearly indicates this product is not sold commercially as a real, consumable food item.  The external evidence is stronger in this case, owing to its factual nature and lack of inherent visual bias. The image alone might deceive, but the external source provides authoritative context. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context because, while it accurately describes a fictional product's visual representation, it incorrectly implies its real-world existence. The confidence score is 8, reflecting the reliability of the external evidence, acknowledging the internal visual confirmation while prioritizing the verifiable factual information about the product's nature.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation definitively refutes it.  The image shows a product labeled 'Squeez Bacon', matching the caption's description. However, reliable external sources confirm this product is a fictional creation, not a commercially available item."

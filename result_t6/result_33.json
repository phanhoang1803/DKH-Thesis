Facebook content may contain adverts.\nThe imam had saved the Christians in Barkin Ladi area of Plateau state in central Nigeria who were running away from the killers.\nMore than 80 others were killed in the attack that targeted Christians in the area, and the number could have been more without the intervention of the imam.\nThe imam had told the BBC that he wanted to help because more than 40 years ago the Christians in the area had allowed the Muslims to build the mosque.\nAt the event that had US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo present, Imam Abdullahi was said to have \"selflessly risked his own life to save members of another religious community, who would have likely been killed without his intervention.\"\nThe imam had previously received a \"handshake and national honour from Nigerian President Muhamadu Buhari.\n'Shots fired' in southern Ethiopian city\nKalkidan Yibeltal\nBBC Amharic Service, Addis Ababa\nResidents of the southern Ethiopian city of Hawassa, where there has been tension over the declaration of a new regional state, told the BBC they have heard shots being fired.\nEarlier this week, activists from the Sidama people said they would declare the new state on Thursday - a year to the day after the idea of a referendum on the new state was approved by the authorities.\nThe referendum, which should have been held within 12 months, has been delayed, but the electoral board said it would happen in the next five months.\nThat appeared to placate some Sidama activists but it seems that others were not happy.\nIn one area of Hawassa, Alamura, security forces have fired tear gas to disperse youths, witnesses say.\nAn eye witness told me he saw about 50 youths with rocks.\nThe mobile internet connection has now been shut down.\nYouth started gathering in a central meeting place in the morning and witnesses say they saw some of them attempting to attack vehicles.\nBoxer Anthony Joshua has 'powerful moments' at the Shrine in Lagos\nFormer world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua, who spent his early years living in Nigeria, has posted a video of himself visiting the famous Afrika Shrine club in the country's commercial hub, Lagos.\nThe club was built by musician Femi Kuti and named after the venue run by his father Fela.\nThe British-Nigerian boxer has been sharing highlights of his visit to Nigeria, which appears to have begun at the start of this week, on Twitter.\nOn the video of his trip to the Shrine, which has been watched more than 250,000 times, he can be seen welcomed by fans.\nJoshua uses the Femi Kuti song Fight To Win to accompany the images, which he describes as \"powerful moments\":\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

She was immediately released on parole.\nEsther Arunga, 38, was convicted of being an accessory to murder.\nAustralian Associated Press, external quoted prosecutor Danny Boyle as saying that Arunga called emergency services and told them that the boy had fallen down the stairs. But an autopsy revealed Sinclair died as a result of a severe blunt force such as punching or stamping or similar and his injuries were inconsistent with a fall.\nShe later admitted that she lied in order to protect her husband, Quincy Timberlake.\nAccording to Kenya's Standard newspaper, external, it was not until Mr Timberlake was involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility that Arunga changed her statement. She told police that she went to the bathroom on the night of 17 June 2014 to find her husband hitting Sinclair in the stomach before throwing the boy against the wall.\nJudge Boyle said although Arunga did not interfere with evidence, her inaccurate account delayed investigations and her husbands arrest.\nEbola is 'not under control'\nThe head of a medical charity that is at the forefront of dealing with the Ebola outbreak in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has called for a \"change of gear\" in the approach.\nA statement from Joanne Liu, the international president of Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF), came after the World Health Organization declared the Ebola crisis a \"public health emergency of international concern\".\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

    "explanation": "The internal validation provides a confidence score of 8, suggesting a high likelihood that the image depicts Mike Pompeo in a mosque, possibly in Egypt's new administrative capital. The reasoning is based on visual cues (architecture) and the caption's context. However, the external validation completely contradicts this, reporting a confidence score of 0 and stating that there's no evidence of Pompeo visiting a mosque in Egypt.  This significant discrepancy necessitates a conservative approach. The lack of external corroboration significantly weakens the confidence in the caption's accuracy.  While the image itself is consistent with the description (showing Pompeo in a setting resembling a mosque), the complete absence of external verification, coupled with the inability to conclusively confirm the location from the image alone, necessitates a conclusion of \"out of context\".  The architecture might resemble mosques in other Middle Eastern or North African countries. The absence of clear geographical markers or supporting evidence makes it impossible to definitively state the location as Egypt's new administrative capital.  Therefore, despite the internal analysis suggesting some consistency, the absence of external validation outweighs the internal evidence, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. More concrete evidence, such as reliable news articles or official statements, is needed to verify the caption.",

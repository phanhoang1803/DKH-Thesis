While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

    "explanation": "The provided caption claims that Ted Nugent, a 70s rocker, hunting guide, and conservative icon, was shot and killed in a hunting accident.  The image shows Nugent playing a guitar on stage, which directly contradicts the caption's claim of his death.  Internal validation reveals a clear mismatch: the image depicts a living Nugent, while the caption describes his death.  External validation strongly supports this discrepancy.  Multiple sources, including news articles and social media posts, confirm that the report of Nugent's death was a hoax. These sources provide evidence that he was alive and well around the time the false news story circulated, even including a Facebook Live video with his wife.  The external evidence confirms the image's depiction of a living Nugent and refutes the caption's claim of a fatal hunting accident. There is no ambiguity; the caption is demonstrably false and entirely out of context with the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes confirm that the caption is false and out of context. The image shows a living Ted Nugent, while the caption falsely reports his death. External sources definitively debunk the death report, confirming the inaccuracy of the caption."

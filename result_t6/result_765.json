Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a pile of gold during his time in the military.\nIn June 2020, an old photograph supposedly showing U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

    "explanation": "The claim that US Senator Tom Cotton is sitting on a pile of gold is demonstrably false based on a thorough analysis of visual evidence, internal consistency checks, and robust external verification.  The original image juxtaposes a photograph of a soldier sitting amidst a large quantity of gold bars with a portrait of Senator Cotton. The internal check reveals a significant discrepancy: while the image depicts a soldier, there is no textual or visual evidence directly linking this soldier to Senator Cotton. The caption's assertion lacks any internal supporting evidence within the image itself. The external validation process significantly strengthens the case against the caption's accuracy. Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, investigated the image and conclusively determined that the soldier in the photograph is not Senator Cotton.  Snopes provides several crucial pieces of corroborating evidence. First, they identify the photograph as originating from May 2003, predating Senator Cotton's military service, which began in 2005. Second, the soldier is identified as belonging to the 173rd Airborne Brigade, a different unit from the 101st Airborne Division where Senator Cotton served. This discrepancy in unit affiliation further solidifies the conclusion that the two individuals are not the same person.  Further bolstering the external validation is the statement from Senator Cotton's spokesperson directly confirming that the man in the photograph is not the Senator. This authoritative denial leaves no room for doubt regarding the inaccurate nature of the original caption. The visual elements of the image do not provide any evidence to contradict the findings of the internal and external checks. The picture clearly shows two distinct individualsâ€”a soldier in a military uniform and Senator Cotton in civilian attire. There is no visual evidence, such as matching features or clothing items, to suggest they are the same person.  In conclusion, the convergence of internal and external evidence, both strongly indicating a mismatch between the image and the caption, leads to a high level of confidence (confidence score of 10) in determining that the original caption is entirely out of context (OOC = true). The discrepancies highlighted by the internal check, corroborated by the robust external fact-checking from Snopes and Senator Cotton's spokesperson, leave no reasonable doubt that the caption is false and misleading.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly refute the caption's claim. Internal inconsistencies reveal a lack of visual or textual connection between the soldier and Senator Cotton. External verification from Snopes and Senator Cotton's office confirms the soldier pictured is not Senator Cotton.  Visual evidence also supports this conclusion. No discrepancies exist between internal and external findings."

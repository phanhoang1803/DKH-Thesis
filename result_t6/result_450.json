That meme claimed BLM had raised \"over a billion dollars\" but had not used that money to provide necessities such as food, housing, or schooling; instead, they had expended it on buying \"huge charter busses to transport members to riots\":\nAs for the first part of the meme, BLM is a \"decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people\"; it isn't a centrally organized group that was founded for the purpose of feeding the hungry, providing housing, or funding schooling, nor does it raise money on that basis.\nMoreover, the photograph accompanying this meme does not show any buses purchased by BLM \"to transport members to riots,\" or for any other purpose. The vehicles pictured here belong to the Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, who wrapped their buses with the Black Lives Matter name as a show of support for the movement, as documented on the Raptors' Twitter account:",

    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption partially consistent with the image, noting the presence of Black Lives Matter-branded buses but lacking evidence of their use in transporting people to riots.  However, the external check, using a Snopes fact-check, strongly refutes the claim. Snopes definitively states that the image depicts buses belonging to the Toronto Raptors, not Black Lives Matter buses used for transporting individuals to riots. This discrepancy is significant, as the external check is based on a reliable fact-checking source that directly addresses the claim's veracity. The external check carries more weight, due to its reliance on established fact-checking methodology and the clear contradiction of the image's context. The internal check's assessment correctly identifies the presence of BLM-branded buses in the image, but fails to account for the crucial missing context regarding their ownership and purpose.  Given the substantial disagreement and the external source's high confidence score, the caption is deemed out of context. The image, according to the Snopes investigation, shows buses from the Toronto Raptors, completely unrelated to the events suggested in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially supports the caption (buses are branded BLM), but external fact-checking definitively refutes it (buses belong to Toronto Raptors, not BLM, and were not used to transport people to riots), leading to an out-of-context determination."

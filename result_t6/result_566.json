        "content": "Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 15th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.\nUnder the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 15th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original caption, \"President Obama has overruled Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election and ordered a revote,\" is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check correctly identifies the mismatch between the image (showing Trump in distress with a self-reflective quote) and the caption (describing an event that never happened). The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete lack of connection between the image and the caption's claim. The external check reinforces this with a confidence score of 10, citing a reliable source (Snopes) that debunks the claim as \"fake news.\"  The external check elaborates on the source's statement, explaining that while there were calls for recounts and discussions of potential special elections in specific precincts, there was never an official overruling of the election result by President Obama.  There is no visual evidence supporting the claim in the image. In fact, the visual content directly contradicts the claim. The image shows an emotionally charged moment for Trump, not a news event depicting Obama overruling the election.  There is a complete lack of visual evidence depicting any political action or result related to Obama's purported overruling of the 2016 election.  The combination of a completely unrelated image, an internally inconsistent narrative, and a strong external debunking creates a high degree of certainty that the caption is entirely false and out of context. The internal and external validation perfectly align in confirming the caption's falsity and the high confidence score (10) reflects this complete agreement and the strong external evidence provided.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly and unanimously confirm that the provided caption is completely false and out of context with the image.  There is no visual or factual evidence to support the claim. The internal assessment finds no link, and the external assessment uses a reputable source to debunk the claim."

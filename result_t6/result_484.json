        "date": "2019-04-09T12:08:00",
        "content": "Updated at 4:35 p.m. ET\nWhite House lawyers communicated with the Treasury Department about how to handle House Democrats' request for President Trump's tax returns even before they made it, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.\nThe law invoked last week by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., empowers Congress to obtain the returns of any taxpayer directly from the Internal Revenue Service. The process was designed to bypass the White House and give Congress equal authority.\nNeal gave the IRS until this Wednesday to respond to the committee's request. Mnuchin told reporters after the hearing that the official response to Neal's letter could come within that time frame.\nUnder questioning by Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., at a House subcommittee hearing, Mnuchin said: \"I want to be very clear and not misleading. I acknowledge that there were conversations. I am not briefed on the full extent of those conversations.\"\nQuigley told Mnuchin \"we would greatly appreciate it\" if Treasury would report what White House officials had said.\nIRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, making a subsequent appearance before the same House subcommittee, said no one at the tax agency has had any communication with the White House about disclosing presidential tax returns to Congress.\nRettig did not indicate whether the IRS would comply with Neal's request by Wednesday.\nDuring a later appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, Mnuchin said the Treasury Department would follow the law and cooperate with Congress. \"We would not ever ask for the White House's permission on this nor did they give us permission. As I said, we consulted, which I believe was appropriate of our legal department,\" Mnuchin said.\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said the department's communications about Trump's tax returns were \"deeply troubling\" and violated \"the spirit of the law if not the letter.\"\nBut Mnuchin insisted that he would protect the Treasury Department's independence on the tax return issue. \"I'm not afraid of being fired at all.\"\nPresident Trump has turned away all requests that he voluntarily disclose his taxes, as other recent presidents have done. Democrats contend he is withholding his returns to hide financial details that could lead to political or legal problems.\nSome Democrats, such as Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, have been working toward this request almost since the day Trump took the oath of office in 2017.\nThe Trump administration and its allies have launched several counterattacks.\nOne of Trump's personal lawyers, William Consovoy, has said that the House Ways and Means Committee \"cannot legally request\" the information.\nGOP members of Congress have sought to give the administration cover by casting the request as politically motivated. \"It seems like we have a chairman and potentially a party that is attempting to weaponize the IRS for political gain,\" said Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga.\nLast Sunday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney gave a political assessment, saying on Fox News the issue was \"already litigated\" during the 2016 election. \"Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn't and they elected him anyway, which is, of course, what drives the Democrats crazy.\"\nWhen asked whether Democrats would ever get access to the president's tax returns, Mulvaney said: \"Never. Nor should they.\"\nBut George Yin, a tax law professor at the University of Virginia, said past case law should give the administration no leeway. \"The provision does not give any basis for the secretary of the Treasury to refuse the request,\" he said.\nHe said the provision now being invoked by Democrats appears to have been used in cases ranging from President Richard Nixon's tax returns in the 1970s to the alleged IRS targeting of conservative tax-exempt groups in the Obama administration. The evidence is circumstantial, according to Yin, since records and correspondence haven't leaked and are exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests.\nThe provision dates to 1924, when Congress was investigating scandals from the administration of President Warren G. Harding, who had died the year before. Among the scandals: Millionaire banker and investor Andrew Mellon had held on to investments when he became Treasury secretary and had allegedly used inside information to profit.\n\"The parallels between what happened that led to the creation of this law in 1924 and today's circumstances are really very close,\" Yin said.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds the image consistent with the caption, stating that the image shows Steven Mnuchin and that the caption mentions his summons to testify before Congress. However, it acknowledges the lack of visual evidence of the Congressional setting. The external validation check, conversely, reports a lack of corroborating information in the provided text regarding the specific event mentioned in the caption.  This discrepancy is significant. The internal validation relies on circumstantial evidence (Mnuchin's presence and security) to link the image to the Congressional testimony.  This is weak evidence, as the image could represent numerous other contexts where Mnuchin might be accompanied by security. While the image itself is genuine and depicts Mnuchin, the caption's assertion regarding his Congressional testimony lacks sufficient supporting evidence from the image alone and is contradicted by the external check. The confidence score is low due to this contradiction and the weakness of the internal validation's circumstantial evidence. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context due to insufficient external corroboration and weak internal support.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation suggests consistency, but external validation finds no supporting information, resulting in a low confidence and an OOC verdict due to the lack of strong evidence supporting the caption's claim."

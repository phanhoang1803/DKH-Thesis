        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows police officers attempting to arrest an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\nAs protests erupted across the United States in May 2020 after the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers, the internet was flooded with videos and photographs showing the sometimes chaotic scene.\nWhile much of this media gave genuine glimpses of these protests, a number of miscaptioned pieces of footage also made their way into the mix. The following video, for instance, was viewed millions of times as it circulated along with the claim that it showed two officers in Minnesota attempting to arrest a black man only to find out that he was an FBI agent:\nThis video, however, does not show the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. On the contrary, this video reportedly shows a police \"encounter with [a] black male\" in Rochester, Minnesota, and is unrelated to the protests in 2020.\nThis video was originally posted to Instagram by @thisisnike1 on May 31:\nIts timing coincided with the Floyd protests, but the original post included a caption explaining that this incident had been filmed \"over a year\" ago and that it involved the Rochester Minnesota Police Department. The original caption made no mention of the person in this video being an FBI agent. A version posted to YouTube by this account identified the person simply as a \"black male\":\nSomethin been telling me to hold on to this video over a year now, ok. Some days we make it home or some days we make it 6 feet deep. Imagine getting killed at home, while jogging, playing, minding your own business or just damn breathing #BeingBlackInWhiteAmerica!! This incident happened a year ago. The Minnesota police department been corrupt. Cant even smoke a damn cigarette in peace.\nSoon after this video was posted, it was re-captioned and shared along with the claim that it showed the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. It's unclear where this rumor originated. The above-displayed video makes no mention of this person being an FBI agent and when his wallet is pulled out by the police officer it does not show an FBI badge.\nThis rumor may have started with @thisisnike1, the account that originally posted the video. A screenshot supposedly showing a deleted tweet shows a message from @thisisnike1 reading \"[he is an] FBI agent.\" This appears to have been a joke, however, as this account has retweeted a number of people explaining that this person was not actually an FBI agent:\nIn sum, this video was originally shared with a caption stating that this incident took place over a year earlier (i.e., in 2019, not 2020) and that it featured an encounter between police and an unidentified black male. There's nothing in the video or the original caption indicating that this person was an FBI agent.\nWe reached out to @thisisnike1 and will update this article if more information becomes available.",

The claim in the news caption is directly refuted by the fact-check source, which details how the video's original caption and context indicate an unrelated incident from a year prior to the George Floyd protests.

    "explanation": "The provided image shows a scene involving police officers and a Black man. However, neither the image itself nor the accompanying video provides any evidence to support the claim in the caption that this event depicts the attempted arrest of an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests in 2020. \n\nInternal validation finds no visual cues to indicate the man's identity as an FBI agent or any connection to the George Floyd protests. The lack of identifying features or contextual clues in the image significantly weakens the caption's assertion. The low confidence score (3) from the internal check highlights this uncertainty. \n\nExternal validation provides strong evidence to refute the caption's claim. Fact-checking sources confirm that the video's original context and caption indicated the event occurred over a year before the George Floyd protests, involving Rochester Minnesota Police and an unidentified Black male, not an FBI agent. The high confidence score (10) and the detailed supporting points from the external check strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. \n\nThe internal and external checks are in complete agreement that the caption is inaccurate.  There is no visual evidence within the image to support the claims made in the caption, and external fact-checks decisively refute the core assertions. The discrepancy between the caption and the actual content is clear and substantial, leaving no room for doubt that the caption is significantly out of context.  The high confidence score (10) reflects the robustness of evidence from both checks that the caption inaccurately describes the event shown in the image.  The video's original caption itself clearly negates the claims in the news caption, establishing the misinformation definitively. No visual manipulation is apparent in the provided image, and the visual content matches the description in the fact-check source report.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly refute the news caption. Internal analysis finds no visual support for the claim, while external fact-checking sources definitively demonstrate that the video depicts an unrelated incident occurring well before the George Floyd protests and does not involve an FBI agent."

On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

      "explanation": "The claim is rated as \"Miscaptioned\" by Snopes.  The image is of a 12-year-old girl in Brazil with an enlarged liver and spleen, not a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man. The claim was used to spread Islamophobic rumors.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that the photograph is miscaptioned and does not depict a pregnant child. It identifies the girl as 12-years-old and suffering from liver and spleen problems, not pregnancy. The source also explicitly mentions the image was used to spread Islamophobic rumors.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original caption claiming the image depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  Internal analysis reveals that the image shows a young girl with significant abdominal distension, which is not necessarily indicative of pregnancy. The girl's age and the cause of the abdominal swelling are not definitively established in the image alone. This lack of visual evidence regarding the claim of pregnancy and the potential for other medical explanations significantly lowers the confidence in the caption's accuracy.  The external check strengthens this assessment.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking organization, explicitly rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"  Their investigation reveals the image to be that of a 12-year-old Brazilian girl suffering from an enlarged liver and spleen, not pregnancy. The deliberate misrepresentation of the image to promote Islamophobic narratives is also highlighted by Snopes. The high confidence score from the external validation (10) and the significant discrepancies between the original caption and the visual content, along with corroborating external evidence, lead to the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context.  There is no visual evidence to support the claim of pregnancy, and the external source definitively refutes it. Therefore, the caption is not merely inaccurate but is a malicious misrepresentation of the image's true context.  The original caption is a clear case of deliberate disinformation, disseminating false information with harmful intent.  The external source not only corrects the factual inaccuracies but also exposes the malicious intent behind the false claim. The combined internal and external analysis leads to a high degree of confidence (10) in the conclusion that the original caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly refute the original caption. Internal analysis finds no visual evidence of pregnancy, while external fact-checking (Snopes) confirms the image depicts a girl with a medical condition, not pregnancy, and exposes the Islamophobic motive behind the false claim."

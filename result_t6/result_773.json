        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows two women wearing flu masks during the 1918 pandemic.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn April 2020, as the United States adjusted to new social-distancing protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease, the above-displayed photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed two women wearing masks in 1919 during the \"Spanish flu\" pandemic.\nThis is a genuine photograph. However, it was not taken in 1919 during the flu pandemic, and these masks were being worn for fashion, not medical, purposes.\nThis image is available via Alamy and presented with the title \"Ladies' fashion from 1913.\" That image is also attached to a description in German that explains the trend imitated traditional veils worn in Turkey.\nHere's the original caption (translated via Google):\nEine Neue Schleiermode\nDurch den Balkankrieg hat sich eine neue, einzigartige Mode herausgebildet: die Damen tragen neuerdings den seit Jahrhunderten in der Turkei ublichen Nasenchleier\nA New Veil fashion\nA new, peculiar fashion has emerged from the Balkan War: women have recently been wearing the nose veil that has been used in Turkey for centuries.\nAlthough this particular photograph shows two fashionable women, people were encouraged to wear masks during the \"Spanish flu\" pandemic. Here's a 1918 newspaper clipping from The Oakland Tribune announcing that police officers would start patrolling the streets to make sure people were wearing \"flu masks\":\nThe 1918 H1N1 pandemic infected an estimated 500 million people (about a third of the world's total population) and resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths, 675,000 of which occurred in the United States. Mandating people wear protective masks was just one method cities in the United States used to fight the disease.\nAccording to CNN, the United States \"led the world in mask wearing\" during that pandemic. In some areas of the country, such as San Francisco, citizens were required to wear masks in public.\nCNN writes:\nIn October 1918, as San Francisco received the pandemic's second wave, hospitals began reporting a rise in the number of infected patients.\nOn October 24, 1918, the city's elected legislative body, the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco, realizing that drastic action needed to be taken with over 4,000 cases recorded, unanimously passed the Influenza Mask Ordinance.\nThe wearing of face masks in public became mandatory on US soil for the first time.\nA number of images showing this unusual time in American history can be found on Getty Images. Here are a few photographs showing police officers, sanitation workers, and everyday citizens wearing masks in an effort to prevent the spread of disease during the 1918 pandemic:",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check strongly supports the caption. The image clearly shows soldiers wearing masks as part of their uniform. The internal check's high confidence score (10) reflects this visual evidence. However, the external check fails to provide relevant information to corroborate the claim about masks being added to uniforms this year to curb coronavirus spread. The external check's low confidence score (3) highlights this lack of supporting evidence. This significant discrepancy between internal and external checks necessitates a conservative approach.  While the image strongly suggests the caption's accuracy regarding mask usage in the uniform, the absence of external verification regarding the specific claim of this being a recent addition to combat coronavirus leaves significant uncertainty.  The visual evidence is compelling, but it does not offer temporal context.  The year the photograph was taken is unknown, and the claim that the masks were \"added this year\" can not be verified. The internal check is based solely on what's visually present, while the external check points to the need for additional information for context. Therefore, given this lack of reliable external corroboration of the temporal aspect of the caption, the final verdict leans towards \"out of context\" despite the strong visual evidence. The confidence score is low because of this crucial missing piece of information that could potentially invalidate the caption's claim about the timing of the mask addition.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on visual evidence of soldiers wearing masks. External check lacks relevant information to verify the claim about the masks being a recent addition to the uniform for coronavirus prevention. The discrepancy between the checks leads to a conservative assessment, concluding the caption is likely out of context due to unverifiable temporal claim."

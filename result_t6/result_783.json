        "content": "Nigeria has dissolved the special police force at the centre of protests against police brutality.\nThe government said a special presidential directive had ordered the immediate dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars).\nProtests against the squad were sparked by a video of a man allegedly being killed by police.\nThe demonstrations have intensified despite a crackdown and have spread outside the country.\nWhat does the directive say?\nAll the officers in the Sars squad - widely accused of unlawful arrests, torture and murder - are to be redeployed, the presidency said, and a new arrangement to replace the squad is being worked on.\nMeanwhile, Nigeria's chief of police said a team of investigators - including civil society organisations and human rights bodies - would be set up to investigate alleged abuses by Sars.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

The dissolution of Sars come came with one important specification: the officers from the controversial police unit will be redeployed. It's unclear where to. That's crucial because although the protest started off as a call to disband Sars, it has expanded to include the wider Nigerian police force.\nActivists were quick to point out that the abuses carried out during the protests, including beatings, intimidation and the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators, were all carried out by policemen who did not belong to Sars.\nFor them, what's needed is a total overhaul of policing in Nigeria. It's also unclear whether any officers will be prosecuted for past abuses, something rights group Amnesty has said is crucial to ensure justice for the alleged victims.\nHow have the protests spread?\nBBC correspondents in Nigeria say clashes between anti-Sars protestors and policemen have been growing.\nMultiple eyewitnesses told the BBC they were beaten by police officers, as well as seeing others being attacked during protests on Sunday morning, Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones said.\nA young woman who had strayed from the crowd at one protest told the BBC she had been beaten by 10 policemen who broke her glasses. A BBC reporter was also stopped by the police and her mobile phone broken by an officer.\nMeanwhile the hashtag #EndSARS has been trending in Nigeria and globally, with demonstrations spreading to the UK and Canada.\nCelebrities including the Nigerian superstars Wizkid and Davido, as well as British-Nigerian Star Wars actor John Boyega, have backed the protests on social media.\nOn Sunday protesters including Wizkid gathered in central London.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

We have achieved our goal - but this is just the beginning,\" he said.\nHow did Sars operate?\nThe latest round of protests were prompted by footage of officers pulling two men out of a hotel in Lagos into the street and shooting one of them.\nThe footage, leaked to the media, provoked outrage and led many to share stories of brutality attributed to the unit, which has developed notoriety for unduly profiling young people, the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja says.\nThose considered \"flashy\" often attract the Sars officers' attention and very few walk away without having to hand over money, while others are arrested or jailed on trumped-up charges and some have been killed, our correspondent adds.\nEarlier this year rights group Amnesty said it had documented at least 82 cases of torture, ill treatment and extra-judicial execution between January 2017 and May this year.\nThe victims were mainly men aged between 18 and 35 from poor backgrounds and vulnerable groups. Many of those tortured were beaten with sticks and machetes and denied medical attention, the group said.\nThe \"systemic use of torture... points to an absolute disregard for international human rights laws and standards\", Amnesty said.\nWhy didn't reform work?\nThe #EndSARS hashtag was first thought to have been used in 2018, but it emerged once again a week ago.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a person with a haircut that says \"END SARS\" on the back of their head. This is a clear demonstration against the SARS police unit in Nigeria. The internal check correctly identifies the image as depicting a protest against SARS, but it acknowledges a lack of explicit visual confirmation of the person's nationality or precise location.  The external check strengthens the claim by referencing a source indicating that protests against SARS spread \"outside the country.\" While this source doesn't pinpoint the exact date or location of the pictured protest, the temporal alignment with the broader protest movement and the thematic consistency strongly suggest the caption's accuracy. The confidence score reflects the combined evidence: a strong internal visual correlation supporting the protest theme (END SARS), and the external source corroborating the possibility of such a protest happening in South Africa during the period of the wider protests against SARS. There's no visual evidence of manipulation, and no significant contradictions between visual and textual details. The ambiguity of the image's location doesn't negate the overall support for the caption. The image aligns with the narrative of widespread international awareness and protest against SARS, further supporting the caption's credibility. In summary, the caption is not out of context. The lack of absolute certainty regarding the precise location (South Africa vs Nigeria) and the exact date is the main reason the confidence score remains at 8, instead of a higher number, reflecting a slightly cautious approach to the claim.  However, the supporting evidence strongly suggests the claim isn't out of context, given the strong visual evidence and external corroboration pointing towards the image reflecting the broader anti-SARS movement that extended beyond Nigeria.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's claim, though the location isn't explicitly confirmed visually. The external source reinforces the possibility of Nigerians protesting SARS in South Africa during the period of the anti-SARS protests. The visual elements of the image align with the caption's narrative."

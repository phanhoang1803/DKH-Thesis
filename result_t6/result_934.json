    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows a stone with a hole, matching the description of a hag stone.  The external check provides direct evidence from a source stating that stones with holes are sometimes referred to as hag stones, witch stones, or woe stones.  Both the visual evidence and the external source corroborate the caption, resulting in a high confidence score. There are no discrepancies or uncertainties between the internal and external checks, and no indication of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The visual details perfectly align with the description provided in both the caption and the external source. Therefore, the caption is not out of context and accurately represents the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the accuracy of the caption. The image depicts a stone with a hole, consistent with the definition of a hag stone. External sources explicitly support this terminology."

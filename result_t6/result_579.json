        "content": "For over a decade Fernanda Bolivar (pictured above) has worked at the church-supported soup kitchen, named for the Roman Catholic nun who helped the poor and dying in India.\nLike many other Venezuelan shoppers, she rises at 4 a.m. to start queueing - normally for several hours - at a supermarket near the shelter with hundreds of others.\n\"I queue for hours every day because you can only get one thing one day, another the next,\" she said. \"The situation's got terrible in the last year.\"\n\"As always with these sorts of projects, the most interesting part is getting to know the individuals involved.\"\nCarlos Garcia Rawlins, Reuters Photographer\nFor a year or so now, we photographers have been illustrating Venezuelas economic crisis with photos of empty shelves and queues forming outside supermarkets. But now I wanted to do something different.\nIn search of a more intimate perspective on the story, I found out about a eating centre in Caracas that has been caring for homeless people for the last 14 years. At first, I wasnt sure if Id be able to find it. The only directions I had were: its in San Martin district, under a bridge next to some tyres.\nBut even though there was no one on the phone who could help me pinpoint the centres exact location, when I arrived in the area a strong smell of vegetable soup wafting from behind a closed door let me know I was on the right track. Sure enough, there it was: The Mother Teresa of Calcutta eating centre.\nIn a dishevelled back street of central Caracas, under a bridge, the centre houses a number of long, concrete tables and benches. It has faded indigo-blue walls and bears marks from the floods that occur regularly during the rainy season, with just a couple of lightbulbs to complement the faint stream of light from the only window in the place. Willy, the shelters resident cat, helps keep the floor clean of scraps.\nThe centres Venezuelan version of Mother Teresa is Fernanda, a warm and smiling lady, who for over a decade has been carefully preparing soup in a gigantic pot. When someone makes a special donation or the budget stretches far enough, she provides a meat dish. The food is always free, and no questions are asked of the people who come in to eat it.\nAs always with these sorts of projects, the most interesting part is getting to know the individuals involved. Spending time with the 50 or so people who fill the soup kitchen every day was a very special experience and everyone I spoke to had an amazing story.\nI wanted to take portraits of everyone I met, but to start with not many of the soup kitchens visitors were willing to be photographed or to chat with me about their personal circumstances.\nBut when the first ones agreed, I brought them a copy of their photo the next day, and it was incredible to see how they cracked up laughing at the pictures of themselves. They were so thankful when I told them that these photos were presents. One of them even had tears in his eyes when he told me that he had not seen himself for many years. After that, they all wanted pictures and eagerly compared among themselves who had and had not received a photo yet.\nAs for Fernanda, her story is remarkable too. Leaning against her kitchen surface, she told me how she had been so hungry one day that she knocked on a priests house asking for help. He gave her food and  more importantly  a job at the soup kitchen. Shes been working there ever since.\nHer biggest problem these days is finding the ingredients she needs. I stood with her outside the supermarket in the queues that form in the early morning. Hundreds of people wait for hours in these lines before the store opens, some starting before dawn, to buy whatever is in stock that day. Often, basics like rice or lentils are not available, so Fernanda has to go back the next day and queue all over again.",

    "explanation": "The image depicts a group of people sitting at long tables, eating a meal. The setting appears to be a communal dining area, possibly a soup kitchen.  The people appear to be of modest means. The internal validation notes that while a Catholic church is not explicitly visible, the scene is plausible for a soup kitchen. The external validation corroborates this interpretation by referring to a source describing a soup kitchen run by a Catholic church in Caracas that provides free meals.  Both the image and the external source support the idea of a free soup kitchen. However, neither the image nor the provided external source explicitly states the location as \"on the outskirts of Caracas.\" The image lacks any geographic indicators. Thus, there is a slight uncertainty about the exact location. While the overall scene strongly suggests a soup kitchen providing free meals, the specificity of the location needs more evidence to be fully confirmed. This is why the confidence score is only 8.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation support the core idea of the caption (people eating at a free soup kitchen). However, there's some uncertainty about the specific location mentioned in the caption ('outskirts of Caracas'), as this detail is not visually confirmed in the image and is not explicitly stated in the mentioned external source.

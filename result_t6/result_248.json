    "explanation": "The internal validation shows some alignment between the caption and the image, acknowledging the ambiguity of the scene. However, the external validation decisively refutes the caption's claim. The Financial Times article referenced does not contain any information supporting the event described in the caption.  Therefore, there's a significant discrepancy. The image depicts a horse being handled, potentially for sale or training, but lacks any clear indication of an auction or a specific location in eastern Libya. The setting looks more like a rural field or training area than an auction ground. While the image itself is internally consistent with the general idea of a horse being prepared for something, the lack of external corroboration significantly lowers the confidence in the caption's accuracy. The external check's strong negative result overrides the weaker positive result from the internal check. Due to the lack of supporting evidence and the contradictory information from the external check, we must conclude the caption is out of context. The uncertainty stems from not knowing the actual context surrounding the photograph, such as its source or any accompanying information that may support the caption.  The low confidence score reflects this significant uncertainty and the clear conflict between internal assessment and external verification.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows weak support for the caption, while external validation strongly refutes it. The lack of external evidence and the discrepancy between internal and external checks lead to a low confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

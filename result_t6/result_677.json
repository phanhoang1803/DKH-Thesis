        "content": "If you've ever voted in-person, you've been helped by a poll worker: they've checked you in and pointed you in the right direction to cast your ballot. Maybe it was your retired neighbor, even a family member or former teacher, greeting you at the polls year after year.\nThis year, many of those folks are avoiding public spaces.\nRisk of severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, and in the 2018 general election, 58% of poll workers were 61 or older, according to the Election Assistance Commission. Over a quarter of them were 71 or older.\n\"In normal circumstances, election officials find it very difficult to have enough poll workers to run elections,\" says Sylvia Albert, Director of Voting and Elections at the watchdog group Common Cause. This year, she says, \"the problem is exponentially larger.\"\nElection officials worry there won't be enough poll workers to staff polling places at sufficient levels, and if that's the case, precincts will have to be consolidated. During the primaries, for example, officials in Milwaukee reduced the number of polling places in the city from 180 to five, citing a poll worker shortage early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHere's how to sign up\nElection officials are still looking for help.\nYou can sign up to work the polls in your area through Power the Polls. Look up the requirements and even the training materials in your state or jurisdiction here, through the Fair Elections Center.\nIn many states, you need to be a registered voter to work on election day, and most voter registration deadlines are early-to-mid October.\nSign up as soon as possible. Now is probably a good time. States have already begun training their poll workers, and many aim to finish by the end of October.\nAnd here's the good news: Working the polls is a commitment  but it's not a volunteer activity. It's paid. The Fair Elections Center will tell you how much you can expect to make.\nAsk if you don't understand\nIn most states, poll workers are trained on their job duties before election day, but the exact training material varies from place to place. Ask for visual references and practice working with voting equipment if you're given the opportunity to do so.\nIf you don't understand the material, make sure to ask. Don't assume you can wing it on Election Day. It's a nationwide presidential election in the middle of a pandemic, not a statistics quiz.\nOn Election Day\nDon't forget to bring snacks and wear comfortable clothes and shoes, says Albert at Common Cause. You'll also want to bring a charger or battery backup for your phone.\nThis year, states and cities will usually supply PPE for poll workers  but, as always, bringing your own mask and taking COVID-19 precautions is a good idea, to keep people around you safe and healthy.\nDon't forget to enjoy it. You're making democracy happen.\nWe'd love to hear from you. Leave us a voicemail at 202-216-9823, or email us at LifeKit@npr.org.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation correctly identifies the image as depicting an election worker in Kinshasa, tallying votes.  However, the external validation fails to find supporting evidence, indicating a potential discrepancy. The external source focuses on US election worker recruitment, unrelated to the image's context.  The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty. The visual evidence strongly supports the internal validation, showing a person counting votes on a chalkboard marked with candidate names and tally marks. This suggests the image is from an election setting in Kinshasa. The lack of corroborating external information, however, raises concerns.  It is possible the external source is limited or the image caption is inaccurate. Without further external evidence, the caption's accuracy cannot be definitively confirmed.  Therefore, it is more prudent to err on the side of caution. It's essential to note that the internal analysis relies solely on the visual elements within the image. The external search did not yield any relevant results. This discrepancy suggests the need for further investigation using more reliable external sources like news reports or official election documentation from Kinshasa during the relevant election period.  This could involve searching for news articles, images, or reports from the time of the election, focusing on polling station activities in Kinshasa. The lack of external validation makes the confidence level low.  A deeper search with more specific keywords and using multiple search engines may be able to find supporting evidence that could increase confidence.  However, without such evidence, it is more responsible to flag the caption as possibly out of context. The presence of a chalkboard with candidatesâ€™ names and tally marks strongly suggests an election day counting process, yet the absence of corroborating external context reduces confidence in the caption's complete accuracy.",

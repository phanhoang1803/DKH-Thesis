        "content": "Martin Fayulu insists he won the vote and has demanded a manual recount, but the electoral commission declared rival Felix Tshisekedi the winner.\nTroops have deployed near Mr Fayulu's residence and outside the court.\nHe accuses Mr Tshisekedi, also an opposition candidate, of making a deal with outgoing President Joseph Kabila.\nMr Fayulu arrived on Saturday at the court.\nAnnouncing the appeal, his lawyer Feli Ekombe said, quoted by AFP: \"The petition demands the annulment of the results proclaiming Felix Tshisekedi president of the republic. It was introduced yesterday [Friday] and today we have come to get the receipts for this petition.\"\nSpeaking earlier to BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane, Mr Fayulu said: \"I will do whatever is possible for me to do to get the truth because the Congolese want change.\"\nOn Saturday, Mr Fayulu repeated that the result did not reflect \"the truth of the ballot boxes\".\nThe electoral commission also said the pro-Kabila coalition had won a majority of parliamentary seats.\nSeveral Western governments and the influential Roman Catholic Church in DR Congo have expressed surprise and concern at the declared results.\nMr Kabila has been in office for 18 years and the result, if confirmed, would create the first orderly transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.\nWhat does Fayulu say?\nDozens of Fayulu supporters had gathered outside his residence in the capital, Kinshasa, to chant slogans against Mr Kabila and Mr Tshisekedi.\nHowever they fled inside the building when the security forces arrived on Saturday, Reuters news agency reports.\nMr Fayulu admitted his court challenge would have little chance of success as the constitutional court was \"composed of Kabila's people\" but he said he did not want to give his opponents any chance to say he had not followed the law.\n\"Felix Tshisekedi has been nominated by Mr Kabila to perpetuate the Kabila regime. Because today the boss is Kabila,\" Mr Fayulu said.\n\"Mr Kabila cannot stay and make an arrangement with someone who will not have any power... Mr Tshisekedi knows himself that he did not win.\"\nMr Fayulu said he feared there would be violence if the electoral commission did not give the true figures \"polling station by polling station\" and that it was the right of all Congolese to demonstrate according to the law.\nHas there been any violence?\nThousands of supporters of Mr Tshisekedi took to the streets to celebrate but those who backed Mr Fayulu also came out in protest.\nViolent scenes were reported in Kikwit, where at least two policemen and two civilians were said to have been killed.\nThere were reports of several hundred students protesting against the result and being dispersed by tear gas in the town of Mbandaka.\nProtests were also reported in Kisangani but the south, where Mr Tshisekedi has broad support, was mainly celebrating.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged all sides \"to refrain from violence\" and widespread unrest has not yet been reported.\nWhat was the result of the election?\nAccording to the National Electoral Commission (Ceni), Mr Tshisekedi received 38.5% of the vote in the 30 December election.\nThe full results were:\nFelix Tshisekedi - 7 million votes\nMartin Fayulu - 6.4 million votes\nEmmanuel Shadary - 4.4 million votes\nTurnout was reported to be 48%.\nWhat could happen next?\nCandidates must file any appeal to the constitutional court within 48 hours of the announcement of the provisional results.\nJudges will then have seven days to deliberate.\nConstitutional expert Jacques Ndjoli told the BBC there were three possible outcomes: the court could confirm Mr Tshisekedi's victory, order a recount, or cancel the results altogether and call fresh elections.",

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions celebrations by Tshisekedi supporters and protests by Fayulu supporters in various locations, including Kinshasa. However, it does not explicitly state that residents celebrated in Kinshasa on Thursday *after* the election results were announced. The celebrations are mentioned in the context of the overall reactions to the results, without specific timing details.  The news source mentions that thousands of Tshisekedi supporters celebrated, but there is no direct evidence explicitly confirming the celebration happened on Thursday specifically.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the image depicts residents celebrating in Kinshasa, Congo, on Thursday after election results were announced.  Internal validation reveals several discrepancies. While the image shows a celebratory street scene at night, it lacks definitive evidence to confirm the location as Kinshasa or the specific date as Thursday.  The temporal information (Thursday) is missing from the visual evidence.  External validation further weakens the caption's accuracy. Although news reports mention celebrations by Tshisekedi supporters and protests by Fayulu supporters in various locations including Kinshasa, no source explicitly states that the celebrations shown in this specific image occurred in Kinshasa on a Thursday following the election announcement.  The news sources do mention widespread celebrations among Tshisekedi's supporters, but don't provide specific temporal or locational information to verify the image's caption.  Therefore, both internal and external validations demonstrate a lack of sufficient evidence to support the original caption's claim. The discrepancies between the caption and the available evidence, combined with the low confidence scores from both internal (3) and external (4) checks, lead to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations fail to support the claim that the image depicts residents celebrating in Kinshasa, Congo, on Thursday after election results.  The image lacks definitive locational and temporal information, and external sources don't provide specific details to verify the caption's claims, despite reporting on related celebrations and protests."

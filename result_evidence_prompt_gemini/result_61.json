        "content": "Claim:\nIn late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed whereby motorists were tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the road, as part of a prevalent sex-trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Yall See Anything Like This, Dont Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Dont Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption, \"Sex Traffickers in Florida Trick Motorists By Lying in the Road,\" is out of context and inaccurate.  The internal check found no evidence within the image itself to support the claim of sex trafficking. The image shows a person lying on a road at night, near a car, but this is insufficient to conclude anything about sex trafficking. The internal check's low confidence score (3) reflects this lack of direct evidence. \n\nThe external check, however, provides significantly stronger evidence against the caption's claim. It references a Snopes article that directly investigates this claim. The Snopes investigation involved contacting law enforcement agencies (Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Tampa Police Department, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office) and an expert from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.  None of these sources found any evidence supporting the widespread use of this tactic by sex traffickers.  The Snopes article clearly states that there is no evidence of a pattern of such incidents. The high confidence score (8) of the external check reflects the thoroughness of the investigation and the lack of corroborating evidence. \n\nThe high confidence score (9) of the overall assessment stems from the combination of a weak internal check and a strong, well-supported external check.  There is no conflict between the checks; they both point to the falsity of the caption. The external check provides a thorough and credible investigation, effectively debunking the claim.  The lack of evidence in the image itself does not contradict the results of the Snopes investigation. The image could simply depict an accident, an intoxicated person, or another unrelated event.  Crucially, the absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence.  The external validation's extensive investigation into law enforcement records and expert opinions demonstrates that such a tactic, even if possible in isolated cases, is not a recognized or common method used by sex traffickers.\n\nIn summary,  the caption's claim is unsupported by the image and decisively refuted by an external investigation.  There is no reasonable basis to conclude that the image depicts sex traffickers employing this specific method.  The caption is strongly misleading and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate the caption is false. The image lacks evidence of sex trafficking, and an external investigation by Snopes found no supporting evidence from law enforcement or experts."

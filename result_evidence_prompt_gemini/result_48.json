According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\nRobs a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com  where the story originated  clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

      "explanation": "The news caption is largely supported by Source 1, which details a hoax news article about a 29-year-old Calgary man injuring his lower body while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke.  While the source explicitly states the incident is a hoax, the factual elements of the caption (age, location, nature of injury, and method) closely match the details presented in the hoax article. The discrepancy is that the caption presents the story as factual news while the source clarifies its fictional nature.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check reveals a low confidence score (7) due to the lack of visual evidence in the image confirming the location as Calgary.  The image depicts an incident involving injuries and emergency personnel, but doesn't offer any location-specific details.  The external check, however, yields a higher confidence score (8) because it identifies a source (Source 1) that corroborates the main points of the caption: a 29-year-old individual in Calgary suffering lower-body injuries after an attempt to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke. This source, though, clarifies that the incident is a hoax. The conflict arises between the caption's presentation of the event as factual news and the source's revelation of its fictional nature.  While the external source aligns with most elements of the caption, the crucial difference regarding the veracity of the event leads to a conclusion of the caption being out of context. The high confidence score of 8 reflects the substantial overlap between the caption's factual elements and the information in Source 1, even though Source 1 reveals the story to be a hoax.  The internal check's lower confidence score is considered, but the external check, supported by a source, carries more weight in determining the overall context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags low confidence due to lack of visual location confirmation in the image. External check shows high confidence based on a source aligning with the caption's details but reveals the story is a hoax.  Discrepancy in veracity leads to OOC conclusion."

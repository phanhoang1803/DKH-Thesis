On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

Snopes states that the photograph is miscaptioned and shows a 12-year-old girl with an enlarged liver and spleen, not a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man. The Snopes article details the origin of the image and its misuse to spread Islamophobic rumors.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes article directly refutes the claim, stating the image is miscaptioned and does not depict a pregnant 9-year-old girl. It identifies the girl in the image as 12-year-old Sandy from Brazil, suffering from an enlarged liver and spleen.",

    "explanation": "The caption's claim that the image depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal analysis reveals a significant lack of evidence within the image itself to support the caption's assertions. The image shows a young girl with a distended abdomen, but this could be due to various medical conditions, not necessarily pregnancy. Crucially, the image provides no information about the girl's age, the cause of her abdominal distention, or the identity or religious affiliation of any potential perpetrator. This inherent ambiguity severely undermines the caption's credibility. The low confidence score (3) from the internal check reflects this uncertainty.\n\nThe external validation, however, provides strong and conclusive evidence to refute the caption's claims.  The Snopes fact-check explicitly debunks the narrative, identifying the image as a misrepresentation.  Snopes clarifies that the photograph is of a 12-year-old Brazilian girl, Sandy, who suffers from an enlarged liver and spleen. This completely contradicts the caption's narrative of a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man.  The high confidence score (10) from the external check reflects the weight of evidence from this reliable source.\n\nThere is a clear and stark disagreement in the numerical confidence scores between the internal (3) and external (10) checks.  However, the external validation from Snopes carries significantly more weight due to its investigation and access to verifiable information.  The internal analysis is limited by the visual information alone, lacking any contextual data to definitively support or refute the claims. Therefore, the external evidence from a credible source like Snopes decisively overrides the ambiguity and uncertainty presented by the internal visual analysis. The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the high-confidence external evidence that directly refutes the caption's claims.\n\nIn summary, the overwhelming weight of evidence, particularly from the Snopes fact-check, leads to the conclusion that the original caption is completely out of context. The image does not depict what the caption claims, and the caption serves to perpetuate a false and harmful narrative.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the certainty achieved through the combination of internal assessment and the definitive external verification.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. Internal analysis finds insufficient evidence within the image to support the caption's claims, while external fact-checking definitively refutes the narrative, revealing the image's true context and debunking the false claims."

That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The caption claims that the FBI raided the CDC to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism.  Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check analyzes the image itself. The image depicts the CDC building, but there is no visual evidence of an FBI raid or any activity suggesting such an event.  The absence of any indication of a raid, coupled with the presence of the CDC building, creates a strong internal inconsistency. The confidence score of 8 reflects this high degree of internal inconsistency.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation leverages external sources to verify the claim. The external check explicitly identifies the claim as a hoax, citing a source that debunks the claim's veracity. The source directly refutes the narrative presented in the caption.  The high confidence score of 10 highlights the strong evidence from this external source, which firmly establishes the falsity of the claim. \n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both independently and strongly suggest that the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  Both assessments point towards the caption being false. The high confidence scores from both (8 and 10) reinforce this conclusion.\n\nEntity Analysis:\nThe entities mentioned in the caption are: \"FBI\", \"CDC\", \"vaccines\", and \"autism\". The image contains only the CDC building. The caption mentions the FBI's involvement in an action (raid) and the existence of data linking vaccines to autism. None of these elements are present in the image. The lack of visual evidence internally and the explicit external debunking of the claim strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on both the internal and external validation results, which show a strong and consistent agreement that the claim is false, and because the image does not support the caption's narrative, the final conclusion is that the caption is out of context. The combined confidence score reflects the strong evidence supporting this conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is false and out of context. The image lacks any evidence of an FBI raid, and external sources explicitly label the claim as a hoax."

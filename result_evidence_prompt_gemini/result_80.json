        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton got her wish that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought.\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, its an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

      "explanation": "The claim that Hillary Clinton wished for someone like Donald Trump to run for office is rated as \"Miscaptioned\" by Snopes.  The evidence shows a meme falsely attributed a quote to Hillary Clinton.  While the photo is real, the quote is fabricated.  The evidence directly addresses and debunks the claim in the news caption.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes article debunks the claim, stating the quote is fabricated and the meme is miscaptioned.  It identifies the claim as a variation of a false claim from 2016, citing multiple news sources confirming the real photo and debunking the quote.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the accuracy of the caption based solely on the presence of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the image. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  The external check, with a confidence score of 8, utilizes Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, to debunk the claim that Hillary Clinton wished for someone like Donald Trump to run for office.  Snopes provides evidence demonstrating that the quote attributed to Hillary Clinton is fabricated and part of a misleading meme.  This directly contradicts the caption's assertion.  The high confidence scores from both checks highlight a critical conflict. While the image itself is authentic, depicting both individuals together, the caption's contextual meaning – Hillary Clinton's supposed wish regarding Trump's candidacy – is demonstrably false according to the external validation. This conflict forces a reevaluation. The external validation's evidence is strong and directly addresses the core claim of the caption, making it more reliable than the purely visual internal validation. The high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong external evidence debunking the claim and the internal evidence only confirming the image's content, which is not enough to support the caption's meaning.  The core issue is not the presence of the individuals, but the assertion about Hillary Clinton's desire. Because the external check directly refutes the central claim of the caption, and provides verifiable evidence (a Snopes article) to support its findings, we label the caption as out of context. The discrepancy is significant: the image depicts a moment in time, while the caption adds an unsupported and false interpretation of Clinton’s intentions, based on a fabricated quote. The conflict is resolved by prioritizing the externally validated information, which is crucial for assessing the accuracy of the caption's meaning, not just its visual description.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check validates the presence of Clinton and Trump in the image. External check, using Snopes, proves the caption's claim about Clinton's wish to be false.  High confidence in both checks reveals a significant conflict, resolved by prioritizing the strong external evidence debunking the caption's core claim."

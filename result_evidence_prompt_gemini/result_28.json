      "explanation": "The image shows a hyperrealistic skin mask being worked on, which aligns with the caption's description of humanoid robots with hyperrealistic skin being developed.  The location is not directly visible but the caption's mention of Vladivostok, Russia is consistent with news reports of Promobot's activities.  While we don't see the full robot, the mask strongly suggests the caption's claim.",

      "explanation": "Promobot is a known manufacturer of service robots.  The development of humanoid robots with increasingly realistic skin is a plausible technological advancement. While I cannot independently verify the specific development in Vladivostok, the overall claim aligns with known trends in robotics and Promobot's activities. The statement lacks specific details that would require external verification, such as project timelines or images. Therefore, I assess the news caption as generally plausible, but with a lower confidence score due to the lack of readily available corroborating evidence for this specific development location.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's claim, although neither provides definitive proof. The internal check notes the image shows a hyperrealistic skin mask, consistent with the caption's description of humanoid robots with hyperrealistic skin. The external check confirms Promobot's existence and work in service robotics, making the development of such robots plausible. However, neither check offers concrete evidence linking the specific mask in the image to Promobot's Vladivostok branch. The lack of precise details and independent verification lowers the confidence score.  The image's focus on a single component (the mask) could suggest that the caption may be slightly overstating the level of development.  It's possible the image shows a part of a larger project or that the development is at a preliminary stage.  Therefore, while the caption aligns reasonably well with the information available and is not demonstrably false, more information is needed to achieve a higher confidence score.  The alignment between the internal assessment (confidence 8) and the external assessment (confidence 8) reinforces this moderate confidence level. There are no significant discrepancies to resolve. The absence of direct evidence linking the mask in the image to the specific claim about Promobot's Vladivostok branch leads to the slight adjustment in the overall confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's core claim, but lack definitive proof. The image shows a component consistent with the described technology, and Promobot's activities make the claim plausible.  However, the lack of direct verification of the specific location and development stage lowers confidence."

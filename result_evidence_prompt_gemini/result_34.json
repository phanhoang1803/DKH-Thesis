Clicking through on the social media post led users to a rogue website which displayed a fake CNN video announcing the supposed \"shocking\" death of the Smiths (along with some other adult content):\nThe purpose of this hoax appeared to be to bait users into clicking to view the video as a means of driving them to malicious web pages, and to trick them into sharing the hoax post on social media in order to spread it further. Users are strongly advised not to visit to the website that underlies this hoax post and not to click on anything displayed there.",

The source explicitly states that the claim was a hoax and that neither Will nor Jaden Smith died or were injured in a car accident. The source also explains that the hoax was spread through social media and linked to malicious websites.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds a discrepancy between the image (showing Will and Jaden Smith together at an event) and the caption (claiming their death in a car crash).  The confidence score of 10 reflects the high certainty of this discrepancy.  The external check further reinforces this by citing a reliable source (Snopes.com) that explicitly debunks the death claim as a hoax.  The external check also achieves a confidence score of 10 due to the direct refutation from a reputable source and its detailed explanation of how the hoax was spread. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks, both pointing towards a false and out-of-context caption. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) further strengthen the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and unrelated to the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm the caption is out of context. The image shows Will and Jaden Smith alive, while the caption falsely reports their death in a car accident.  A reputable source debunks this claim as a hoax."

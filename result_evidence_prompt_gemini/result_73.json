        "content": "The Avenue Salongo is the Champs-lyses of Mbuji-Mayi, residents say. The comparison is an optimistic one. There is little that unites this strip of pitted tarmac, with its pair of faltering streetlights and sweltering central African humidity, with the famously beautiful Parisian boulevard  other than the French language spoken on both.\nThe Avenue Salongos only hotel is the Metropole, where paunchy political fixers drink strong beer in a salon bar furnished with much smoked glass and heavy fake leather furniture. Opposite is a row of diamond dealers, where local artisanal diggers sell stones scrabbled from red earth in makeshift mines among the verdant hills around the city. An understocked pharmacy, a restaurant selling grilled offal and the Couture de la Paix dress shop complete the scene.\nLast week, however, the DRCs third-largest city enjoyed a day that was one of the most exciting anyone could remember for a long time, triggered by the arrival of one of the main opposition candidates in forthcoming presidential elections.\nThis vast resource-rich country  with its population of 80 million spread over an area the size of western Europe  will go to the polls in seven days. The DRC has never known a peaceful transition of power since its hasty independence from Belgium in 1960. The fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 triggered a civil war in which four million died. Joseph Kabila, the president, has been in power since his father, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.\nThe forthcoming polls have inspired both great trepidation  and great hope. We need a change, a big change. We live so badly, said Angela, 21, a student. Angela, who did not want to give her family name for fear of attracting ennuis or troubles, had walked across the city to the Avenue Salongo very early in the morning to greet opposition candidate Flix Tshisekedi. She had first tried to reach the airport on the outskirts of Mbuji-Mayi, but had turned back when police clashed with stone-throwing youths and a teenager was shot dead. I am best here. I will wait for him. He is our president. He is worth it, Angela said.\nMbuji-Mayi is the capital of the province of Kasai-Oriental. Tshisekedi is from the region, and this is his stronghold. His father, Etienne Tshisekedi, was a famous opposition leader under Mobutu. He died last year and his son has inherited his party, and with it a slim chance of winning power.\nNo one doubts the problems any president of the DRC will face. The country is one of the poorest in the world, wracked by war and disease. Inequality is off the charts with wealthy grosses legumes  or fat cats  driving Jaguars over the potholes of streets in the capital Kinshasa. Huge sums earned from mining contracts disappearing into the pockets of those close to le pouvoir, or power elite.\nIn the east, scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines and an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. In the Kasais  the name given to the provinces around Mbuji-Mayi  the grass is yet to grow over the mass graves left by a conflict between rebels and government forces in which thousands died between 2016 and last summer.\nAcross the country, aid agencies estimate that 4.3 million people are displaced. In the rolling valleys around Mbuji-Maya, half the children may be malnourished. Cholera has killed hundreds since 2016.\nThe countrys manifold problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago. Only under fierce pressure from neighbouring and nearby powers, particularly Angola and South Africa, did he agree not to stand in the coming polls, even if he is constitutionally barred from serving three consecutive terms. He was very unhappy, very angry and resentful, said one diplomat close to the negotiations with Kabila. Instead, the ruling coalition picked the little-known interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, as its candidate.\nIn Kinshasa, aides insisted Shadary was his own man. Our candidate was chosen by a broad cross section of Congolese society. He has his own programme and personality, said a spokesperson.\nThe opposition has been weakened by internal arguments and the exclusion by the electoral commission of two political heavyweights: Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord, and Mose Katumbi, a popular tycoon.\nCritics say Tshisekedi is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. His father was a man of the country. The son is very limited, said Valentin Mubake, a former secretary-general of Tshisekedis Union for Democracy and Social Progress.\nIf the campaign has been largely peaceful so far, the opposition and some observers fear massive fraud. In Mbuji-Mayi few have much faith in the system. Here they are going to vote 100% for Tshisekedi but we know that if he got 100% in the elections, they would never let us win. Any time we raise our heads, they force us back down again, said Dr Marie-Albert Tshizemba, a senior health official.\nMany are worried about new electronic voting machines. Not only are these impractical in the harsh conditions of the DRC, where electricity is unreliable or non-existent, but they could be vulnerable to manipulation, opposition leaders claim.\nLast week 7,000 voting machines in Kinshasa were destroyed in a suspected arson attack, stoking fears of interference. A result seen as illegitimate by much of the population might lead to protests, violence and even war. Imagine what would happen if there was chaos here. Imagine Libya but on the scale of the Congo. Imagine what that would do to the region, to the continent, said Mubake.\nYet such fears did not dampen the enthusiasm for Tshisekedi in Mbuji-Mayi. Through the morning, despite the continuing reports of further delays to the candidates arrival, crowds continued to gather on the Avenue Salongo, singing in praise of their hero.\nBy early afternoon, hundreds of young people were running and singing in rhythm along the road. Some carried palm fronds. Armed police watched nonchalantly. Something has to change. Life is too hard. Theres no clean water, power. Most of us here dont have enough to eat. The prices are double what they were a year ago. We struggle, said Joseph Kabula, a trader who supports his wife and two small children by selling mobile phones he fetches from Kinshasa, 800 miles away.\nFinally, in the early evening, with the crowds now thick all along the Avenue Salongo, sirens are heard, music and cheering. The candidate is on his way. Sitting on the cab of an SUV, Tshisekedi is smiling, bespectacled, rotund, sweating. He waves and then is swept away among supporters surging down the road. He is going to save us. I know it. He is our saviour. He will bring light into our darkness, Angela says, when the noise and crowds have subsided.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image's content, which clearly depicts Felix Tshisekedi. However, the external check has low confidence (3) because it could not verify the claim of more than seven million votes from reliable sources.  The external check found that available sources discuss Tshisekedi's candidacy and public sentiment, but do not corroborate the specific vote count.  This discrepancy highlights a significant issue. The image alone cannot verify the exact number of votes; it only shows Tshisekedi in a setting suggestive of a political event.  The lack of external validation for the key numerical claim significantly weakens the caption's overall accuracy.  While the image aligns internally with the subject, the absence of external evidence for the crucial vote count makes the caption likely out of context. Therefore, a conservative approach is taken, prioritizing the lack of external evidence, which results in a lower overall confidence score and a judgment that the caption is out of context.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the veracity of the vote count reported in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check supports the caption's entity alignment (Tshisekedi) and context (electoral setting), but external check fails to verify the vote count. This conflicting evidence leads to a low confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nSetting your Apple device's date to 1 January 1970 will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.\nIn February 2016, a rumor began to spread that iPhones and iPads contain a nifty Easter egg: If you set the date of your Apple product to 1 January 1970 then reboot, it will bring up a retro-themed menu based on the old Apple computer operating systems.\nText on the image read:\nBlast from the past\nThe original Macintosh introduced the world to computers, forever changing the way people experience technology, and allowing people to do things that were never possible before. With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, its a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phones date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablets operating system that youll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so theres not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, its possible  at least in theory  that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says its looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.",

While the caption mentions a retro-themed Easter egg, the source states that setting the date to January 1, 1970, will likely damage the device and is not an intended feature or Easter egg.

    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows an iPhone with the date set to January 1, 1970, aligning with the caption's mention of this date. However, the external validation check provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim (confidence score of 2).  Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks the notion that setting the date to January 1, 1970, reveals a retro-themed Easter egg.  Instead, it highlights that this action risks damaging the device.  This discrepancy necessitates careful analysis.  The high internal confidence stems from a straightforward visual match; the image shows what the caption describes.  The low external confidence comes from a reliable source explicitly refuting the caption's core claim about the Easter egg.  Given the conflicting evidence, the external evidence holds more weight due to the source's credibility and specific refutation of the claim.  The claim is presented as a hoax by Snopes, indicating its inaccuracy. The visual agreement is not enough to outweigh this substantial contradictory evidence from a reliable source. Therefore, the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows a high degree of alignment between the image and caption. However, external validation from Snopes.com strongly refutes the caption's central claim, labeling it as a hoax. The external evidence outweighs the internal observation. The caption is deemed out of context."

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy because the woman in the image is wearing green and white, colors reminiscent of the Nigerian flag, and she is participating in a celebration. However, the external check has low confidence (score 4) because while it confirms the celebrations at Abuja's Eagle Square, it doesn't corroborate the specific detail about the woman's attire being in the colors of the Nigerian flag.  The conflict arises because the internal check focuses solely on the image content, while the external check relies on additional information about the event's context.  The low external confidence score outweighs the high internal confidence score. This discrepancy highlights a limitation: the image itself doesn't explicitly confirm the woman's outfit represents the Nigerian flag; it's an interpretation.  Without additional evidence verifying the woman's attire, we cannot definitively confirm that aspect of the caption.  Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is possibly out of context because a key detail lacks external validation. The final confidence score reflects this uncertainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check validates the woman's participation in a celebration and her green and white attire. External check confirms the location and event but does not corroborate the detail about her outfit representing the Nigerian flag.  Discrepancy between internal and external checks results in a low confidence assessment and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy regarding Martin Fayulu's presence and role. The external check, while supporting the core claim of Fayulu's election challenge, expresses some uncertainty (confidence score of 8) about the precise details of his demands, requiring additional verification from news sources.  This discrepancy stems from the fact that the image alone does not definitively show the specific demand of a manual recount. While the image strongly suggests Fayulu's involvement in protesting the election results,  the caption's precise wording (\"manual recount\") is not directly confirmed by the visual evidence. Therefore, there's a slight incongruence.  The overall confidence score is lowered to 8 to reflect the external verification's uncertainty about the specificity of Fayulu's demands. Even with high internal confidence, the external check's caveat necessitates this adjustment.  The external check's focus on verifying the claim against verifiable news reports highlights a crucial aspect of caption validation: it's not enough to internally align entities; the claim needs external corroboration.  The claim is plausible, considering the historical context of the 2018 DRC elections, but without access to and review of specific news sources referencing Fayulu's precise demand for a manual recount at that specific time, a degree of doubt remains.  The image itself is contextual, showing Fayulu surrounded by what appears to be security personnel, suggesting a contested situation, but it doesn't offer explicit proof of his demand for a manual recount.  In essence, while the image is consistent with the central idea of Fayulu contesting the election results, the detailed claim about the type of challenge needs further validation beyond the image's scope.  Therefore, classifying the caption as slightly out of context, reflecting a discrepancy between the image's general context and the specific detail in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the image's alignment with the caption's core claim about Martin Fayulu. External check partially supports the claim but raises concerns about the specificity of the \"manual recount\" detail, needing further verification.  Discrepancy is present, leading to a slightly lower confidence score and classification as out of context due to the lack of explicit visual confirmation for the specific detail."

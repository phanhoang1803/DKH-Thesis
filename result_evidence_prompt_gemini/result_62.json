The caption mentions Brazil, and while there is nothing in the image to confirm or deny the location is Brazil, the setting appears to be a tropical or subtropical environment, which is consistent with parts of Brazil.  Therefore, I am confident that the caption's entity \"Brazil\" is at least plausible.",

This video has been shared with a variety of claims. In some postings, this anaconda is listed as 50 feet long. In others, it's labeled as a more reasonable 10 meters (about 32 feet long):\nThis video has been severely distorted to make this snake appear much larger. While we can't say for certain just how big this snake really was, we can say that the snake appears much smaller than 10 meters long in the unedited version of this video.\nThe unedited version of this viral video has been circulating online since at least April 2018. While that video did not contain much information about where the footage was taken, the video's description was written in Portuguese, which is spoken by the majority of Brazilians.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ti6s_UStUc&feature=emb_title\nThe viral version of this video was stretched to make it appear as if his anaconda (and this \"river\") were much larger than they were in reality. The title of this video, \"sucuri gigante atravessando a estrada\" or \"giant anaconda crossing the road,\" also gives us some more context to help determine this snake's size. While the viral version of this video appears to show a \"50-foot snake\" crossing a wide river, it's clear that this video actually shows a snake crossing a flooded road.",

      "explanation": "Source 1 directly addresses a video depicting a large snake in Brazil.  While the caption mentions a \"snare,\" the evidence focuses on a video claiming to show an anaconda. The source explicitly states that a video showing a snake swimming in a river in Brazil is being shared with exaggerated claims about its size. The claim of a 10-meter-long anaconda is rated as false, and the source explains that the video was manipulated to make the snake appear larger than it is.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's plausibility, primarily focusing on the visual alignment of a large snake in a water body, which is consistent with the caption's description.  The mention of Brazil in the caption is considered plausible due to the tropical setting. However, the external check, while also indicating a high confidence score (8), reveals crucial information contradicting the caption's claim of an unusually large snake. The external source directly addresses the video, stating it's been manipulated to exaggerate the snake's size. The source explicitly debunks the claim of a 10-meter-long anaconda, indicating the snake's actual size is much smaller. This discrepancy between the internal perception of a large snake and the external confirmation of size manipulation leads to the conclusion that the caption, while not entirely false in its visual description, misrepresents the size of the snake, thereby being out of context. The external source's focus on the video's manipulation heavily weighs against the caption's implied claim of an unusually large snake. Therefore, despite the high confidence scores from both checks, the external evidence convincingly shows that the caption's claim about the snake's size is inaccurate, ultimately leading to the 'out of context' judgment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the visual alignment of the caption and image. However, external check reveals video manipulation, contradicting the caption's claim of an unusually large snake.  The external evidence prioritizes because it directly addresses the video's claims."

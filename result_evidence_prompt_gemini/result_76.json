Nicholas Mercurio, a spokesman for the service.\nThe uniform graphic being shared on social media is not an official U.S. Space Force uniform design concept, Mercurio told Task & Purpose. The Space Force service dress uniform is still in development.",

    "explanation": "The internal check, based solely on the image, suggests the caption accurately reflects the image's content: a graphic depicting dress uniform concepts for the U.S. Space Force.  However, the external check, using information from Snopes, directly contradicts this assessment. Snopes confirms that the Space Force explicitly stated the uniform design is not official and is not under consideration for adoption.  This creates a significant discrepancy. The high confidence score of the internal check is overridden by the strong external evidence.  The external validation's confidence score is significantly lower because the external source relies on the statement of a Space Force spokesperson.  However, it is strong in terms of indicating the original caption is false.  Considering the explicit denial from the Space Force, the caption is out of context. The evidence demonstrates a clear conflict where the visual content is deceptive (or at least misleading) in suggesting official consideration, while external verification definitively refutes it. The weight is given to the external check because it provides direct evidence from the official source, correcting the misinterpretation based solely on the image content. While the image may show plausible uniform designs, the lack of official status renders the original caption misleading and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check suggests the caption aligns with the image content.  External check, citing official Space Force statements, proves the caption is inaccurate.  External evidence overrides internal assessment, indicating the caption is out of context."

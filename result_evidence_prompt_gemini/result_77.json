Hawns shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse search of the image shows it to be doctored, and PolitiFact previously reported on this same photo in November 2018, rating it Pants on Fire.\nThe original photo was taken in September 2015, while the two actors were walking in Los Angeles, according to an article from PopSugar. The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russells shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts. A reverse image search found the photo to be doctored. We rate this Pants on Fire.",

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook page that posted the photo did not immediately respond to a message asking for evidence for its claim.\nAn image search shows the photo is doctored.\nThe photo was taken of the couple years ago while Hawn and Russell were out in Los Angeles, according to a September 2015 PopSugar article. They can be seen walking together, holding hands and wearing the same outfits the altered photo shows them in  only without American flags or references to Trump or ISIS on their white shirts.\nIts not the first time Russell has been tied to Trump in viral social media posts. An image recently circulated on Facebook with a quote from Russell praising Trump. We rated that Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nAn altered photo attempts to depict Russell and Hawn as Trump supporters, by adding \"Trump 2016,\" American flags and more to their shirts. An image search quickly shows those arent the original outfits the couple was wearing.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!",

    "explanation": "The internal check claims with high confidence (score 10) that the image shows Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wearing Donald Trump t-shirts.  However, the external check, also with high confidence (score 10), contradicts this assertion.  External sources (Politifact and Snopes) definitively state that the image is digitally fabricated; the original image predates the Trump imagery added to the shirts. The external evidence provides detailed explanations of how the image was altered and shows the original image without any Trump-related content.  The high confidence scores from both internal and external checks highlight a significant conflict.  Entity analysis resolves this conflict in favor of the external check's findings. The internal check's assessment is based solely on a visual analysis of the manipulated image, which fails to account for digital alteration.  The external check's conclusion is based on thorough investigation, reverse image searches, and cross-referencing with reputable fact-checking websites. Since multiple independent sources corroborate the claim that the image is doctored, the external validation is strongly preferred. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the original caption is out of context because it describes an image which is digitally manipulated and doesn't reflect reality.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check asserts the image shows Hawn and Russell wearing Trump shirts (confidence 10). External check strongly refutes this, stating the image is doctored (confidence 10).  External evidence from fact-checking sites is decisive, proving the image is a digital fabrication.  The high confidence from both checks highlights the direct conflict, but external verification wins due to its robustness and verification through reliable sources."

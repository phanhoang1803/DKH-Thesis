        "content": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP)  Zimbabwes powerful vice president said the government will block a university scholarship for young LGBTQ+ people, a move that human rights groups described Friday as a perpetuation of the African countrys homophobic practices.\nThe state university scholarship for people between the ages of 18 and 35 is sponsored by GALZ, a membership organization for LGBTQ+ people in Zimbabwe. The association started offering it in 2018 without incident. But a recent online advertisement inviting applications attracted a harsh response from Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, a self-proclaimed devout Catholic and former army commander.\nIn a strongly worded statement Thursday night, Chiwenga claimed the scholarship was a direct challenge to the governments authority.\nOur schools and institutions of higher learning will not entertain applicants, let alone enroll persons associated with such alien, anti-life, un-African and un-Christian values which are being promoted and cultivated by, as well as practiced in decadent societies with whom we share no moral or cultural affinities, he said.\nGALZ has previously said the scholarship seeks to provide equal access to state universities for LGBTQ+ people who are often ostracized by their families and struggle to pay for higher education. It did not comment on the vice presidents statement.\nHowever, a coalition of human rights groups that GALZ belongs to said it demonstrated that sexual and gender minorities are endangered in Zimbabwe.\nWe are extremely concerned about the statement from the second-highest office in the land because it exhibits intolerance, especially taking into account that the advertisement opens young people to so many opportunities, Wilbert Mandinde, the programs coordinator at Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, told The Associated Press on Friday.\nLike many African countries, Zimbabwe has laws criminalizing homosexual activity. Sex between men carries a potential sentence of up to a year in prison, and the countrys constitution bans same-sex marriages.\nChiwenga said Zimbabwes anti-gay laws make any (scholarship) offers predicated on the same aberrations both unlawful and criminal, and a grave and gross affront on our national values and ethos as a Christian nation.\nHe said the government will not hesitate to take appropriate measures to enforce national laws, adding that young people should never be tempted to trade or sell their souls for such abominable and devilish offers.\nZimbabwe has a history of discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people. Former President Robert Mugabe, who ruled the southern African nation for 37 years, once described them as worse than dogs and pigs and unworthy of legal rights.\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power following a 2017 coup led by Chiwenga when he was still an army general, has been less publicly vocal in his anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. But Chiwengas threat to ban the scholarship highlights the continued hostility from authorities and sections of society, including influential religious groups, remains.\nIn December, Zimbabwes Catholic bishops, like many of their African counterparts, cautioned against the Pope Francis declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples, citing respect of the law of the land, our culture and for moral reasons.\nZimbabwe has in the past stopped public acts that may appear to demonstrate approval of gay people.\nIn 2021, a planned visit by a gay South African celebrity, Somizi Mhlongo, for the reopening of a trendy Zimbabwean restaurant was canceled after a Christian sect and members of the ruling ZANU-PF partys youth wing vowed to block his appearance.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. However, the external check reveals a complete lack of supporting evidence (score 0), indicating the caption is likely fabricated or mismatched. The internal check relies solely on visual interpretation of the image, which might be misleading without external verification. The external check's absence of supporting evidence strongly suggests that the caption is not related to any real-world event or news report, creating a significant conflict.  Given the stark contrast between the internal and external checks, the overall confidence score is low (score 1).  There is insufficient information to confirm the caption's accuracy without external sources confirming coffin makers in Harare, Zimbabwe, engaging in the activities depicted. The discrepancy highlights the importance of corroborating visual information with reliable external sources.  The lack of corroborating evidence makes it highly probable that the caption is out of context.  Therefore, the final verdict is OOC: true.",

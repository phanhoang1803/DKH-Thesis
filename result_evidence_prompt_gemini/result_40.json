        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that \"Some 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\"  Snopes rates this claim as \"False.\" While the evidence mentions that Florida election officials sent a list of 53,000 deceased individuals to counties for removal from voter rolls, it explicitly states that this occurred as part of an ongoing effort to clean up the rolls. It also highlights that this list was generated by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files for the first time.  The claim in the news caption conflates this routine process with the false claim that those 53,000 dead people had actually voted in the election. The Snopes article debunks the notion that the deceased individuals had cast votes.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows a plausible but not definitive link between the image and caption. The image depicts individuals handling paper documents, which could relate to election processes. However, the image lacks explicit indicators of location or time, making it impossible to confirm it depicts activities related to Florida's voter rolls in November 2018. The external check provides strong evidence against the caption's claim.  The Snopes fact-check reveals that while a list of 53,000 deceased individuals was sent to Florida counties for voter roll removal, this was a routine process to clean up the rolls, not evidence that these individuals had voted.  The caption's implication that 53,000 dead people voted is inaccurate, according to Snopes.  Both the high confidence score (8) from the external check and the thorough debunking by Snopes significantly outweigh the relatively low confidence (8) of the internal check's plausible but unproven connection. The discrepancy arises because the internal check relies on visual similarity and circumstantial evidence, whereas the external check uses factual data from a reliable source to establish the inaccuracy of the caption's claim. The high confidence from both checks, coupled with the strong evidence of inaccuracy provided by the external check and the lack of definitive proof from the internal check, leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The core of the caption's error is in conflating the routine removal of deceased voters from the rolls with the false claim that these individuals cast votes.  The image shows activities that could be associated with election processes but offers no evidence to validate the specific claim made in the caption about the number of deceased voters and their participation in the 2018 Florida election.   The fact that the caption's central claim is demonstrably false according to Snopes is the dominant factor. The image's ambiguous nature does not provide sufficient evidence to overcome the strong external evidence refuting the caption's assertion. Therefore, the caption is out of context, with a high level of confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds a plausible but unproven connection between the image and caption.  External check strongly refutes the caption's claim using a Snopes fact-check, highlighting the inaccuracy of the assertion that 53,000 dead people voted in the 2018 Florida election. The external evidence significantly outweighs the inconclusive internal assessment, resulting in a high confidence determination that the caption is out of context."

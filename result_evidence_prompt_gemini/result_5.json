    "confidence_score": 3,
    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy because the image aligns well with the description of a Maasai jumping ritual. However, the external check completely contradicts this, showing zero confidence and reporting that there is no supporting evidence for such an event in the specified time frame or location.  This significant discrepancy necessitates a low overall confidence score.  The lack of corroborating external evidence outweighs the strong internal alignment. The explanation provided by the external check is clear and does not offer any alternative interpretations, hence the low confidence score. It's important to note that the absence of evidence doesn't necessarily mean evidence of absence.  However, given the strong negative result from the external check focusing on reputable news sources, we cannot endorse the caption's accuracy.  The image, on its own, is not enough to verify the claim about a specific rite of passage within the Masai Mara National Reserve.  To resolve this discrepancy, additional reliable sources would be needed to confirm the event's occurrence and context.  Without such corroboration, we must conclude that the caption is likely out of context, despite the apparent visual fit within the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption, while the external check completely refutes it.  The lack of external supporting evidence leads to a low confidence and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

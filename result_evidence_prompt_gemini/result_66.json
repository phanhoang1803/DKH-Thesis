While the image does not explicitly depict the temple or protests, the presence of police in riot gear is consistent with anticipation of protests in a location associated with those events.  The geographical entities are not directly visible in the image, making the confidence score moderate. There is no direct visual evidence of the events described in the news caption.",

The Sabarimala Ayyappan Temple's restrictions on women of menstruating age have been a source of significant protests and controversy in the past. Police presence in anticipation of protests related to this issue is consistent with past events. However, the specific details (exact dates, number of women) would require verification from reliable news sources to confirm completely. The phrasing 'women of menstruating age' is also somewhat vague and could be clarified.",
      "supporting_points": "- Sabarimala Temple's entry restrictions on women of menstruating age have been a long-standing and controversial issue in India.\n- Protests and demonstrations related to this issue have occurred frequently in the past.\n- A police presence to manage protests at sites of religious significance is common practice in India and elsewhere.\n- The statement lacks precise details that could be verified independently, like specific dates or names mentioned in news reports.",

    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check and the external check both agree that the image and the caption have a connection, but the confidence is not high. The internal check gives a confidence score of 7 because although the image shows policemen in riot gear, which is consistent with the anticipation of protests, there is no direct visual evidence of the events described in the caption. The external check gives a confidence score of 8 because the caption is plausible, and the Sabarimala Temple's restrictions on women of menstruating age have been a source of protests and controversy. However, the caption lacks precise details that could be verified independently. The discrepancies between the internal and external checks are minor, and both checks indicate that the image and caption are plausibly related but lack sufficient visual evidence to confirm a direct connection. Therefore, it is more conservative to conclude that the image is out of context for the provided caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find a plausible link between the image and caption but lack sufficient direct evidence. The discrepancies are minor, and a conservative assessment suggests the image is out of context."

The image was frequently shared with the claim that the pictured creature was a \"Madagascar Southeast African monkey:\"\nMadagascar, Southeast Africa Monkey\nThis photograph, however, does not capture an unusual primate from Madagascar. Instead, it depicts a doll from the \"Inari Foxes\" collection produced by the Santani Workshop in Russia. The group's Deviant Art page features several related images, including the one displayed above, of mythical creatures made of \"different types of doll plastic like fimo, cernit, sculpey, sonet:\"\nThis isn't the first time that a doll has fooled the internet. In December 2014, a photograph of a pair of cute (but fake) owlets also went viral on social media.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 1, clearly states that the image depicts monkeys, not Southeast African monkeys from Madagascar, thus deeming the caption inaccurate.  The external check further strengthens this conclusion with a confidence score of 10.  It cites a reliable source (Snopes) which explicitly confirms that the image is not of a primate from Madagascar but rather a doll from a Russian doll collection. This external evidence directly contradicts the original caption's assertion.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both unequivocally point to the caption's inaccuracy.  The high confidence scores from both checks (1 and 10) leave no room for doubt, leading to a final verdict that the caption is out of context. The external validation significantly bolsters the internal assessment, providing strong evidence that the image and caption are mismatched. Therefore, the high overall confidence score of 10 is justified.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The internal assessment identifies the image subjects as monkeys, not the specified species in the caption.  External validation, using Snopes, confirms the image depicts a doll, further refuting the caption's claim."

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check flags a low confidence score (8) due to the inability to confirm the location (Huisinish point on North Harris) and the absence of Gill Mackintosh in the image. However, the external check also provides a confidence score of 8, supporting the plausibility of the caption.  The external check acknowledges the possibility of sheep wandering into bus shelters, especially in rural areas like North Harris. The discrepancy lies in the verifiable elements; the internal check focuses on what is directly observable in the image (lack of location and person), while the external check assesses the overall plausibility of the event described.  Both checks agree that the core element—a sheep in a bus shelter—is consistent with the image.  The external validation leans on general knowledge and probabilities, accepting the location claim as plausible rather than definitively verifiable. The lack of definitive proof for the location and the photographer does not entirely invalidate the caption since the central claim (sheep in a bus shelter) is strongly supported by the image. Given the high level of agreement on the core claim and the plausible nature of the supplemental information (location, photographer), the overall confidence score remains at 8.  This reflects the uncertainty about the precise circumstances but accepts the overall narrative as likely. Considering the balance of evidence, the caption is judged as not being out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check focuses on verifiable elements within the image, while the external check assesses the overall plausibility of the described event. Both checks agree on the core claim (sheep in a bus shelter), but disagree on the supporting details (location and photographer). However, the supporting details are considered plausible based on general knowledge, leading to an overall confidence score of 8."

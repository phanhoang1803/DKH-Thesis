        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes explicitly debunks the claim that the Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum.  Snopes cites Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, directly stating that the doll \"never left the museum.\"  The article further explains that the escape rumor was based on a mistranslation and was not supported by any evidence such as police reports or eyewitness accounts. Therefore the news caption is false.",
      "supporting_points": "Snopes article directly refutes the claim, stating the rumor is false and citing Tony Spera's statement that the doll never left the museum. The article also points out the rumor's origin in a mistranslation and lack of supporting evidence.",

    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the caption's alignment with the image, focusing on the presence of Annabelle and her association with the Warren's Occult Museum.  It correctly identifies the image as depicting Annabelle but notes the caption's claim of escape is not visually verifiable. The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) due to the clear visual identification of Annabelle, despite acknowledging the unverifiable nature of the escape claim. However, the external check powerfully refutes the caption's core assertion. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, provides strong evidence disproving the claim that Annabelle ever escaped the museum.  They cite direct quotes from Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, confirming the doll's continued presence in the museum. The external check also highlights the rumor's origin in a mistranslation and the absence of any supporting evidence, such as police reports or eyewitness accounts.  Given the high confidence (10) score assigned by the external check to its refutation, and the considerable weight of the Snopes evidence, we must conclude that the caption's assertion is incorrect. The conflict between internal and external checks stems from the image's focus on Annabelle's visual appearance, while the caption's central claim (the escape) is factually false according to external validation. The external check's evidence carries significantly more weight than the limited internal validation which only confirms Annabelle's presence.  The image itself is insufficient to verify or refute the escape claim, making the external check the decisive factor.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check identifies Annabelle but notes the unverifiable escape claim, scoring 10. External check strongly refutes the escape claim with high confidence (10) using Snopes' fact-check. The discrepancy lies in the caption's false core assertion, outweighing image-based confirmation.  External validation overrides internal assessment."

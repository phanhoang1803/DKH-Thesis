        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows snow walls lining a highway in Massachusetts.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph showing high walls of snow lining the edges of a highway has been circulating on the Internet since at least 2007. Popular memes have claimed (for humorous effect) that the picture was taken in Massachusetts, or (less homorously) in Canada:\nThe image actually captures a stretch of road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture.\nThe photograph was taken by Mihai Apostu and posted to his blog, \"A Romanian in Japan,\" in April 2007:\nBefore heading down town we decided to take a walk up to Towada. On the way to Towada starting from April thh Gold Line Route is opened. This year's amount of snow was smaller than last year but the Hakkoda Walls are still big. Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall. This year there were only 6 metres of snow that guided us to Tsuta Onsen.\nAccording to a sightseeing guide for the Aomori region of Japan, the Hakkoda Walls are quite a tourist attraction. Heavy snowfalls frequently close the corridor during the winter, but when the spring season approaches the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad gets to work and clears the road:\nNational Highway 103, commonly known as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line, is a popular sightseeing route in Aomori.8 km of this Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line stretching from Sukayu to Yachi Hot Springs is closed off in winter, but thanks to the efforts of the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad, they plow through the snow from both ends to meet at Kasamatsu Pass in late March, creating a stunning snow corridor.\nIn some places the walls of snow reach a height of 9 m, allowing visitors to enjoy magnificent views of the vivid blue of the sky contrasted against the white of the snow in perfect harmony.\nThe road opens to general traffic on April 1, but before this, a Hakkoda walk is held every year to walk through this snow corridor, and many people take part in the event.",

      "explanation": "The news caption mentions \"Towering Snow Walls in Massachusetts.\"  The provided evidence from Snopes explicitly debunks this claim.  While the image of towering snow walls exists, it's from Japan, not Massachusetts. The evidence details the location as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line in Aomori prefecture, Japan, clarifying the image's origin and refuting the claim that it depicts Massachusetts.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that the photograph of high snow walls is from a road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture, not Massachusetts.  It further details the creation of these walls by snowplows along the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption, \"Are These Towering Snow Walls in Massachusetts,\" is inaccurate. The internal check identifies a mismatch between the image (showing towering snow walls) and the location (Massachusetts).  The low confidence score of 2 reflects the fact that the internal check only assesses the visual aspects of the image and its caption and doesn't access external resources to verify the location.  The external check, however, leverages external sources (likely Snopes or a similar fact-checking website), providing strong evidence that the image depicts snow walls in Japan, specifically near Towada in Aomori Prefecture along the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line. The high confidence score of 8 in the external check stems from the explicit confirmation of the image's origin from a reliable source.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both point towards the caption's inaccuracy. The external check provides definitive geographical evidence contradicting the caption's claim. The high confidence score of 9 for the final assessment reflects the combined and consistent results of both checks. The internal check provides a preliminary assessment while the external check provides strong verification through cross-referencing with established sources. Therefore, the caption is out of context, based on the combined weight of evidence from both the internal visual assessment and the external fact-checking.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes confirm that the original caption is inaccurate. The image depicts snow walls in Japan, not Massachusetts, as the caption suggests.  External sources definitively verify the location, supporting the internal assessment."

In fact, users who clicked the above-displayed message were greeted with a popup message requesting permission from a Facebook app to post on their behalf, making the article appear less like a hoax and more like an outright scam:\nMessages about Jaden Smith's alleged suicide were shared from various sites, and led to a variety of dodgy-sounding Facebook apps, including \"Smart Mobiles,\" \"Gadgy Land,\" \"Pakiza,\" \"Top Feeds\" and several others.\nIntrepid internet users who clicked the link and gave the app permission were eventually greeted with one of several \"news\" story claiming that Jaden Smith had committed suicide. The web sites responsible for this hoax have published dozens of fake news stories and graphics with this false claim:\nUsers who granted these apps permission to post to Facebook on their behalf quickly found this death hoax posted to their own Facebook feeds, thereby replicating itself across social media.\nJaden Smith himself has been active on his social media accounts, seemingly unaware that he's supposed to be dead. He posted a photograph of himself on 27 July 2016:",

    "explanation": "The caption stating that Jaden Smith committed suicide in July 2016 is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check finds the caption factually incorrect and points out that the image shows Jaden Smith alive and well with his father, Will Smith. This provides strong evidence against the claim.  The external check reinforces this conclusion by citing a Snopes article, which explicitly labels the suicide claim as false and explains its origin as a hoax propagated via social media and malicious applications.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check is fully supported by the factual accuracy and reliability of the Snopes source, a well-known fact-checking website.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both unequivocally refute the caption's assertion.  The consensus is that the caption is out of context and completely inaccurate.  The image depicts a happy, living Jaden Smith, directly contradicting the claim of suicide. The combination of visual evidence from the image and corroborating evidence from a reliable external source (Snopes) leads to a high confidence score of 10.  In summary, the caption is entirely false, grossly misrepresenting the reality presented in the image and widely debunked by external fact-checking sources.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation conclusively determine that the caption is false.  The internal analysis finds the claim factually incorrect, and the external validation uses a trusted source (Snopes) to prove the caption to be a hoax."

        "content": "LONDON (AP)  Theresa May became prime minister in 2016 with one overriding goal: to lead Britain out of the European Union.\nThree years on, the U.K. is still in the EU, and Mays time in 10 Downing St. is ending. She announced Friday that she will step down as Conservative leader on June 7, remaining as caretaker prime minister during a party leadership contest to choose her successor.\nShe will be remembered as the latest in a long line of Conservative leaders destroyed by the partys divisions over Europe, and as a prime minister who failed in her primary mission. But history may also see her as a leader who faced a devilishly difficult situation with stubborn determination.\nThe daughter of a rural Anglican vicar, May attended Oxford University and worked in financial services before being elected to Parliament in 1997.\nShe was quiet and diligent, but also ambitious. One university friend later recalled that May hoped to be Britains first female prime minister, and was quite irritated when Margaret Thatcher got there first.\nShe was not a natural political campaigner; her stiff public appearances as prime minister landed her the nickname The Maybot. Her only touches of flamboyance are a fondness for bold outfits and accessories like brightly patterned kitten-heel shoes.\nBut she soon established a reputation for solid competence and a knack for vanquishing flashier rivals.\nMay served for six years in the notoriously thankless job of home secretary, responsible for borders, immigration and law and order. In 2016, she beat flashier and better-known politicians, including Brexit-backer Boris Johnson  now the favorite to succeed her  to become Britains second female prime minister, after Margaret Thatcher.\nMay was the surprise winner of a Conservative leadership contest triggered when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down after voters rejected his advice to remain in the EU, instead voting 52%-48% to leave.\nIn her first speech as prime minister in July 2016, May sketched out plans for an ambitious policy agenda. She spoke of giving the poor a helping hand and lifting barriers to social mobility.\nBut Brexit soon crowded out almost all other policies.\nLike Cameron, May had campaigned to remain, but in office she became a champion of Brexit. Brexit means Brexit became her mantra  a meaningless one, said her detractors, as it emerged that undoing 45 years of ties with the bloc would be a fraught and complex process.\nAttempting to win the support of Conservative Brexiteers suspicious of her past pro-EU leanings, May set out firm red lines in negotiations with the EU: Britain would leave the blocs single market and customs union and end the right of EU citizens to live and work in the U.K.\nFor a time, Mays resolve helped her unite the warring factions of her party, which for decades has been divided over policy toward Europe.\nBut she then gambled on a snap election in June 2017, in an attempt to bolster her slim majority in Parliament and strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with the EU.\nThe move backfired. May ran a lackluster campaign on a platform that included plans to cut benefits to pensioners and change the way they pay for long-term care  quickly dubbed a dementia tax. The Conservatives lost their majority, and May had to strike a deal with 10 lawmakers from Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party to stay in power.\nThe DUPs support became a complication when the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland emerged as a major issue in Brexit negotiations. The unionist party strongly opposed special measures to ensure the border remained free of customs posts and other barriers, worrying they might weaken the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\nMay pressed on and in November 2018 struck a divorce agreement with the EU, setting out the terms of Britains departure and establishing a transition period of almost two years for the two sides to work out their future relations.\nAll that remained was for the British and European Parliaments to ratify it. And that is where Mays best-laid plans came undone.\nHer careful compromise of an agreement was rejected by both sides of the Brexit debate. Brexiteers felt it gave too much away and left Britain bound to EU rules. Pro-EU lawmakers wanted a softer Brexit that kept close economic ties to the bloc. In January, Mays deal was rejected by 230 votes, the biggest government defeat in British parliamentary history.\nWhatever her flaws, May was no quitter. Late last year she likened herself to Geoffrey Boycott, a cricketer who was famous for his dull but effective batting style.\nGeoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end, she said.\nShe tried again to get her Brexit deal approved, losing by 149 votes. A third attempt narrowed the margin of defeat to 48.\nShe tried talks with the Labour Party about securing a compromise, but managed only to further alienate her own lawmakers with her concessions to the opposition. A promise to let Parliament vote on whether to hold a new EU membership referendum was the final straw.\nBy this time, a growing number of Conservatives had concluded that May was the problem and would have to leave before Brexit could be sorted out.\nBut she resisted the pressure, planning instead to try for a fourth time by bringing a withdrawal agreement bill to Parliament for a vote.\nIn the end, the pressure became irresistible.\nI think the most sympathetic reading of her premiership is that she was delivered a very poor hand by her predecessor, and she dealt with it very badly, said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham.\nIt was unfortunate circumstances she found herself in, but she made them worse.",

    "explanation": "The internal check exhibits high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy based solely on the image content.  The image clearly shows Theresa May at 10 Downing Street. However, the external check reveals a low confidence score (3) because it could not verify the specific date of the media address (January 16, 2019).  The external check acknowledges a lack of information to either support or refute the date mentioned in the caption. This discrepancy highlights a crucial limitation: while the image strongly suggests a media address by Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street, the precise date cannot be confirmed using available external resources.  The significant difference in confidence scores between the internal and external checks necessitates a conservative approach.  Although the image internally validates the core elements (Theresa May, 10 Downing Street, media address), the unverified date casts doubt on the caption's complete accuracy. The lack of external evidence to support the specific date weakens the overall confidence, leading to a 'True' designation for Out Of Context (OOC) and a low confidence score.  Therefore, while the image strongly suggests a media address by Theresa May, the absence of external verification for the date makes the caption potentially out of context. Further research into news archives and official records from January 16, 2019, is required to definitively assess the caption's accuracy.  Without this further evidence, it is safer to flag the caption as potentially inaccurate due to the unverified date.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption based on image content, showing Theresa May at 10 Downing Street. However, external validation fails to confirm the specific date of the event (January 16, 2019), resulting in a low confidence score and an OOC designation."

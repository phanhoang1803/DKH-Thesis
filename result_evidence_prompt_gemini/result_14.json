        "content": "Among the 5,000 French words absorbed into Ottoman Turkish before 1914, one of the most recognisable is pasaj. Half a century after their emergence in Paris, these covered arcades flourished in Istanbul, drawing on French, Italian, and Ottoman architectural styles. Straddling the boundary between seedy and stunning, the citys arcades offer a meze of experience to the modern-day flneur, in contrast to souks where whole sections are devoted to one product, say leather, gold or precious stones. However, the recent take over of Anadolu Pasaj by a chain store highlights the vulnerability of these treasure troves to urban change. Go soon to see them while they still stand.\niek Pasaj\nGreek banker Hristaki Zografos Efendi built this most famous of Beyolu arcades on the site of the Naum Theatre, which was destroyed by fire in 1870. The original name, Cit de Pera, is still visible between the ornate caryatids and clock face above the entrance. The word iek, Turkish for flower, derives from the bouquets once sold there by White Russian exiles. Since its renovation in 1988, the grand interior has been lined with meyhanes (traditional bar/restaurants offering the quintessential trio of meze, fish, and rak. Ceneviz Meyhanesi is recommended for a night of aniseed-flavoured abandon.\nstiklal Caddesi No 80\nHazzopulo Pasaj\nIn contrast to a typical Parisian passage, this arcade is covered with hanging vines and tree branches rather than glass. Its cobbled floor runs from stiklal Caddesi to Merutiyet Caddesi, in the Beyolu district, and its central courtyard holds a hubbub of tea, waterpipes and backgammon. The arcades name comes from the Greek Hacopulo banking family, who opened the arcade in 1871, and it was later frequented by Ottoman writer Ahmet Mithat Efendi and the Young Turks. When youve finished browsing the bargain jewellery, secondhand books and Istanbul-themed T-shirts, sit down for an authentic and reasonably priced taste of diyarbakr (liver kebab) at Yirmibir Kebap.\nstiklal Caddesi No 116\nAslhan Pasaj\nIf your senses tingle at the scent of vintage pages, then this arcade will be a labyrinth of delight. Also known as Sahaflar arss (secondhand bookshops bazaar), Aslhan Pasaj offers two floors of used books, magazines, comics, and posters. Dozens of shops on each floor contain an inexhaustible library, covering everything from Anatolian mythology to pulp fiction and contemporary art. Gezegen Sahaf, on the top floor, is the largest of these shops, with an emphasis on art history and antique books.\nMerutiyet Caddesi No 10\nAtlas Pasaj\nJust like modern malls, many of these arcades were designed to offer entertainment as well as shopping. Atlas Pasaj has been a home to Atlas Cinema and the Kk Sahne state theatre since 1948  find these next to Sefahathane cafe and bar, whose arcade tables are a cosier alternative to true outdoor drinking. Just like iek Pasaj, this arcades original building was destroyed in the fire of 1870, after which the ground floor became a stable for horse dealers. Past the bar and cinema you will find a jumble of shops for womens fashion, antiques, and novelty souvenirs.\nstiklal Caddesi No 131\nFransz Geidi\nStanding by the Karaky shore, Fransz Geidi reflects the strong presence of European traders at this port throughout the Ottoman era. Built in 1860, the cross-shaped arcade had fallen into disrepair before being restored to its neoclassical glory in 1992. The lower floors are filled with upscale cafes and restaurants, including Ops Passage, owned by former sea captain Yasin Kalender. The Turkish breakfast, fresh seafood and kadayf dessert (similar to baklava) are not to be passed by. Meanwhile, Kathanes reproductions of vintage Turkish school notebooks make excellent gifts.\nMumhane Caddesi, opposite the Turkish Orthodox Church; second entrance on Kemanke Caddesi\nAvrupa Pasaj\nAround the corner from stiklal Caddesi, one of Istanbuls famous avenues, the entrance to this glass-covered arcade is easily missed. But its worth finding Avrupa Pasaj for its architecture alone, and also the engrossing displays of antiques, textiles, ceramics, and lamps. The arcade was previously called Aynal Pasaj (mirrored arcade) after the ground floors 22 mirrors  which also fell victim to the great fire of 1870. A row of classical figures still adorns the arcades sculpted walls, which stretch upwards to an arched glass ceiling. If you feel your life would be more complete with a meerschaum pipe or an Ottoman dagger, then Avrupa Pasaj is the place for you.\nMerutiyet Caddesi No 8\nSuriye pasaj\nThis neoclassical pasaj was commissioned by a relative of the Syrian Hasan Halbuni Paa, the first Muslim to head the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. Impressive wrought iron doors flank the entrance, leading to an ornate arcade crossed by four bridges. A traditional teashop spreads its tables here while the Coop live music bar attracts an alternative crowd at the arcades far end. Vintage-lovers should dive into By Retro, an underground maze of eccentric fashion that has provided costumes for Turkish films and television shows\nstiklal Caddesi No 166\nTokatlyan Pasaj\nUnder the ownership of the Armenian Mgrdi Tokatlyan, the Hotel M Tokatlyan was a fixture in the high-class social life of Pera, the historic Istanbul quarter now known as Beyolu. Notable patrons included Leon Trotsky and Mustafa Kemal, but by the 1950s the building had changed hands and fallen into disrepair, at which point a local Armenian church bought the property. Calls to preserve the hotel as a museum were ignored, and small shops soon filled the space. A visit to Tokatlyan Pasaj is an eerie exercise in memory  catch melancholy glimpses of Peras fantastic past as you stroll by the barbers, teashops, and printing presses.\nstiklal Caddesi No 76\nAkmar Pasaj\nFound in the Asian neighbourhood of Kadky, Akmar Pasaj entered popular parlance as the satanist arcade after 21-year-old ehriban Cokunfrat was ritually killed by three friends in 1999 and a police raid on the arcade discovered Satanist literature, axes and crosses, and 15 people were remanded in custody. Shops selling heavy metal LPs, CDs, tapes and T-shirts still line the arcade today, though you will also find more innocent purveyors of precious stones, crystals and secondhand books  the most reputable of these is Nadir Kitabevi.\nMhrdar Caddesi No 70\nAznavur Pasaj\nThis arcade began life in 1900 as a block of luxury apartments with a private courtyard, before being opened at both ends to allow pedestrians in. Eminent Armenian architect Hovsep Aznavur put his name to the building, also designing the striking Msr Apartman on stiklal Caddesi and several of Istanbuls theatres, hans and churches. Today, Aznavur Pasaj is a prime spot to spend an hour or two surrounded by colourful tights, outlandish underwear, vampy boots and headgear of all kinds. The arcades variety of inexpensive jewellery and evil-eye baubles is also a sight to behold.\nstiklal Caddesi No 108",

The image clearly shows people shopping in a bustling Istanbul market. The architecture and atmosphere strongly suggest an Istanbul setting.

While the external source does not explicitly state \"Shoppers in an Istanbul market,\" it describes shopping arcades in Istanbul, implying the presence of shoppers. The details about shops and merchandise strongly suggest a shopping environment.  However, the lack of explicit mention of \"shoppers in a market\" lowers the confidence score.\n\nThere is a slight discrepancy between the confidence scores of the internal and external checks. The internal check has higher confidence, while the external check acknowledges some uncertainty due to the indirect nature of the evidence. However, this discrepancy is not significant enough to challenge the overall accuracy of the caption. Both checks support the caption's assertion, indicating that the caption is not out of context.\n\nThe overall confidence score of 8 reflects a balance between the high confidence of the internal check and the slightly lower confidence of the external check. The combined evidence strongly suggests that the caption \"Shoppers in an Istanbul market\" accurately represents the image content.  The image shows people shopping, the setting is consistent with a market in Istanbul, and external information indirectly supports the presence of shoppers in an Istanbul marketplace.  Therefore, the caption is not out of context.",

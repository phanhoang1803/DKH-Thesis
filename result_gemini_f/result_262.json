Instead most were walking with a purpose, perhaps to go to work or to pick up lunch.\nThe bigger shops had several people inside but if you looked through the windows of the more specialists shops, the sales assistants were standing alone, with no-one to serve.\nPeople eating in a sit-down restaurant were pretty much eating alone, however places where food could be taken away had a steady trade.\nThere were still a few tourists, strolling down either looking for their hotel or pointing out the sights, but how long they will stay here remains to be seen.\nLondon is not on lockdown - but people are definitely attempting to keep a social distance.\nAll pictures subject to copyright",

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions deserted streets in London due to government measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak. While the article doesn't specifically mention Leicester Square, it describes a similar situation in other parts of London, with Oxford Street being less busy than usual.  The lack of specific mention of Leicester Square on March 17th makes it hard to definitively verify the caption, but the general context suggests it's plausible. The article supports the idea that parts of London were quieter than normal due to the pandemic.",

    "explanation": "The internal check has high confidence (score 10) that the image depicts a deserted Leicester Square in London.  This is based on a visual assessment of the image showing the square with few people and the visible landmarks aligning with Leicester Square. However, the internal check cannot verify the date (March 17th) mentioned in the caption. The external check provides supporting evidence (score 4) indicating that streets in London were quieter than normal in March due to government measures related to the coronavirus outbreak. While the external source doesn't specifically mention Leicester Square on that particular date, the general context corroborates the possibility of the square being less crowded. The discrepancy lies in the lack of precise date verification from both sources.  The image alone cannot confirm the date, and the external source offers contextual support rather than direct confirmation for the specific date and location.  Therefore, while both checks suggest the caption is likely accurate, the absence of definitive date verification lowers the overall confidence score.  The internal analysis strongly supports the identification of Leicester Square and its deserted state, while the external source provides plausible context for the overall situation described in London during that period. Combining these assessments, we conclude that the caption is not out of context but the confidence is moderated due to the uncertainty about the date.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the image content, identifying it as Leicester Square and noting its deserted appearance. External check provides contextual evidence supporting the quieter atmosphere in London during that period, but it does not specifically confirm the date or location mentioned.  The combined analysis suggests the caption is likely accurate but lacks definitive date verification, resulting in a moderate confidence score."

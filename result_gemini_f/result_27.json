The image was frequently shared with the claim that the pictured creature was a \"Madagascar Southeast African monkey:\"\nMadagascar, Southeast Africa Monkey\nThis photograph, however, does not capture an unusual primate from Madagascar. Instead, it depicts a doll from the \"Inari Foxes\" collection produced by the Santani Workshop in Russia. The group's Deviant Art page features several related images, including the one displayed above, of mythical creatures made of \"different types of doll plastic like fimo, cernit, sculpey, sonet:\"\nThis isn't the first time that a doll has fooled the internet. In December 2014, a photograph of a pair of cute (but fake) owlets also went viral on social media.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate. The internal check, with a confidence score of 1, correctly identifies that the image depicts langurs, a type of monkey native to Asia, not Southeast Africa or Madagascar.  This assessment is based on a clear understanding of langur's geographical distribution and the visual identification of the species in the photograph. The internal check's verdict of 'False' aligns perfectly with the facts.\n\nThe external check further strengthens this conclusion with a confidence score of 10.  It cites a Snopes.com fact-check article that directly refutes the original caption.  This article definitively states that the image is not of a rare primate from Madagascar but instead depicts a doll from a Russian collection.  The Snopes article offers direct evidence and strong contextual information, making its verdict of 'False' highly reliable. The high confidence score (10) reflects the article's strong evidence and direct contradiction of the caption's claim.\n\nThere is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both independently and consistently arrive at the same conclusion: the caption is false and the image does not depict a Southeast African monkey from Madagascar. The high confidence scores from both checks (1 and 10) reinforce this conclusion. The external check, with its reference to a credible source (Snopes.com), provides even stronger evidence. Considering all the evidence, it is unequivocally clear that the caption is out of context.\n\nThe combination of strong internal analysis, based on zoological knowledge, and the robust external verification from a reliable fact-checking source establishes an exceptionally high degree of certainty about the caption's inaccuracy. The evidence is compelling and leaves no room for alternative interpretations.  Therefore, the final verdict is that the original caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks definitively confirm that the caption is inaccurate. The image shows langurs (Asian monkeys), not Southeast African monkeys from Madagascar.  A Snopes.com fact-check further reveals the image depicts a doll, not a monkey."

He was never a CCM insider and confounded many when he was elected as the ruling party's presidential candidate.\nAs works minister in the outgoing government, Mr Magufuli was reputed to be a no-nonsense, results-driven politician. He became known as \"The Bulldozer\" for driving a programme to build roads across the country.\nHe campaigned for the presidency on a platform of hard work, and will now have to tackle far bigger problems facing the East African state. This includes constant power outages, and corruption - an issue which led to many people turning against CCM in the election.\n'The Bulldozer' in profile\nPresident Jakaya Kikwete, who is standing down after two terms in office, retweeted a CCM photo of Mr Magufuli, external and the accompanying words: \"Our next Commander-in-Chief, Dr John Pombe Magufuli, the President-elect of The United Republic of Tanzania.\"\nAbdallah Safari, vice-president of Chadema, one of the four opposition parties that make up Ukama, told the BBC that Tanzanians \"have been robbed of their victory\".\nBBC Tanzania analyst Zuhura Yunus says the result is a big blow for Mr Lowassa after four opposition parties put their faith in him, uniting for the first time to field a single candidate.",

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions celebrations by supporters of Tanzania's ruling party following their candidate's victory in the Zanzibari presidential election. While the main article focuses on the national presidential election results, it does mention the CCM party's victory and the subsequent reactions.  The article does not specifically detail celebrations in Zanzibar, but the general celebratory atmosphere following Magufuli's victory can be inferred. The lack of explicit mention of Zanzibari celebrations lowers the confidence score.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1:  Reports on the victory of John Magufuli of the CCM party in the Tanzanian presidential election.  While not directly addressing Zanzibari celebrations, it implies a climate of celebration among the ruling party's supporters following the election results.",

    "explanation": "The internal check expresses doubt about the caption's accuracy due to the lack of definitive visual confirmation of the party affiliation, specific event, and location depicted in the image.  The confidence score is low (6) because the visual evidence alone is insufficient to confirm the caption's claims. The external check, while offering some supporting evidence (reports of the CCM party's victory and general celebrations), lacks specific details about celebrations in Zanzibar as described in the caption. The external check's confidence score is also moderate (7), acknowledging the absence of direct confirmation of the Zanzibari celebrations from the sources consulted.  Considering both checks, the overall confidence is low (around 4). The discrepancy lies in the level of detail: the caption specifies a celebratory event in Zanzibar following a specific election result; while external sources confirm the broader context of the election win and general celebrations by the ruling party, they do not explicitly corroborate the specific details mentioned in the caption, particularly regarding the location and specific nature of the celebrations shown in the image. The image itself is ambiguous; while the person might be celebrating a political victory, there is no definitive evidence to link them to the CCM party or the described Zanzibari election event. Therefore, a conservative judgment is made, concluding that the caption is likely out of context based on the available evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds insufficient visual evidence to confirm caption details. External check finds some supporting evidence for the general context but lacks specific details about the Zanzibari celebrations mentioned in the caption. Both checks point towards low confidence in the caption's accuracy."

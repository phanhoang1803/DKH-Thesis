        "title": "US officials: Pilot error caused Kobe Bryant chopper crash",
        "date": "2021-02-09T23:20:51",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP)  The pilot who crashed the helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant, killing all nine aboard, made a series of poor decisions that led him to fly blindly into a wall of clouds where he became so disoriented he thought he was climbing when the craft was plunging toward a Southern California hillside, federal safety officials said Tuesday.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board primarily blamed pilot Ara Zobayan in the Jan. 26, 2020 crash that killed him along with Bryant, the basketball stars daughter and six other passengers heading to a girls basketball tournament.\nZobayan, an experienced pilot, ignored his training, violated flight rules by flying into conditions where he couldnt see and failed to take alternate measures, such as slowing down and landing or switching to auto-pilot, that would have averted the tragedy.\nThe NTSB said it was likely Zobayan felt pressure to deliver his star client to his daughters game at Bryants Mamba Sports Academy. Officials believe Zobayan may have also felt continuation bias, an unconscious tendency among pilots to stick with the original plan despite changing conditions.\nThe closer you get to the destination the more you think just maybe you can pull this off, NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said Tuesday.\nThe agency announced the long-awaited findings during a four-hour hearing pinpointing probable causes of what went awry in the 40-minute flight. The crash led to widespread public mourning for the retired basketball star and several lawsuits, and prompted state and federal legislation.\nThe agency also faulted Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, for inadequate review and oversight of safety matters.\nWhen Zobayan decided to climb above the clouds, he entered a trap that has doomed many flights. Once a pilot loses visual cues by flying into fog or darkness, the inner ear can send erroneous signals to the brain that causes spatial disorientation. Its sometimes known as the leans, causing pilots to believe they are flying aircraft straight and level when they are banking.\nZobayan radioed air traffic controllers that he was climbing when, in fact, he was banking and descending rapidly toward the steep hills near Calabasas, NTSB investigators concluded.\nFlying under visual flight rules, Zobayan was required to be able to see where he was going. Flying into the cloud was a violation of that standard and probably led to his disorientation, NTSB said.\nThere were 184 aircraft crashes between 2010-2019 involving spatial disorientation, including 20 fatal helicopter crashes, the NTSB said.\nWhat part of cloud, when youre on a visual flight rules program, do pilots not understand? Landsberg said.\nNTSB member Michael Graham said Zobayan ignored his training and added that that as long as helicopter pilots continue flying into clouds without relying on instruments, which requires a high level of training, a certain percentage arent going to come out alive.\nZobayan had been certified to fly using only instruments, but was no longer proficient, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.\nThe Sikorsky S-76B helicopter was flying at about 184 mph (296 kph) and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) per minute when it slammed into the hillside and ignited, scattering debris over an area the size of a football field. The victims died immediately.\nBryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and six others who left Orange County that morning were headed to his Mamba Sports Academy in Ventura County. The group had flown to the same destination the previous day and Zobayan had flown Bryant along that route at least 10 times in 2019.\nThe aircraft itself had been flown on largely direct routes between the airports in Orange and Ventura counties about two dozen times since late 2018, data shows, but the pilot took the chopper further north because of low visibility that day.\nThere was no sign of mechanical failure and the pilot was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, investigators said.\nThe helicopter did not have so-called black box recording devices, which were not required, that would have given investigators a better understanding of what happened.\nThe NTSB report reiterated a previous recommendation to require flight data and cockpit voice recorders on choppers, but the agency only investigates transportation-related crashes. It has no enforcement powers and must submit suggestions to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration or the Coast Guard, which have repeatedly rejected some board safety recommendations after other transportation disasters.\nOver the past year, experts speculated that the crash could lead to a recommendation for requiring helicopters to have Terrain Awareness and Warning System devices, which signal when aircraft are in danger of crashing.\nBut NTSB investigator-in-charge Bill English said the system, which was not on the helicopter, would probably not have prevented the crash.\nThe hilly terrain, combined with the disorientation, would have made the warning system a confusing factor, English said.\nThe pilot doesnt know which way is up, English said.\nFederal lawmakers have sponsored the Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant Helicopter Safety Act to mandate the warning systems on all helicopters carrying six or more passengers.\nThe NTSB report is likely to factor into litigation in the case, whether its admissible in court or not, said Dallas lawyer Michael Lyons.\nThe crash generated lawsuits and countersuits, with Bryants widow suing Island Express and the pilot for wrongful death on the day a massive public memorial was held almost a year ago at Staples Center, where the Lakers all-star played most his career.\nVanessa Bryant said Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, and its owner, Island Express Holding Corp., did not properly train or supervise Zobayan. She said the pilot was careless and negligent to fly in fog and should have aborted the flight.\nZobayans brother, Berge Zobayan, has said Kobe Bryant knew the risks of flying in a helicopter and that his survivors arent entitled to damages from the pilots estate. Island Express Helicopters Inc. denied responsibility and said the crash was an act of God that it could not control.\nLawyers for Berge Zobayan and Island Express said they had no comment on the NTSB findings.\nFamilies of other victims sued the helicopter companies but not the pilot.\nThe others killed in the crash were Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughters basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton. Alyssa and Payton were Giannas teammates.\nThe companies have countersued two FAA air traffic controllers, saying the crash was caused by their series of erroneous acts and/or omissions.\nWhile air traffic controllers failed to report the loss of radar contact and radar communication with the flight, which was inconsistent with their procedures, it did not contribute to the crash, the NTSB said.",

    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses low confidence (confidence_score = 3) in the caption's accuracy because the image depicts a fire and smoke, lacking explicit evidence to confirm it as footage from the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash.  The visual lacks identifying details such as the crash site or any recognizable elements that would directly link it to the event. The internal check's verdict is therefore False. However, the external check (confidence_score = 8) provides strong evidence supporting the occurrence of the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash.  Multiple reputable news sources (BBC) confirm the event, corroborating the caption's claim regarding the crash. The discrepancy stems from the caption's claim of \"live footage.\" The external evidence confirms the crash but does not independently verify the image as live footage from that specific event. The external check's high confidence stems from the widely reported nature of the event and the credibility of the news sources confirming it.  Therefore, while the image itself is insufficient to verify the caption's claim, the external evidence strongly supports the occurrence of the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash. To resolve the conflict, we need to consider that the caption might be misleading or inaccurate by claiming \"live footage\" when the provided image simply shows a fire and smoke.  The claim of \"live footage\" requires visual evidence directly linking the fire and smoke to the helicopter crash.  The image alone doesn't suffice to validate this claim.  The external validation strongly supports the factual basis of the crash; however, it does not support the additional claim of 'live footage'.  A lower confidence score (7) reflects this uncertainty in definitively verifying the image's context as \"live footage\" despite strong evidence confirming the helicopter crash itself.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context based on the image's lack of direct evidence, despite the external confirmation of the crash.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags low confidence due to the image's lack of direct evidence linking it to the Kobe Bryant crash. External check shows high confidence confirming the crash but does not validate the \"live footage\" claim.  The final assessment is that the caption is out of context regarding the 'live footage' claim despite confirmation of the crash itself."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

      "explanation": "The provided fact-checking article from Snopes.com directly addresses the claim in the news caption.  It states that while the video is real, it is miscaptioned. The video shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 tearing down a surveillance tower, not a 5G tower in China to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The article thoroughly debunks the connection between the video and the claims made in the news caption. Therefore, the caption is demonstrably false.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check identified inconsistencies within the video itself, noting a lack of evidence to support the claims about location (China), the type of tower (5G), and the motive (stopping COVID-19 spread).  The low confidence score of 3 reflects this uncertainty.  However, the external check provides definitive proof that the caption is false. The Snopes fact-check demonstrates that the video depicts protests in Hong Kong in 2019, predating the COVID-19 pandemic and involving the destruction of a surveillance tower, not a 5G tower in China.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check, supported by a reputable fact-checking source, outweighs the lower confidence score from the internal check.  The external evidence irrefutably refutes the original caption's claims. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both point towards the caption being inaccurate and misleading.  The combination of the internal analysis highlighting ambiguities and the external validation definitively debunking the claims leads to a high confidence score of 10 for the final assessment.  In conclusion, the available evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the caption is completely out of context and factually incorrect.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly confirm that the original caption is inaccurate and misleading. The video depicts a different event than what is described in the caption.  The external fact-check provides irrefutable evidence contradicting the caption's claims."

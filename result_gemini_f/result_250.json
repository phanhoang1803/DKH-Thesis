      "explanation": "Don Moen is a known praise and worship leader, making the core claim plausible.  However, without specific sources confirming a Kigali performance, the claim remains unverifiable.  Pastors frequently tour internationally, so a first-time performance in Kigali is not inherently implausible, but requires further verification from official announcements or news reports.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption to be consistent with the image, as it shows Don Moen performing. However, the confidence score is low because the image itself does not offer any information about a Kigali performance. The external check casts doubt on the caption's claim about a Kigali performance, as there is no readily available public information to support this. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of Don Moen performing internationally given his career, but the absence of concrete evidence lowers the confidence.  Therefore, considering the lack of supporting evidence from external sources to confirm the Kigali performance, the caption is deemed out of context, despite the image aligning with the caption's description of Don Moen. The discrepancy lies in the verification of the location and specific event. While the image confirms the presence of Don Moen, consistent with the caption, external validation fails to confirm the event's location, resulting in a final assessment of 'out of context'. The final confidence score is lowered to reflect the uncertainty surrounding the Kigali performance claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image shows Don Moen, but external check finds no evidence of a scheduled Kigali performance. Discrepancy in location verification leads to an 'out of context' assessment."

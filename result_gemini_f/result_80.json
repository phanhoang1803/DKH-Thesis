        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton got her wish that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought.\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, its an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

      "explanation": "The claim that Hillary Clinton \"got her wish\" that someone like Donald Trump would run for office is addressed by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website.  Snopes rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned\",  explaining that it uses a fabricated quote attributed to Clinton and a doctored image. The quote is false, and the meme's context is misleading. This directly contradicts the news caption's assertion.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the presence of Clinton and Trump in the image. However, the external check, also with high confidence (10), contradicts this by citing Snopes's analysis.  Snopes definitively labels the claim as \"Miscaptioned\", stating that the quote attributed to Clinton is fabricated and the image is doctored. The high confidence scores from both checks, along with the strong evidence from Snopes (a reputable fact-checking source), create a significant conflict.  The external check's evidence is decisive: a fabricated quote and doctored image invalidate the caption's assertion.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context. The detailed explanation provided by Snopes leaves no room for doubt that the caption is misrepresenting the relationship and interaction depicted in the image.  Given the strong, contradictory evidence, and the high confidence levels of both checks, there's no uncertainty in concluding that the caption is out of context. The image's context is demonstrably different from the claim made in the caption. This discrepancy between the internal and external verification aligns with the entity analysis: while the image shows Trump and Clinton together, the caption's interpretation is unfounded and based on a false quote.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on image content.  External check, also highly confident, contradicts this using Snopes' fact-check, revealing a fabricated quote and doctored image. The external evidence is conclusive, indicating that the caption is out of context."

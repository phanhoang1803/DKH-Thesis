    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image clearly depicts Maasai men in traditional clothing performing a jump, which aligns with the description of a traditional jumping ritual. However, the external check has a confidence score of 0, indicating a failure to find supporting evidence from external sources.  The lack of corroborating evidence from news articles or reliable online sources significantly undermines the caption's credibility.  The discrepancy between the high internal confidence and the complete lack of external validation suggests a high level of uncertainty. While the image itself strongly suggests a Maasai jumping ritual, the absence of any external verification renders the caption's claim about the specific context (rite of passage, junior elder transition, Masai-Mara National Reserve) unverifiable. Therefore, due to the significant lack of external support, the caption is considered out of context, with low confidence in its overall accuracy.  A more cautious approach would be to describe the image as depicting Maasai men in a jumping ritual, omitting the specific details about the rite of passage and location that lack external corroboration.  Further investigation is needed to confirm or refute these details.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the alignment of the image with the caption's description of a Maasai jumping ritual.  External check finds no supporting evidence, leading to a low confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context due to the lack of external verification for the specific details."

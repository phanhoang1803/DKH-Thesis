        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin hasnt been vaccinated against the coronavirus yet, months after he announced his countrys Sputnik V as the worlds first approved Covid-19 vaccine and said his own daughter had taken it.\nThe Kremlin said Tuesday that Putin cannot get a vaccine that has not yet finished the final stage of trials, even though the jab has already been given to some Russian frontline health care workers, teachers and several top level officials outside the clinical trials.\nThe President cannot use an uncertified vaccine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a call with reporters. Peskov did not explain the difference between the vaccine being certified and approved, but said: Mass vaccination has not started yet. And, of course, the head of state cannot take part in vaccination as a volunteer. Its impossible.\nPeskov said the trials should be completed soon and that Putin would inform people on his decision on whether to take the vaccine if he considers it necessary.\nThe news that Putin hasnt taken the vaccine yet came on the same day that Sputnik Vs developers published new information about the vaccine, touting it as effective, cheap and easy to transport.\nThe Gamaelya institute, which is developing the vaccine, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which finances it, reported more interim data on the vaccine on Tuesday. In a news releases, they said that analysis of data obtained 28 days after the first dose and seven days after the second dose suggests the Sputnik vaccine was 91.4% effective in preventing infections.\nThe release said the researchers identified 39 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the volunteers  31 in the placebo group and eight among those who received the vaccine. It added 18,794 volunteers took part in the study.\nPfizer and Moderna reported similar efficacy rates  94.5% for Moderna and 95% for Pfizer. However, their claims were based on larger sized clinical trials. Moderna reported 95 Covid-19 cases amongst its volunteers  90 in the placebo group and 5 in the vaccinated cohort, while Pfizer reported 170 cases  162 in the placebo group and eight in the participants who received the vaccine.\nAstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70%. It said a total of 131 study participants developed Covid-19 but did not say how many of those people had received the Covid-19 vaccine and how many did not.\nIn a separate statement, the Gamaelya institute and the RDIF said one dose of the vaccine will cost less than $10 on international markets, which they said was two or more times cheaper than mRNA vaccines with similar efficacy levels. The two-dose vaccine and vaccination will be free of charge for Russian citizens, the statement added. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines.\nIn the statement on Tuesday, Russia also said the Sputnik vaccine can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, which is similar to what AstraZeneca said about its vaccine on Monday.\nMeanwhile, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at around -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) while its transported. Moderna said its vaccine can be kept in freezers typically available in pharmacies, and in a refrigerator for 30 days.\nPutin first announced Russias vaccine was approved for public use in August, even though at that point it had been tested only on several dozen subjects in a non-blind study. The announcement came before the start of Phase 3 trials, which are key to establishing its safety and efficacy, and drew skepticism from the international community.\nI know that it works quite effectively, it forms a stable immunity, Putin said at the time, adding that one of his daughters had already taken the jab  a rare move from the President, who is notoriously secretive about his family. He said she had a slightly higher temperature after each dose, but added now she feels well.\nPutin, at 68 years old, is in a high risk group. Vaccine trials for the first group of volunteers aged 60 and over began on October 28, according to Russian state new agency TASS.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that Putin's daughter died after receiving her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  The provided text from CNN only states that Putin's daughter received the vaccine and experienced a slightly higher temperature afterward, but it does not mention her death. Therefore, the caption is not supported by the article and is likely false. The article lacks information to support the claim of death.  The source is from CNN, which is a reputable news organization, but this specific claim is not present.",

    "explanation": "The claim in the caption is factually incorrect and completely unrelated to the image.  The internal check identifies a significant mismatch between the image content (a young woman getting her blood pressure checked) and the caption's claim about Putin's daughter's death after a COVID-19 vaccination. The internal check gives a confidence score of 0, indicating a complete lack of alignment. The external check further strengthens this conclusion by referencing a CNN article. While the article mentions Putin's daughter receiving the Sputnik V vaccine and experiencing mild side effects, it explicitly does not mention her death.  The external check assigns a confidence score of 3, which, while not as strong as the internal check, still supports the conclusion of the caption being false. Both checks are strongly aligned in their assessment. The external check's lower confidence score is due to the fact that its assessment is based on verification against an external source, which is less direct than the immediate visual analysis performed by the internal check. However, it provides crucial corroborating evidence by indicating that the death claim is unfounded based on verifiable reporting from a reputable news organization. There are no discrepancies between the two checks; both unequivocally indicate the caption is out of context. The high level of agreement, along with the strong evidence from both sources, yields a confidence score of 10.  In essence, the claim in the caption is demonstrably false, as verified by both a visual analysis of the image and an external fact-check against a reputable news source.  There is no basis for associating the image with the death claim in the caption, and the image content does not in any way support or relate to the caption's narrative.  Therefore, the caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly agree that the caption is out of context. The image shows a routine medical procedure, while the caption makes a false claim about the death of Putin's daughter related to a COVID-19 vaccine.  External verification confirms that the death claim is unsubstantiated."

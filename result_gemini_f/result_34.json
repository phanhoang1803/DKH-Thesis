Clicking through on the social media post led users to a rogue website which displayed a fake CNN video announcing the supposed \"shocking\" death of the Smiths (along with some other adult content):\nThe purpose of this hoax appeared to be to bait users into clicking to view the video as a means of driving them to malicious web pages, and to trick them into sharing the hoax post on social media in order to spread it further. Users are strongly advised not to visit to the website that underlies this hoax post and not to click on anything displayed there.",

The article explicitly states that the claim of Will and Jaden Smith dying in a car crash is false and originated as a hoax designed to spread misinformation through social media.

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 10, points out the clear mismatch between the image (showing Will and Jaden Smith alive) and the caption's claim of their death in a car accident.  The external check, also with a confidence score of 10, reinforces this by citing a fact-checking article from Snopes.com that explicitly debunks the claim as a hoax.  There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks; both unequivocally confirm the caption's falsity. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) leave no room for doubt.  The caption is demonstrably false and entirely unrelated to the provided image.  The image shows a father and son at an event. There is no indication of a car accident, injury, or death. The caption introduces completely fabricated information about their supposed death, making it entirely out of context.",

        "content": "Nearly a month after supporters of President Donald Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recounted the experience from her perspective.\nIn a 90-minute Instagram Live video, Oscasio-Cortez described fearing for her life as she hid in the bathroom of her office in the Cannon House Office Building, a part of the Capitol complex.\nDays later, the second-term congresswoman pushed back against right-wing critics who said she exaggerated the danger she faced during the riot.\n\"AOC wasnt even in the Capitol building during her near death experience,\" read one headline on RedState, one of several conservative websites that questioned Ocasio-Cortezs account.\n\"AOC lied!\" another headline said. \"She Wasnt Even in the Capitol Building During the RiotHer Life Was Never in Danger: Report.\"\nSimilar claims attacking Ocasio-Cortez cropped up in widespread posts on Facebook, where they were flagged as part of the companys efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nOn Twitter, hashtags likened Ocasio-Cortez to actor Jussie Smollett, who was indicted for false reports to police and accused of staging an attack against himself.\nThe criticism also reached cable news. \"There were no rioters in (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's) hallway,\" said Fox News host Tucker Carlson. \"Trump voters weren't trying to kill her.\"\nOcasio-Cortez stood by her remarks and pushed back against the attacks online. As she went back and forth on Twitter with conservative activist and One America News Network correspondent Jack Posobiec, readers asked PolitiFact what was true and what wasnt.\nIts true that Ocasio-Cortez was not in the main Capitol building where the House and Senate chambers are located as rioters broke in. She was in the Cannon building.\nBut she never claimed in her video to have been in the main Capitol building, and the Cannon building was one of two buildings in the broader Capitol complex that was forced to evacuate.\nOcasio-Cortez feared she \"could die\" as police knocked on her door\nIn her Instagram Live video, Ocasio-Cortez said she had just gotten off the phone with her chief of staff and was scrolling through lunch options at around 1 p.m. when she heard \"huge, violent bangs on my door.\" It was like \"someone was trying to break the door down,\" she said.\nAround that time, rioters were already gathering outside the Capitol, but they had not broken in, according to timelines from USA Today, the Washington Post and the New York Times.\nOcasio-Cortez said she ran over to her legislative director, Geraldo \"G\" Bonilla-Chavez, who told her to \"hide, hide, run and hide.\"\nAs she hid in her office bathroom behind the door, Ocasio-Cortez said she heard a mans voice yelling from inside her office. \"I just hear, Where is she? Where is she?\" Ocasio-Cortez told her Instagram Live viewers. \"And this is the moment where I thought everything was over.\"\n\"I mean, I thought I was going to die,\" she said.\nOcasio-Cortez said the person calling for her was actually a Capitol Police officer who did not identify himself  a fact she did not know as she hid.\nOcasio-Cortez said the Capitol Police officer told her to go to another building. She said she could hear \"all of these rioters behind the glass of the door\" as she and Bonilla-Chavez sought a place to take shelter. She ended up hunkering down in the office of Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., who also detailed the experience on Feb. 1 during an interview with MSNBC.\n\"I fully expected that by this point, the building had been breached and there were people walking the hallways,\" she said.\nThe attacks\nSome websites attacking Ocasio-Cortez cited comments from Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. Mace tweeted Feb. 2 that the rioters never made it to the hallway she shares with Ocasio-Cortez.\nMace was addressing a story from Newsweek, which erroneously reported that Ocasio-Cortez said rioters had entered her office. In her Instagram Live video, Ocasio-Cortez said that she was scared by the banging on her door because she did not know it was an officer.\n\"None of us knew in the moment what areas were compromised,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Feb. 4, after Mace shared a Fox News headline that used her comments to discredit Ocasio-Cortez.\nThe Cannon building was one of two buildings evacuated by Capitol Police as pro-Trump rioters outside moved toward to Capitol, which they broke into just after 2 p.m. It is a part of the larger Capitol complex, which is connected by underground tunnels accessible to lawmakers.\nSeveral lawmakers, including Mace, tweeted about the evacuation in real time. \"Just evacuated my office due to a nearby threat,\" Mace wrote in her Jan. 6 tweet posted at 1:45 p.m. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., said that the evacuation was due to \"a pipe bomb reported outside.\"\nThe Capitol Police did not respond to PolitiFacts inquiry about the evacuation. An FBI agents affidavit in support of an arrest warrant for one man charged in the riot said that the evacuation was \"in part because of a suspicious package found nearby.\"\nPipe bombs were discovered Jan. 6 near the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters. Both locations are within blocks of the Cannon building.\n\"They are manipulating the fact that most people dont know the layout (of) the Capitol complex,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet. \"We were all on the Capitol complex  the attack wasnt just on the dome. The bombs Trump supporters planted surrounded our offices too.\"\nA spokesperson for the congresswoman declined to comment further.\nThe criticism of Ocasio-Cortez also minimized the threat posed to lawmakers and police by the mob at the Capitol, as Snopes reported. Videos and photos show rioters fighting with police, carrying zip-tie handcuffs and weapons, and chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n\"Assassinate AOC,\" one man facing charges tweeted hours after storming the building.",

      "explanation": "The provided text focuses on Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's experience during the Capitol riot,  specifically addressing claims about her location and the threats she perceived. While this article doesn't directly address the sharing of photographs on TikTok and Twitter, the timeframe (late 2020 and early 2021) aligns with the period surrounding the event, making it somewhat relevant. The absence of direct contradiction, combined with the article's reputable source (PolitiFact), leads to a leaning towards true. However, the lack of direct evidence regarding photographs limits the confidence score.",

    "explanation": "The internal check definitively shows a mismatch between the caption and the image content. The image depicts Dua Lipa, not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This internal inconsistency immediately casts doubt on the caption's accuracy.  The external check, while suggesting some temporal alignment with events surrounding the Capitol riot (which involved Rep. Ocasio-Cortez), lacks direct evidence supporting the claim about widely shared photographs on TikTok and Twitter.  The external source focuses on Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's experience during the riot, not on the specific dissemination of images of her. The absence of visual evidence to corroborate the claim is a significant weakness.  Therefore, the external validation has limited weight in this case. The discrepancy is primarily driven by the image itself which provides irrefutable evidence that the caption is describing a different person entirely. While the temporal proximity of the caption's timeframe to events relevant to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez adds a minor layer of complexity, the clear and direct visual contradiction renders the caption out of context. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the internal check, with its focus on image content, has a more direct and unambiguous connection to the caption's veracity.  The low confidence score in the external validation also significantly reduces its impact. The fact that the image analysis and human observation both confirm that the subject in the image is not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez outweighs any potential circumstantial connection alluded to by the external validation. In conclusion, the high confidence score in the internal check (0), reflecting the total mismatch between image and caption, heavily influences the final determination. The external check's weak support does not sufficiently offset this definitive internal contradiction, and the lack of direct supporting evidence in the external source undermines its credibility in this specific context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows a definitive mismatch (image shows Dua Lipa, not AOC). External check offers weak temporal alignment but lacks direct evidence on image sharing. Strong internal mismatch outweighs weak external support."

        "content": "Claim:\nSetting your Apple device's date to 1 January 1970 will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.\nIn February 2016, a rumor began to spread that iPhones and iPads contain a nifty Easter egg: If you set the date of your Apple product to 1 January 1970 then reboot, it will bring up a retro-themed menu based on the old Apple computer operating systems.\nText on the image read:\nBlast from the past\nThe original Macintosh introduced the world to computers, forever changing the way people experience technology, and allowing people to do things that were never possible before. With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, its a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phones date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablets operating system that youll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so theres not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, its possible  at least in theory  that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says its looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows an iPhone's settings with the date set to January 1, 1970, aligning with the caption's description. The external validation check, however, also shows high confidence (10) but contradicts the caption. It cites Snopes, which debunks the claim that setting the date to January 1, 1970, reveals a retro Easter egg. Snopes states this action might damage the device. This significant conflict necessitates a thorough analysis. The image's internal consistency is undeniable; it shows the described action. However, the external evidence from a reputable source like Snopes strongly refutes the claim's central assertion (the existence of the retro Easter egg). Considering the high confidence of both checks and the authoritative external source (Snopes), the discrepancy resolution favors the external validation.  The claim that setting the date to January 1, 1970 reveals a retro Easter egg is unsubstantiated, based on the information available. Therefore, the caption is out of context, and the confidence is high due to the strong evidence from both the image and the external source.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows high confidence in the image depicting the action mentioned in the caption. External validation, with equally high confidence, contradicts the caption's claim, citing a reliable source (Snopes) which refutes the existence of the Easter egg. The conflict favors the external validation, classifying the caption as out of context."

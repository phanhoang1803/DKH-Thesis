Cameron has a mutated form of leprosy that is so rare, less than one in 600 million people will ever encounter someone who has it.\nThe strain, leprosis metapupalis carnivore, essentially turns its victim into a walking pile of dead skin, rotting flesh, and festering organs while keeping the brain functioning at primal levels and the heart pumping just enough to send diseased blood to the marrow and muscles to allow the person to be mobile.\nThis is not a genuine news item. TheLastLineOfDefense.com is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories, and carries multiple disclaimers labeling its content as fiction:\nIn a cynical world where the news of the day often seems fake, The Last Line of Defense offers today's busy conservative a place to go to read things they'll enjoy and congregate with a bunch of people they agree with. So while everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway.\nDISCLAIMER: Americas Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth.

The article from TheLastLineOfDefense.com, cited by Snopes, is clearly labeled as satire and fiction.  The caption's claim about Kirk Cameron having a rare biblical disease is entirely fabricated.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) that the image shows Kirk Cameron, aligning with the caption's mention of him. However, the internal check acknowledges that the caption's claim about a \"rare biblical disease\" is not visually verifiable. The external check provides strong evidence (score 10) that the caption's claim is false, citing Snopes' debunking of the claim based on its origin from a satirical website.  The high confidence scores from both checks, combined with the clear contradiction between the verifiable (Cameron's presence) and unverifiable (disease claim) aspects of the caption, lead to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The external check significantly outweighs the internal check in terms of reliability, as it relies on verifiable fact-checking, while the internal check focuses only on visual aspects and lacks the factual verification.  The discrepancy lies in the unverifiable claim of the disease.  The external check directly refutes this claim, demonstrating that the caption is inaccurate and misleading in this crucial aspect. In summary, despite the image accurately depicting Kirk Cameron, the caption's central assertion—a rare biblical disease—is completely false, thus making the entire caption out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image shows Kirk Cameron but cannot verify the disease claim. External check strongly refutes the disease claim, labeling it as false information from a satirical source. The combination leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

        "content": "Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Keith Potter caught a purple lobster off the coast of Winter Harbor on Tuesday.  Internal validation reveals a mismatch: the image shows two lobsters, one purple and one orange, and there's no information within the image to support the caption's claim about Keith Potter or the specific event described. The internal check gives a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False.\n\nExternal validation strengthens this assessment.  A Snopes.com article directly debunks the caption.  Snopes reports that the image of the purple lobster was digitally manipulated, and Keith Potter himself admitted on Facebook that it was a hoax created using Photoshop.  Snopes' findings strongly support the image being digitally altered and the story being false, providing a confidence score of 3 and a verdict of False.\n\nThere is a perfect alignment between the internal and external checks.  Both independently conclude that the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The external validation significantly enhances the confidence in the conclusion due to the strong evidence from a reputable source (Snopes.com), which directly addresses the claim made in the caption and provides corroborating evidence from the person supposedly involved (Keith Potter).\n\nThe discrepancies are fully explained by the digital manipulation of the image. The image itself does not provide any evidence to support the caption. The external source explicitly confirms the image's manipulation and refutes the claim. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they consistently point towards the caption being false.\n\nThe combination of internal and external evidence leads to a high confidence level (10 out of 10) that the caption \"Keith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor\" is out of context and factually inaccurate.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks conclusively demonstrate that the caption is false and out of context.  The image shows a digitally manipulated purple lobster, and an external source (Snopes) confirms the image's fakery and the admission of the individual named in the caption."

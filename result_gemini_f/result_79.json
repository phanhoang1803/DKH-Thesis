        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of bombs were dropped on Britain during World War Two, some of which never exploded, so perhaps it should not be a surprise that they are still being found more than 75 years after the end of the war. But how much do we know about them?\nThe discovery of an unexploded World War Two bomb in Exeter resulted in a military response, thousands of residents being evacuated from their homes and extensive damage to nearby properties.\nAfter being discovered on an allotment due for development, the 2,200lb (1,000kg) German bomb was blown up on Saturday in a controlled explosion, leaving a crater the size of three double-decker buses.\nResidents have all been allowed back into their homes but many of the properties are \"uninhabitable\" according to Exeter City Council. About 300 students are still waiting to be allowed back into their accommodation.\nThe BBC has spoken to a series of experts about the wider questions surrounding unexploded ordnance.\nHow did the bomb get there?\nExeter was the first victim of the Baedecker Raids on English cultural centres during World War Two, made in response to the British bombing of Lbeck.\nThe raids were named after the Baedeker guidebook used by the German military to select historic targets in England.\nThe Blitz of Exeter in April and May 1942 \"was the single most destructive event in the city's history since at least the attack by the Vikings in 1003\" said Dr Todd Gray.\nThe historian from the University of Exeter said the recently discovered bomb most likely fell during one of these attacks, when the city was targeted for morale rather than for strategic purposes.\nNearly 300 people died, more than 1,700 buildings were destroyed, 7,000 high explosives and incendiary bombs were dropped and 40 high explosive bombs did not detonate.\nThe sound of the bomb being exploded on Saturday was \"ferocious\", but Dr Gray said he felt \"quite thankful\" to have heard the noise as a reminder of what it would have been like at the time.\n\"That bomb going off reminds us what that generation in 1940s went through,\" said Dr Gray.\n\"It's sobering, but now and then something like this is good for us to think about.\"\nThe bomb was discovered near Exeter St David's railway station in an area not covered by a \"bomb census\".\n\"There's bound to be I would have thought one or two more somewhere,\" he added.\nCould there be more nearby?\nEmily Charles, a World War Two curator at the Imperial War Museum said the exact number of bombs across the country was not known and it was \"really hard\" to work out where unexploded bombs could be.\nThe allies kept a detailed record of bomb damage inflicted on British cities during the war called the bomb census, said Ms Charles.\nThey created maps to show the most damaged areas, which can give historians a \"better picture\" of where unexploded ordnance could be, she added.\nThe most common type of bomb used in the Blitz was about 500lb (226.8kg), meaning the 2,200lb (1,000kg) bomb detonated in Exeter was \"particularly large\" said Ms Charles.\nHowever, she stressed it was \"not uncommonly large\" and bombs of this size had been found in recent years.\nCould they explode?\nA guide on managing the risk of unexploded devices was released by the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) in 2019.\nThe CIRIA guide said ordnance could be reactivated by either direct impact, vibration or heating.\nThe lack of fatalities in instances when construction teams discover unexploded devices \"is particularly because of the Germans commonly using electrical fuses in WW2 that stopped functioning when the battery expired\", said the guide.\n\"What makes unexploded bombs dangerous is their unpredictability,\" said Ms Charles.\nShe told the BBC there were \"not huge scientific studies\" on how explosives degraded or whether they got more deadly over time.\n\"So I think the best course of action is to treat them as if they are deadly.\"\nThat the bomb was detonated in a controlled explosion and houses suffered damage, proves they can still be dangerous, she said.\nThere are multiple reasons that bombs do not detonate upon landing, explained Ms Charles, such as faulty fuses, defects or the way they land.\nShe said people should call the police if they spot any suspected explosive devices.\nHow much is there across the country?\nThe Ministry of Defence says since 2010 it has been involved with making safe 450 German WW2 bombs - about 60 a year, the BBC Reality Check team revealed in 2018.\nHowever, these figures do not factor in the involvement of private companies that can also dispose of unexploded devices.\nThis can make it difficult to establish exact figures for how many are dealt with each year across the country.\nA specialist from one such private company, Zetica UXO, told the BBC that since World War Two \"45,000 unexploded bombs have been found and more are being found all the time\".\nOfficial records, which can often be understated, predicted around \"200,000 plus bombs were detonated\" during the war said Mike Sainsbury.\nHe said it was estimated that \"another 10% or so\" did not explode.\nHow to detonate an unexploded bomb?\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson said explosive ordnance teams from the Royal Navy and Army worked with local authorities to safely dispose of the bomb.\nMilitary teams worked for 24 hours to build protective structures and trenches to minimise the impacts of the blast and used more than \"400 tonnes of sand\" to mitigate the explosion.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check focuses on the image content, noting the presence of a large, rusty bomb consistent with a World War II artifact in what appears to be a residential area in England.  This aligns perfectly with the caption's description. The external check corroborates this with a news source explicitly reporting the controlled detonation of a World War II unexploded bomb found in Exeter, southwest England. The news report details the discovery, evacuation of residents, and the controlled explosion, offering substantial evidence to support the caption's statement. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both yield high confidence scores (10/10).  The alignment between the image, caption, and external news source is impeccable, providing strong evidence to confirm the caption's accuracy.  No further investigation is necessary to reach the conclusion that the caption is not out of context.",

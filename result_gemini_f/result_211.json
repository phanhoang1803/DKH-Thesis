Some joked about this being a real video of a living triceratops, some pondered if it was possible, while others simply wondered what the heck was going on.\nFor starters, this is not a living and breathing triceratops. The rhinoceros-looking dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period  about 68 million years ago  but went extinct along with all other non-avian dinosaurs during the CretaceousPaleogene (KPg) extinction event about 66 million years ago. In other words, it would be unusual to see a living, breathing triceratops in the wild today.\nThis video actually features a triceratops puppet at a dinosaur theme park in Indonesia called Mojosemi Forest Park. While we're not exactly certain how this puppet was created, a longer video from this dino-themed amusement park appears to show that this triceratops is operated possibly by two people inside of an elaborate costume:\nhttps://fb.watch/2oxNZxaLhE/\nWhile some may have taken pause when they first saw the triceratops video, other videos from Mojosemi Forest Park clearly show that dinosaurs have not actually been brought back from extinction.\nhttps://fb.watch/2oyqfR9Klr/",

    "explanation": "The internal check assesses that the caption accurately reflects the visual content of the image: a large animatronic Triceratops being unloaded from a truck in what seems to be Indonesia.  The high confidence score (10) reflects this seemingly straightforward interpretation of the image alone. However, the external check, using a Snopes article, reveals a significant discrepancy.  The external check has a high confidence score of 10, asserting that the video is miscaptioned; it depicts a triceratops puppet at an Indonesian dinosaur theme park, not a living Triceratops.  The external check provides strong supporting evidence (links to videos and a detailed explanation) to back its claims. The conflict between the internal and external checks is substantial. The internal check is based on a purely visual assessment of a single image; it lacks the contextual information available through the external check's investigation. The external check, in contrast, provides extensive contextual information from multiple sources confirming the animatronic nature of the 'triceratops'.  Given that both checks have high confidence scores (10), and the external check supplies substantially more evidence and context, we must prioritize the external check's findings.  The original caption is therefore deemed out of context because it misrepresents the nature of the subject in the image. The image shows an animatronic replica, not a real, living triceratops. The image alone is misleading without the additional information provided by external validation. In summary, although the image appears to align with the caption at first glance, a deeper investigation reveals the caption's inaccuracy. Therefore, the conclusion is that the caption is Out Of Context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence (10) that the caption matches the image. External check shows high confidence (10) that the caption misrepresents the image, identifying the subject as an animatronic puppet, not a living dinosaur.  External evidence is prioritized due to its comprehensive context, making the caption out of context."

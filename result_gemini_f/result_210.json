        "content": "Thousands of climate activists gathered in a stretch of woodland north of Frankfurt on Sunday as a planned motorway extension through the Dannenrder forest pits the autobahn against 250-year-old oak trees.\nAbout 27 hectares (67 acres) of forest are to supposed to cleared by next February to make way for a new 3km stretch of the A49 dual carriageway. Police in the state of Hesse are preparing for months of stand-offs with protesters, who say the erosion of a healthy mixed forest makes a mockery of the German governments ambitious climate targets.\nIt is a catastrophe that such an old forest still has to make way for the autobahn in 2020, said Carola Rackete, an activist who rose to prominence in June 2019 as the captain of migrant rescue ship Sea Watch 3, who has joined the protests. The demonstrators are calling on the government to instead invest in expanding rail transport infrastructure.\nAs forestry workers began to fell the first trees on Thursday to make way for the motorway, police destroyed barricades, treehouses and makeshift platforms built by activists, who have been occupying parts of the forest for the last year.\nOn Friday, police said they had made 16 arrests in the adjacent Herrenwald where the clearing began, including 10 activists who had to be pulled down from treetops via hoisting platforms. In a video posted on social media, masked activists conceded that we have sadly failed to stop the clearing, because there were too few of us.\nBut protests have since proliferated, with activists temporarily occupying the Hessian state representations offices in Berlin on Friday, and about 300 cyclists closing down a section of the south-bound lane of the A49 on Saturday.\nOrganisers said about 5,000 people travelled to the forest on Sunday morning to protest against the motorway plans and to take part in guided nature walks through the threatened woodland. Police put the number of demonstrators at about 2,000.\nWith work on the new motorway not due to begin until September 2021 and the woodland area too large to be closed off from activists, police said they were expecting long-term resistance against the infrastructure project.\nSome of those protesting against the felling at Dannenrder were also involved in demonstrations two years ago at Hambach forest, a stretch of ancient woodland in North-Rhineland Westphalia that was due to make way for a coalmining project.\nThe construction company Deges, tasked with overseeing the construction of the motorway extension, says its project is essential to relieve congested roads and does not pose an existential threat to the stretch of woodland.\nThe company says it will only cut down 3% of the Dannenrder forest, and that old oaks only make up about 8% of the trees due to be felled. In turn, Deges has vouched to reforest 85 hectares of woodland, as well as setting up 10 new pond habitats for the endangered crested newt.\nBut environmental groups say the motorway plans are also symbolic of broader hypocrisy on behalf a German government feted abroad for its climate policies. Some parts of this forest are 250 years old, said Nicola Uhde of the German Federation for the Environment and Nature Conservation (Bund), and there is simply not much of this kind of woodland around any more.\nSpeaking on Wednesday at a United Nations summit on biodiversity, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, had urged countries to turn the tide on a global scale to protect the environment. We have to use land and sea more sustainably and manage them in a more ecologically sound way, she said in a video statement.\nIn the state of Hesse, the fate of the Dannenrder forest is also seen as a litmus test for the Green party, which has for the last two years governed the western state in a coalition with Merkels conservative CDU  a power-sharing deal that could be replicated at a federal level next year.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows a confidence score of 10 because the image depicts a snow plow clearing a road in a snowy forest, aligning with the caption's description. However, the location, \"southern Germany\", cannot be verified from the image alone. The external check provides strong supporting evidence from a reliable news source (theguardian.com).  The article reports on road clearing activities in a forest in Germany on Thursday, corroborating the caption's claim. While the article's specific location is slightly different (north of Frankfurt instead of southern Germany), the overall event and timeframe align. This discrepancy is minor considering the broad geographical reference of \"southern Germany\".  Both checks exhibit high confidence.  The discrepancy between the exact location in the news report and the caption is not significant enough to outweigh the strong supporting evidence.  Overall, the evidence strongly suggests that the caption is not out of context, with minor uncertainty about the precise geographical location. The minor discrepancy in location is accounted for in the confidence score.",

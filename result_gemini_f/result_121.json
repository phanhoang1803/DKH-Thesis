        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

      "explanation": "The provided fact-checking article from Snopes.com directly debunks the claim in the news caption.  The article states that the video is real but miscaptioned; it shows protesters in Hong Kong tearing down a smart lamppost in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic and unrelated to 5G towers or the virus.  The Snopes article thoroughly investigates the origin of the video and its misrepresentation online.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check identifies several inconsistencies: the video doesn't confirm the location as China, the structures being destroyed aren't definitively identified as 5G towers, and there's no visual evidence linking the event to COVID-19.  The confidence score of 7 reflects this uncertainty based solely on the video.  However, the external check provides definitive evidence from a reliable source (Snopes.com) that completely refutes the caption.  Snopes confirms the video's authenticity but clarifies that it depicts protests in Hong Kong in 2019, predating the COVID-19 pandemic, and the structures destroyed were surveillance towers, not 5G towers. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check stems from the thorough investigation and conclusive findings presented by Snopes.  Since both checks align in their conclusion that the caption is inaccurate, and the external check provides strong evidence, the overall confidence score is 10. The discrepancy between the internal check's lower confidence score and the external check's higher score is resolved by prioritizing the external verification, which offers more concrete and reliable evidence.  The absence of supporting evidence for the claims in the original caption, coupled with the strong refutation from Snopes, leads to the unequivocal conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes independently and conclusively determine that the original caption is factually inaccurate and out of context.  The external validation, supported by a reliable source (Snopes.com), provides strong evidence to refute all aspects of the original caption."

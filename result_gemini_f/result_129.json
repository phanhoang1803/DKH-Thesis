        "content": "Claim:\nPilot Flying J is removing American flags from their truck stop flagpoles because the flags \"offend foreigners.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 5 May 2018, Facebook user Dave Moore uploaded a video from a Pilot Flying J truck stop in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that a flagless Flying J location it displayed was the result of the company's attempt to placate \"foreigners\" who would otherwise be offended by the sight of an American flag in the United States (for reasons he did not explicate):\nMoore described (but did not film) a interaction with an unspecified employee who, according to him, openly stated that non-American customers requested that the flag be removed: \"I went inside the Pilot and I asked them ... they said they had an issue with foreigners coming here and complaining, and they didn't want to lose the foreigners' business so they took it down.\"\nIn fact the clip did not corroborate his claim, despite being made directly in front of the Pilot Flying J where he claimed the interaction took place. Although he shot a video directly after the purported conversation, he apparently didn't capture evidence that it happened as described (or at all).\nGas stations are frequently targeted for rumors of insufficient patriotism and various versions of the \"Shunned Serviceman\" urban legend. Modern (mostly invented) repetitions of the such rumors have circulated in Illinois, on Long Island, and in Holly, Michigan.\nIn some e-mailed variations of this rumor which we received, readers asked if Pilot Flying J had announced that they would be removing all American flags, everywhere:\nPilot and Flying J truck stops announced they were taking down the American Flag. They started the American Flag was offensive to the foreign truck drivers. Well screw them I will not stop or use these truck stops or gas stations ever again. I cut up my Pilot rewards gas card.\nAs is often the case with claims about \"offensive\" American flags or unpatriotic gas stations, Moore's story spread quickly, accruing nearly three million views in under a week. One day after it was posted, Pilot Flying J addressed the rumor on social media, stating that the store in question lacked a U.S. flag because a damaged flagpole there was in the process of being repaired:\nIn their Facebook post, Pilot Flying J reported that a \"team member was misinformed,\" but the company did not provide any more detail about the nature of that misinformation.\nA public relations firm representing Flying J sent us a response to our inquiry about the issue which stated that:\nI want to re-iterate that the current policy is that an American flag can only be displayed at our locations if it can be flown according to military protocol. The flag at store #436 in Amarillo, TX was not being flown as the pole is broken and prevents the flag being flown according to protocol.\nWe apologize the store manager did not have this information. We are still investigating all the details behind this miscommunication, but what we can tell you is what the situation at hand truly is, and that we are working to fix the pole at this location and are currently surveying our locations with flag poles to review if they are in proper working condition.",

Snopes reports that Pilot Flying J stated the flag was absent due to a broken flagpole, not an attempt to appease foreigners.  The Snopes article details a Facebook user's false claim and Flying J's response. This makes the verdict false.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no alignment between the image (a Pilot gas station) and the caption's details about a Flying J location in Amarillo, Texas, and a claim regarding placating foreigners. The external check corroborates this by referencing a Snopes article that debunks the claim in the caption, stating that the absence of a flag at the Flying J location was due to a broken flagpole, not an attempt to appease foreigners.  The high confidence scores from both checks (0 for internal and 10 for external) converge to support the conclusion that the caption is entirely fabricated and unrelated to the provided image.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both independently and decisively point towards the caption's inaccuracy.  The internal check focuses on the mismatch between the image content and the caption's specific details, while the external check brings in credible evidence from a fact-checking website to disprove the central claim within the caption. Since both checks align perfectly in confirming the caption's out-of-context nature, the confidence score is set to 10, indicating a high degree of certainty in the final assessment. The discrepancies are clear: image depicts Pilot, caption mentions Flying J, and claims are entirely debunked by Snopes.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support that the caption is out of context. The image shows a Pilot gas station, while the caption falsely describes a Flying J location, wrongly associating it with a claim about placating foreigners. External validation through a Snopes article confirms the caption's inaccuracy."

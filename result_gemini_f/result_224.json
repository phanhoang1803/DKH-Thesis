        "content": "For the second time this term many parents in Scotland are having to cope with the disruption of their child's school being used as a polling place for an election.\nThe UK general election is the sixth time in less than three years that Scotland has gone to the polls.\nThe Electoral Commission, which sets out guidelines for how the election process should be conducted, said it had not received complaints about schools being used as polling places until recent years.\nWhy are schools used for voting?\nHistorically, primary schools were the most likely venue for casting votes because every community has one, according to Mary Pitcaithly, convener of the Electoral Management Board for Scotland (EMB), which has a key role in delivering elections.\nThey are also...\nfree to use\nwithin the control of the local authority\nand comply with public liability health and safety laws.\nMs Pitcaithly told BBC Scotland that, in the past, the electoral cycle would have been expected to throw up two ballots every five years - one for Westminster and one for the local council.\nThis was not considered to be a major problem, she says.\nThe starting point now is to ask if there is another alternative that would not disrupt the education of young children\nHowever, Scottish Parliament elections, European elections and a rise in the use of referendums have increased the number of days lost to school children.\nMs Pitcaithly, who is also the returning officer for Falkirk, says more people have complained in recent years and she has moved her own authority away from using schools.\nShe says Falkirk now only uses \"a handful\" of schools.\n\"The starting point now is to ask if there is another alternative that would not disrupt the education of young children,\" she says.\nAre school days being lost?\nEleanor Coner, from the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, says she thinks local authorities are listening and trying to find alternative venues.\nShe says: \"We should try to have as little disruption to schools as possible. Just because we have always done it does not mean it is right.\"\n\"In large towns and cities I would question whether there is the need to use schools, often there is another community space that could be used.\"\nMs Coner says that this election in particular has been a challenge for parents and schools because it was called at short notice.\nJust because we have always done it does not mean it is right\nTheresa May's announcement of a snap election, three years ahead of schedule, could not have been foreseen by those making arrangements on the ground.\nA spokeswoman for the EIS teachers' union told BBC Scotland the closure of schools on polling days had \"long been the case\" but \"the large number of elections and referendums in recent years has led to a greater number of school days being lost\".\nShe says: \"The closure of schools - at fairly short notice in this case - can have an impact on the learning experience for pupils as well as significant childcare implications for parents.\"\nWhen elections are planned well in advance, such as the local council elections in May, some local authorities choose to schedule teacher in-service days for the day of the ballot.\nThis means that pupils will not miss out on a day of school.\nCan part of the school be kept open?\nIt is commonly thought that using a school as a polling place automatically means it has to close.\nMs Pitcaithly says this does not necessarily have to be the case.\nIf the polling stations can be kept completely separate from the activities of the school then part of the building can still house pupils.\nHowever, that often proves more difficult than it first appears.\nThe polling station area must be securely isolated from the rest of the school, preventing members of the public coming into contact with the children.\nThe way the public gains access to the polling station must also be considered, for instance the need to cross playgrounds or access for voters with disabilities.\nAnd although it is often just one room that is used for casting votes, access to toilets, washrooms and drinking water must be unrestricted.\nWhat are the other options?\nMs Pitcaithly says: \"The difficulty is that there often isn't an alternative. If we use a church hall or a commercial building we need to make sure it fulfils all the requirements such as disabled access.\n\"In Falkirk, we have got a vacant shop premises that we are using for the day but it needs to be cleaned up and fitted out so it is quite an undertaking.\n\"Sometimes portable buildings are used but the difficulty there is that they need to be compliant with the disability act.\"\nShe says it can be costly to set up a polling place for just one day.\nMs Coner, from the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, says local authorities need to be a \"bit more creative\" in finding venues and not stick to what they have always done.\nShe says in East Lothian, where she lives, they have moved away from using schools and now use a local community centre.\n\"We are lucky to have that, not everywhere has one,\" she says.\nSchools are 'last resort'\nMs Pitcaithly says: \"The bottom line is that we don't start with polling places in schools. It is a last resort.\"\nShe says she can't direct other returning officers on how to conduct their polls but she is happy for her Electoral Management Board to \"look again\" at the guidance given on whether schools should be used.",

      "explanation": "The news caption describes a common practice supported by the article.  The article discusses the use of schools as polling places in detail, explaining why they are often used and the challenges associated with it. While the article does not explicitly state that people are *always* standing at the entrance to such schools, it strongly implies that this is a frequent occurrence given that the schools are used for voting and voters would need to enter the building. The article highlights that this practice may cause disruption to schooling, but does not contradict the caption's description.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The caption \"People stand at the entrance to a school used as a polling station\" aligns well with the image and available external information.  Internal validation gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows individuals near a school entrance, handling papers, which is strongly suggestive of a polling station activity. The presence of a smiley face mural doesn't contradict this, as it could be a cheerful addition to the school's exterior or a symbol promoting a positive electoral experience.  External validation provides a confidence score of 8, supporting the claim that schools are commonly used as polling stations. The external source notes that this is a recurring practice, causing temporary school closures. This strongly implies that people would be present at the school entrance during the voting process.  The slight discrepancy in confidence scores is due to the fact that the external source does not explicitly mention people *always* standing at the entrance, while the image depicts exactly that.  However, it's reasonable to infer that the presence of voters at the entrance is likely during voting periods.  Overall, both internal and external evidence converge to support the caption's accuracy. The high confidence scores from both methods, along with strong contextual alignment, indicate a high degree of certainty that the caption is not out of context.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks. The image directly shows the scene described, and the external source contextualizes the setting by explaining that schools frequently serve as polling places.  Therefore, the final conclusion supports the accuracy of the caption with a high level of confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The image clearly shows people near a school entrance, and the external source confirms the frequent use of schools as polling stations, implying the likely presence of voters at the entrance. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) indicate strong agreement and justify a high overall confidence level."

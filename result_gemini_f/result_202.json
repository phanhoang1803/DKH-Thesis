It purported that on her first full day in office, Harris had threatened that \"we will use federal law enforcement and the military\" against \"Trumpers ... [who] will beg me for a loaf of bread\":\nThese Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, its time to end this. They really dont get. We will block them in the courts, we will use federal law enforcement and the military. After Joe inflicts the death blow, Ill take the reigns [sic]. They will beg me for a loaf of bread.\nWe found no documentation that Harris said any such thing, however. Such controversial comments certainly would have been widely reported, yet a simple search turns up not a single related news account. Nor did any similar statement appear in Harris' social media accounts or in White House briefing room statements.\nThe meme claims the statement in question was made on Jan. 21, the first full day of the Biden-Harris administration, but Harris' recorded events that day were speaking briefly to the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting (during which she made no such comments) and participating in a call with World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHarris had delivered her first speech as vice president the day before, on Inauguration Day, but in that address she made no mention of former President Donald Trump or his supporters.\nBecause we could find no evidence whatsoever of this quotation's being legitimate, we rate this item \"False.\"",

Snopes finds no evidence to support the claim that Vice President Kamala Harris threatened to use federal law enforcement and the military against Trump supporters.  The Snopes article details a search that yielded no related news accounts or social media posts from Harris supporting this claim.  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably false.",

    "explanation": "The caption is demonstrably false and completely out of context.  The internal check flags a mismatch between the image (Biden signing documents) and the caption's claim (Harris's threat).  The internal check gives a confidence score of 8 because, while the image does show Biden, it lacks the context of Harris's alleged threat. The external check, however, decisively refutes the caption with a confidence score of 10.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, finds absolutely no evidence supporting the claim that Vice President Harris made such a threat. Their investigation yielded zero related news accounts, social media posts, or official statements from Harris corroborating the claim.  The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved easily here, as the external validation provides irrefutable evidence of the caption's falsity.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check significantly outweighs the lower confidence score (8) from the internal check.  The internal check correctly identifies that the image does not visually align with the narrative presented in the caption. Still, the conclusive evidence of falsity offered by the external validation is stronger, leading to the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context.  There is no ambiguity.  The image portrays Biden signing documents, an action unrelated to the false statement attributed to Harris in the caption.   External sources offer compelling evidence to prove the inaccuracy of the caption, making it completely out of context with the provided image. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context with a high degree of confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks confirm the caption is out of context. The internal check notes the image-caption mismatch, while the external check definitively refutes the caption's central claim using a reputable fact-check source. The high confidence scores from both checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and unrelated to the image."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video documents the U.S. Navy's wasteful practice of launching pickup trucks into the water.\nOn 9 February 2019, the Facebook page \"The Other 98%\" posted a video that supposedly showed a truck being launched via a catapult off the deck of the USS Gerald Ford. The video was accompanied by a message suggesting that the United States could easily afford to pay for the Green New Deal proposed in Congress or Medicare for all since the Navy was wasting so much money dumping trucks into the water:\nThe text overlaid on the video reads: \"Trucks were just launched off the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to test its jet catapult system. Don't ever let anyone tell you we can't afford Medicare for all or the Green New Deal.\"\nSeveral things are wrong with this assertion:\nThis incident didn't \"just\" happen. The video is from 2015.\nThe object being launched is not a commercially available truck. This is actually a weighted sled (referred to by the Navy as a dead load).\nThese sleds can be retrieved from the bottom of the river.\nEconomic estimates for the proposed Green New Deal or Medicare for All vary, but they can't be compared to the cost of a few wasted pickup trucks.\nThis viral clip originated with a video uploaded to the U.S. Navy's YouTube page in 16 June 2015 and shows a test of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), a catapult system designed to launch aircraft. At the time, the Navy was using dead loads to mimic the weight of an aircraft:\nHere's a better look at the \"truck\" in the video:\nThe viral Facebook video suggests that the Navy was being wasteful, as these \"trucks\" were lost and left to decay in the water. But that's not always the case. These tests were conducted in the relatively shallow waters of the James River (as opposed to the ocean) and can usually be retrieved for additional tests. A contemporary report from Engadget noted that this specific sled (which was not equipped with any electronics, an engine, or any other especially expensive materials) was recovered from the James River:\nThe Navy has been testing the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System or EMALS for months aboard the Gerald R. Ford carrier, but this is the first time a \"dead-load\" (or a weighted steel sled that weighs up to 80,000 pounds) is involved. Its advantages over traditional catapults that use steam instead of electromagnetic energy include smoother acceleration and its ability to place less stress on the aircraft -- plus, it was designed to work even with more advanced carriers that the military will surely use in the future. It will take a long time before any plane goes near the system, though: the Navy has already retrieved the sled above from the depths of the James River to conduct more dead-load launches.\nIn July 2017, the first fixed-wing airplane was launched using EMALS:\nWhile one could certainly argue that the U.S. government wastes money on certain projects that would be better spent on more worthwhile endeavors, this viral Facebook video isn't the best example to support this argument. This \"truck\" is actually a weighted sled and wasn't lost to the water.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a significant discrepancy: the image shows an aircraft carrier, but the caption claims a truck is being launched via a catapult. This is not depicted in the image. The internal check has a confidence score of 10, indicating high certainty in its assessment. The external check, while confirming an event occurred on the USS Gerald Ford involving a launch, reveals that it was a weighted sled, not a truck, as described in the caption.  This aligns with the image's lack of a truck being launched. The external check's confidence score is 8, indicating substantial confidence.  Both checks concur that the caption misrepresents the image content. The misrepresentation is not simply a minor detail; it concerns the primary subject of the caption. The external source's clarification of the launch as a weighted sled, meant for testing purposes, strongly suggests that the original caption is not merely inaccurate but fundamentally misleading.  There is a strong alignment between the internal analysis of the image and the external fact-checking resource, which corroborates the finding that the original caption is significantly out of context.  The high confidence scores of both internal (10) and external (8) checks, combined with the substantial nature of the discrepancy, lead to a high overall confidence score of 9. The differences between \"truck\" and \"weighted sled\" are substantial enough that it is reasonable to deem the original caption as inaccurate and misleading, and not merely a simple error of description. The entity analysis shows that the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford is correctly identified in both the image and the external verification, but the object of launch is radically different (truck versus weighted sled). Therefore, the high degree of alignment between the internal and external validations supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the original caption is inaccurate. The internal check points out that the image does not show a truck being launched, while the external check reveals that the launched object was a weighted sled, not a truck.  Both checks have high confidence scores, leading to a high overall confidence that the caption is out of context."

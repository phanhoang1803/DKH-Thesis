        "content": "Claim:\nA video clip shows supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders failing to identify a single country on an unlabeled world map.\nOn Feb. 17, 2020, Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map  with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\nCruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernies base,\" implied  if not directly asserted  that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\nThis is Bernies base  the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment  no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\nKimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim in the news caption. While the video shows individuals failing to identify countries, Snopes points out that these individuals were not identified as Bernie Sanders supporters, contradicting the caption's assertion.  The context of the video is crucial; it originated from a comedy segment, and the participants were randomly selected, not specifically chosen for their political affiliations.  Therefore, the caption's claim lacks sufficient evidence.  Although the video depicts the event as described, the key element linking the individuals to Bernie Sanders' support is unsubstantiated.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check reveals a significant discrepancy: while the image shows an individual who might be perceived as a Bernie Sanders supporter,  it lacks evidence to support the claim about Sanders supporters' inability to identify countries on an unlabeled world map.  The lack of context within the image alone lowers the confidence significantly. The external check corroborates this by citing a Snopes article and statements from Jimmy Kimmel himself.  These sources indicate that the participants in the video were randomly selected and not specifically identified as Bernie Sanders supporters. The crucial point is that the caption connects the individuals shown in the video to Bernie Sanders' supporters without providing sufficient supporting evidence.  The internal check, focused on the image, highlights the absence of evidence connecting the individuals to Sanders' supporters. The external check provides compelling evidence from reliable sources directly contradicting this connection. This convergence of independent verification methods increases our confidence in concluding that the caption is indeed out of context. The confidence score is high (9) because both checks concur and provide substantial support. The internal check's lower confidence score (10) is due to the limited information in the single image, whereas the external check's higher confidence (7) is attributed to the use of multiple sources (Snopes and Kimmel's statements) in its analysis. While the image could potentially be a frame from a video depicting the event mentioned in the caption, the caption's crucial assertion – the link between the individuals and Bernie Sanders' support – is unsupported. Therefore, relying solely on the image is insufficient to validate the claim. The external validation greatly enhances our confidence by supplying substantial supporting evidence and contextual information that rectifies this gap. Considering both perspectives, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is strongly supported and warrants a high confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check highlights the lack of evidence within the image to support the claim about Sanders supporters. The external check uses Snopes and Kimmel's statements to confirm that participants were randomly selected, not specifically identified as Sanders supporters.  The key discrepancy is the unsupported link between participants and Bernie Sanders' support, making the caption inaccurate."

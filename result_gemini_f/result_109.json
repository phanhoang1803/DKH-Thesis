        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

      "explanation": "The provided article from Snopes.com investigates an image that went viral, supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste.  However, the article concludes that the image is miscaptioned; the brown clouds are actually sand and mud churned up by the ship's turbines before dropping anchor, not human waste. While the article does discuss cruise ship waste disposal methods, it doesn't directly support the claim in the news caption.  Therefore, the caption is not supported by the provided article. The confidence score is relatively low because only one article is provided, and it directly contradicts the caption's claim.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 3, notes that the image shows a cruise ship near a sandy area but lacks visual evidence of waste dumping.  The external check, with a higher confidence score of 4, uses a Snopes article to confirm that the brown clouds in the water are not human waste, but rather sand and mud stirred up by the ship's turbines. This finding directly contradicts the caption's claim.\n\nThe discrepancy between the confidence scores is due to the nature of the evidence. The internal check relies solely on visual inspection of the image, which provides limited information about waste disposal activities. The external check, on the other hand, leverages an independent investigation by Snopes, which adds significant weight to the conclusion. The higher confidence score reflects the stronger evidence from the external source.\n\nThe Snopes article is crucial in determining the accuracy of the caption. It provides specific details about the circumstances of the photo, identifying the location (Punta del Este, Uruguay) and explaining the brown clouds as sand and mud churned up by the ship's turbines during the anchoring process. This explanation directly refutes the caption's assertion that the ship is dumping human waste.\n\nThere is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently arrive at the same conclusion: the image does not depict a cruise ship dumping human waste.  Both the lack of visual evidence in the image itself (internal check) and the factual account from a reputable source (external check) reinforce this conclusion. There is no need for entity analysis to resolve discrepancies as both methods converge on the same assessment.\n\nIn summary, both internal and external checks provide robust evidence that the caption is incorrect, with the external check providing stronger support due to its reliance on independent verification.  The high overall confidence score reflects the overwhelming evidence supporting the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm that the caption is inaccurate. The image shows a cruise ship near a sandy area, but there's no evidence of waste dumping.  An external investigation (Snopes) clarifies that the brown clouds are sand and mud, not human waste."

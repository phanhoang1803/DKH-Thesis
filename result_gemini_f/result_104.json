        "content": "On East 11th Street in New Yorks East Village, tucked between first and second avenue is Casey Rubber Stamp storefront. It is small, just like the store itself. Blink and youll miss it.\nHello! John Casey calls out to a customer from a sea of small stamps. He doesnt need to speak loudly as the store is cozy. If you have any questions, just shout, he adds in a thick Irish brogue.\nCaseys stamp store is the type youd expect to find nestled in a small rural town. Its filled with small treasures in the form of small stamps that have been handmade with care. Yet here it is in the East Village, just a stones throw away from Broadway. It continues to survive in a neighborhood where, in the last three months, median sales prices of homes reached $2.2m, up 122% in just one year, according to Trulia.\nCasey has watched as other New York stamp shops have shuttered their doors. Three rubber stamp places in the city have gone out of business in the last year and a half, he says. A friend of mine closed down in September. Then two others: one closed in the spring and the other closed late last year.\nBut he holds out hope that the charm of his work will still resonate with customers in an age when most graphics are going digital.\nSticking with simple equipment and focusing mostly on design is what has kept him in business, says Casey, who refers to his stamp-making business as old school.\nPeople say: Oh, computers are going to put you out of business. Instinctively, I know that the graphic people will like to get their hands wet, actually hold something tangible than just touch a computer screen. This has a niche that will last quite a while, he says. Its not the business it used to be. But theres enough of a market for this other thing.\nThat doesnt mean his shop hasnt changed with the times. Originally, most of Caseys revenue came from the sale of the collection of his stamps, consisting of more than 15,000 designs. But with each passing year, he has shifted into more custom work. And his custom business has grown, accounting for an increasing amount of his revenue compared to the sale of the stamps on display, awaiting purchase.\nToday, his revenue is split evenly between those and the custom-design stamp work done in the store, he says. A one-square-inch stamp costs about $20.\nWhether that will be enough to keep him in business over the next few years remains to be seen.\nCasey has been in the stamp-making business for about 35 years and has been based out of the East Village for more than 12.\nA lot has changed in the past years few years, especially the rent. Recently, the average asking price for retail space in Manhattan reached $149 per square foot, up from $130 in 2013, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. South of 14th street where Caseys shop is located, the average asking price is slightly lower at $135 per square foot, up from $123 in 2013.\nSince October 2008, the NYC Small Business Congress has been trying to get the city council to pass the Small Business Jobs Survival Act, which focuses on simplifying commercial lease renewal. The act is supposed to help establish guidelines for lease renewal and eliminate all formulas established to trigger arbitration in the commercial lease renewal process. Most recently, in June 2014, the bill was reintroduced by council member Annabel Palma.\nLandlords will kill you, Casey says, chuckling. He has had a few run-ins with his landlady this past years, but thats all sorted out now. Bureaucracies will kill you. Typical hates of any small business.\nThe rising rents are certainly a cause of concern for Casey, but the small-business owner, who learned most of what he knows on his own, hopes to stick around. Despite the headaches of running a small business, Casey cant imagine closing down or selling out,even if someone walked in and offered to buy it at a good price.\nWhy would I? What am I going to do? Its like winning the lottery, he says. What would I do tomorrow morning? Get new friends?\nClose to the register is a box of stamps adorned with logos of local business, including one for B cup cafe around the block. Casey says a lot of his business comes from small business  like Jojos Sriracha  that want logos for labels and letterheads. Sometimes big companies want stamps for test marketing: they are quick, simple and do the job. Other commissions include local artists who want stamps of their art to sell on Etsy.\nCaseys favorite customer? Children, who never pick what their parents expect them to.\nBasically, we produce a very simple low-tech item that does a very high-quality job in a limited but interesting way, he says.\nHe seems to be good-humored about everything, even his past mistakes. When asked if he has regrets, he says: Of course, tons. I am not Frank Sinatra. He had a few, but too few to mention. I have too many, too many to mention.\nBut he does mention one: not having a business mentor.\nAmong the few things he has learned running a business on his own is that it helps to be frugal and that luck matters.\nIve always said that the difference between success and failure is being right 55% of the time. You have to be lucky. Luck goes a long way. Serendipity goes a long way, but luck certainly does, he says. Being in the right place at the right time and making a couple of right decisions can give one an edge, he adds, whereas few small decisions can break you.\nFor now, Casey seems to be staying lucky, and remaining one of the hidden treasures of New Yorks East Village.",

      "explanation": "The news caption mentions a postal worker in the East Village of Manhattan.  Source 1, from The Guardian, discusses a rubber stamp shop owner, John Casey, in the East Village. While not explicitly a postal worker, the article details Casey's business and location, strongly suggesting the existence of individuals working in the East Village, including those who might be postal workers. The article's focus on a specific business within the neighborhood supports the general truth of the caption, though it does not directly confirm the existence of a postal worker. ",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1:  \"On East 11th Street in New York's East Village, tucked between first and second avenue is Casey Rubber Stamp storefront.\" This establishes the existence of businesses and therefore, likely workers, in the specified location.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a confidence score of 10, stating that the image is consistent with the caption's description.  The image clearly shows a postal worker, and the urban setting is consistent with the East Village in Manhattan. The only minor inconsistency is the lack of explicit geographical markers in the image itself confirming the East Village location.  However, the visual context strongly suggests a New York City setting.\n\nThe external validation check gives a confidence score of 8, providing supporting evidence from an article mentioning businesses in the East Village. While not directly confirming the presence of a postal worker, the article indirectly supports the plausibility of a postal worker in the specified location. The presence of other businesses implies the existence of workers in that area, including likely postal workers. The article's focus on a specific business increases the likelihood of the claim being generally true, though not definitive.  It's important to note that this is corroborative, circumstantial evidence, not direct proof.\n\nThere is a slight discrepancy between the two confidence scores. The internal check is more confident due to the direct visual evidence of a postal worker in an urban environment. The external check provides reasonable supporting evidence but lacks direct confirmation. Considering both checks, the weight is heavily towards supporting the caption. The internal visual confirmation is highly significant, and the external evidence adds contextual support.\n\nThe entity alignment is accurate. The entities of \"postal worker\" and \"East Village, Manhattan\" are both present in both the image and the caption. There is no conflict or contradiction between the entities present.  The only uncertainty is about the exact geographic location, but the context strongly suggests it's consistent with the caption. \n\nGiven the high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) and the strong entity alignment, we can conclude that the caption is not out of context. The combination of strong visual evidence (internal check) and contextual support (external check) provides a strong basis for confidence. A conservative judgment is to rate the overall confidence at 9, reflecting the slight uncertainty about the precise geographic location.  The absence of explicit geographical markers in the image slightly reduces the overall confidence score but does not negate the compelling evidence presented by the image and the external supporting context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption, with high confidence scores.  The internal check provides strong visual evidence, and the external check provides supporting contextual information. The slight discrepancy in confidence scores is due to the lack of explicit geographical markers in the image to confirm the location. Overall, the caption is not out of context."

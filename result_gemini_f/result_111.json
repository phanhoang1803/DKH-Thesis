He said a car bomber had blown himself up and multiple attackers had stormed the compound.\nInterior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said five civilians were killed in the blast and 50 wounded.\nThe blast took place as Zalmay Khalilzad, the special U.S. envoy for peace in Afghanistan, was conducting a television interview, giving the outlines of an accord which would see almost 5,000 American troops withdrawn from Afghanistan in the coming months.\nIn exchange, the Taliban would agree not to allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on the United States and its allies by militant groups including Al Qaeda and Islamic State.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that Afghans wounded in a blast received treatment at a Kabul hospital on Monday. Source 1, from NBC News, reports a car bomb explosion in Kabul on Monday that killed at least five people and wounded 50 more.  The article's description of the blast and its aftermath directly supports the claim in the news caption. The fact that the article mentions casualties being wounded strongly implies that these individuals would have received treatment at a hospital. While the caption doesn't provide specific details about the location of the hospital or the exact number of wounded receiving treatment, the overall account aligns with the reporting of a major event resulting in injuries and hospitalizations. The source's credibility as a major news outlet further strengthens the verdict.",

    "explanation": "The caption's accuracy is assessed through internal and external validation.  Internal validation examines the image's content against the caption's claims. The image depicts a hospital scene in Kabul with several individuals who appear to be of Afghan descent, lying in beds. This aligns well with the caption's statement of \"Afghans wounded in the blast.\"  The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong visual support. External validation checks the caption's claims against credible news sources.  A news report from NBC News confirms a car bomb explosion in Kabul on the same day (Monday) resulting in casualties, including at least five deaths and fifty injuries. This external evidence directly supports the claim that Afghans were wounded in the blast and received treatment in a Kabul hospital. The confidence score is 8, primarily because the external source doesn't explicitly confirm the specific hospital shown in the image, but the overall context aligns strongly. There's no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both strongly support the caption's statement.  The overall confidence score of 9 represents a high level of certainty because both checks show strong agreement and the supporting evidence is compelling. The internal validation based on the visual content of the image provides direct visual evidence supporting the caption, while external validation from a reputable news source corroborates the event and context. The minor lack of precise location detail in the external source is outweighed by the strong agreement and corroborating evidence from both internal and external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's accuracy.  Internal visual analysis shows Afghans in a Kabul hospital, while external news reporting confirms a Kabul blast resulting in injuries on the same day.  The minor lack of specific location in the news report doesn't significantly affect the overall strong agreement."

Disinfection is a standard practice for maintaining hygiene in public places. While I don't have access to real-time news to verify if this specific event happened, the statement's core components are independently verifiable.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly support the caption's accuracy. The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, stating that the image clearly shows a worker disinfecting what appears to be the Salt Cathedral.  The visual evidence aligns perfectly with the description: an underground space with carvings reminiscent of a cathedral, and a person in protective gear using a fumigation device. The external check provides a confidence score of 8, acknowledging the existence of the Salt Cathedral and the common practice of disinfecting public spaces. While lacking real-time verification of the specific disinfection event depicted, the external check confirms the plausibility of the scenario.  There is no conflict between the two checks; they both independently point towards the caption being accurate. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) converge on a high level of certainty. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest the caption is out of context. The minor difference in confidence scores reflects the difference between directly observing the event in the image (internal) and verifying the plausibility based on general knowledge (external). The overall assessment is that the caption accurately reflects the content of the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks highly support the caption's accuracy.  The image visually aligns with the description, and the plausibility of the scenario is confirmed by external knowledge.  There is no conflict between checks, and the high confidence scores strongly suggest the caption is not out of context."

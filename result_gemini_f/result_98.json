        "date": "2024-07-24T00:00:00",
        "content": "The law enforcement officer spent months methodically gathering evidence. He leafed through thousands of pages and highlighted key passages amid reams and reams of paper. He wore his body camera to record his interactions with witnesses and suspects. And he photographed what he saw as instruments of the alleged crime:\nBooks.\nThe targets of the investigation? Three school librarians in Granbury, Texas. The allegation? They had allowed children to access literature  such as The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison  that the officer, Scott London, a chief deputy constable, had deemed obscene.\nIn an extraordinary look into the ramifications of the right-wing backlash against books dealing with racism, gender, sex and sexuality, an 824-page investigative file obtained by NBC News and NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth shows how, for two years, London vigorously pursued felony charges against librarians in the Granbury Independent School District.\nLondon secured subpoenas, filed public records requests, received names of students whod checked out certain books and, after a year, wrote draft criminal complaints.\nThose charges  distributing harmful material to a minor  were never filed. The investigation came to an end in June after Hood County District Attorney Ryan Sinclair turned down Londons request to indict the librarians, citing a lack of conclusive evidence to charge them with felonies.\nSinclair declined to be interviewed and did not respond to written questions. London, who has ties to the anti-government constitutional sheriffs movement and tried to launch a local chapter of the far-right Oath Keepers militia in 2020, did not respond to questions.\nNBC News is not naming the three librarians because they were never charged with a crime. None of them agreed to be interviewed. Granbury Superintendent Jeremy Glenn declined to comment. The district released a statement saying officials looked forward to putting the matter behind them.\nGranbury ISD respects the due diligence of the district attorney and wholeheartedly agrees that this investigation was without merit, it said.\nLondons investigative file offers the most detailed and visceral picture to date of an attempt to prosecute librarians amid the nationwide campaign by conservatives to restrict childrens access to books depicting sex and LGBTQ people.\nAs London was conducting his probe, at least 18 states considered bills to make it easier to prosecute librarians over contested books, and three  Missouri, Indiana and Arkansas  passed them into law, although Arkansas is on hold pending a lawsuit filed by a group of libraries. Police and sheriffs deputies have been called by parents and right-wing activists to investigate library books in Florida, Missouri, South Carolina and elsewhere, but free speech advocates and librarian organizations say they are unaware of any librarian or school official who has been charged over books.\nIts as if books have become contraband, and its just so alarming, said Kasey Meehan, who leads a freedom to read campaign at PEN America, a free speech nonprofit.\nA series of videos captured by Londons body-worn camera in May 2022 show him striding through school hallways, interviewing administrators and perusing library shelves in search of the offending books.\nIn one video, a middle school librarian leans over a book check-out counter, her hands folded at her mouth, as London lays out the legal basis for his investigation. On the wall behind the librarian are colorful decorations and a quote from Dr. Seuss: The more things you read, the more things you will know.\nTheres been an allegation of books that were in conflict of the penal code in the library, London tells the librarian, and so thats what Im looking into.\nLondon says he has some questions, but under the Fifth Amendment, the librarian is not obligated to answer them.\nI really dont want to at the moment, she says, shaking her head.\nIn another video, London lays out several books on a library table and photographs their covers and copyright pages  logging each as evidence of a potential crime.\nAdam Steinbaugh, a lawyer for the civil liberties nonprofit the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, said the Granbury investigation stands out from other cases hes tracked. Steinbaugh obtained a copy of Londons investigative file through a public records request.\nThis was the first time, he said, that his organization had seen a law enforcement official issue subpoenas and receive records showing how often books had been checked out and by whom, and the first time hed seen an officer draft criminal complaints against librarians. Watching police body camera footage of school librarians being confronted by an investigator was deeply unsettling, Steinbaugh said.\nAnytime youre talking about arresting a librarian for the content of books in a library, thats going to have a chilling effect, he said. Why be a librarian? Why take the, frankly, little pay that librarians, especially school librarians, get, and risk going to prison?\nGranburys battle over school library books began in early 2022. That January, Glenn, Granburys superintendent, directed librarians to remove books that contained descriptions of sex and LGBTQ storylines, according to a secret recording obtained by NBC News, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. The district later appointed a panel of community volunteers to review dozens of books that a Republican state legislator had flagged as inappropriate.\nIn the end, the committee members voted to permanently ban just three of the titles, including This Book Is Gay, a coming-out guide for LGBTQ teens by transgender author Juno Dawson that includes detailed descriptions of sex, and returned the others to shelves.\nThe decision outraged a pair of conservative Christian parents who served on the review committee  a homeschooling mother named Monica Brown and Karen Lowery, who was later elected to Granburys school board.\nOn May 2, 2022, according to a case summary included in Londons investigative file, Brown and Lowery brought their concerns about pornography in school libraries to him. They filed a complaint naming 11 allegedly obscene books that they said could be found in Granbury school libraries. The titles, all of which contained passages about sex or rape, included a popular teen fantasy series by Sarah J. Maas and a pair of books by the acclaimed young adult author Tiffany D. Jackson.\nThe idea that school librarians had been handing out pornography in a town like Granbury  where many folks identify as conservative Christians and 80% of county residents voted for Donald Trump in 2020  seemed far-fetched to some locals, but London committed himself to investigating.\nIn an interview with NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth that aired last year, London said the probe was simply a response to the complaint from Lowery and Brown and not driven by his own views.\nIf a crime is reported to any law enforcement agency, I would expect the law enforcement agency to investigate the crime, he said.\nLowery, however, said in an email to reporters last year that it was London who asked if she and Brown would file the complaint after he heard them speak about library books at a local Republican club.\nMonica and I agreed to do so believing we should support law enforcement, Lowery wrote to NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth.\nA day after taking their complaint, London made his first visits to Granburys administrative offices, and later that week to Granbury High School and a pair of middle schools.\nBody camera footage shows London making small talk with administrators and repeating a joke about being more of a math guy when he was a pupil.\nIn one encounter with superintendent Glenn, on May 3, 2022, London explained his approach to the case.\nJust because I work for the government, I cant go give a 13-year-old a Hustler magazine, London said. If youre showing pictures of a vagina covered in boils, its part of sex ed, you can justify it. But if its smut for smuts sake, its not justified.\nIn each of his meetings with the three librarians, London explained that they were under no obligation to speak with him. One by one, the librarians declined to answer questions.\nIll listen to what you have to say, one librarian told London, laughing nervously.\nI was told not to say anything unless I have legal, another told him.\nPaul Hyde, a Granbury attorney who served on the volunteer committee tasked with reviewing dozens of school library books, said he informally advised two of the accused librarians early in Londons investigation and saw the toll it has taken on them.\nThese women, that are amazing educators and librarians, have been terrified for over two years now that theyre going to get arrested, hauled off to jail on a felony charge of providing pornography to minors, Hyde said, noting that one of the librarians left the district as a result.\nWe lost a great librarian, he said.\nAs the investigation progressed, London reviewed nearly 200 pages of community member complaints about books available in the Granbury district, many of which cited BookLooks, a website tied to the conservative activist group Moms for Liberty.\nHe reported purchasing each of the 11 titles named in Lowery and Browns police report and, over the course of a few months in 2022, read them in their entirety. His investigative file included more than 120 photos of passages he believed to be obscene, with highlights he made with a marker.\nLondon also secured subpoenas for Follett School Solutions, an education software company that Granbury uses to help manage its library collection, to obtain records for the dates and times that several titles were checked out from campus libraries.\nSome of the records in London's investigative file included the names of students who had most recently checked out the books  a clear violation of student privacy, according to First Amendment experts. It is not clear who provided those records to London.\nA Follett spokesperson said in an email, At no time did Follett provide any data that included student names or other student information.\nLondon also sought records from the district about student volunteers who helped librarians return books to shelves. According to the case records, London believed that if he could prove that librarians used minors in the commission of the alleged crimes, it would elevate the charges from misdemeanors to felonies.\nAfter investigating for more than a year, in July 2023, London submitted the case file to Sinclair, the district attorney. By then, London had launched a campaign for Hood County sheriff  an election he would ultimately lose.\nHe included in his report to Sinclair drafts of criminal complaints to charge the librarians with distributing harmful material to minors, citing sections of books in which sexual acts were described.\nLondon named six books from Brown and Lowerys original list that he deemed worthy of charges:\nThree titles from the fantasy series A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas, which include descriptions of sexual encounters.\nGone, a book about the consequences of an inappropriate sexual relationship between a 17-year-old and his teacher, by Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson.\nFade, a title by Lisa McMann in which a teen with supernatural abilities investigates sexual predators at a high school.\nAnd The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, a book about a Black girl in the 1940s who internalizes the notion that whiteness is the standard for beauty and whose struggles are exacerbated by rape and abuse.\nNearly one year later, Sinclair notified London that his office wasnt going to prosecute the case, according to an email exchange last month between London and Sinclair that was included in the investigative file. (The documents released to NBC News and NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth did not include a copy of Sinclairs letter declining to file charges, which London said was exempt from disclosure, but they did include follow-up emails describing the prosecutors decision and reasoning.)\nSinclair rejected the felony case because there was insufficient evidence to prove that the librarians used minors to distribute, exhibit, or display harmful materials, according to the emails. And at that point, the two-year statute of limitations had expired for misdemeanor charges.\nBased on Londons reply, it seemed Sinclair also was not convinced that the books, taken as a whole, met the states legal definition of harmful material.\nOn May 1, London made a final plea to get Sinclair to indict the librarians.\nAfter reading each of these books personally in their entirety, London wrote in a letter included in the investigative file, I cannot fathom any scientific, educational, governmental, or other similar justifications for some of these books.\nUltimately, Sinclair was not persuaded.\nOn June 24, London wrote to Glenn, letting the Granbury superintendent know that it was official: His two-year effort to charge school librarians had ended.\nBrown, one of the mothers who filed the complaint, did not respond to messages requesting comment. Lowery, who continues to serve on Granburys school board, responded to the cases dismissal by defending her efforts to restrict library books.\nI did what I believe I was called to do to make the community aware of this dangerous issue, she said in a statement.\nDeborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Associations Office for Intellectual Freedom, said the case demonstrates the risks librarians now face and the importance of prosecutorial restraint.\nWe do cling to the fact that no prosecutor has accepted this information to create a criminal prosecution, Caldwell-Stone said. Were just concerned that someday someone might choose to do it.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows some confidence in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy. The external check found no relevant information connecting the image to the caption's description of an old man leaning against his truck in Granby.  The external search instead returned results about a completely unrelated legal battle in Granbury, Texas, which is a different location and subject matter.  This stark contrast between internal visual assessment and the absence of corroborating external evidence strongly suggests the caption is out of context. The low confidence score reflects the substantial uncertainty introduced by the mismatch between the internal and external validation results.  The image depicts a scene consistent with a man in a rural area, potentially near a wildfire, while the original caption focuses only on the man and his truck, omitting the significant environmental element present in the image.  The discrepancy between the location mentioned (Granby) and the location found in external searches (Granbury) is a further indication of potential mislabeling or misidentification.  In the absence of confirming evidence, a conservative approach is to assume the caption is out of context, especially given the high level of disagreement between internal and external validation. This conclusion is based on the lack of supportive external evidence, despite the image seeming consistent with a part of the caption (an older man by a truck). Overall, the low confidence score reflects the difficulty in confidently verifying the caption's accuracy due to the contradictory information from the external search.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows some visual consistency; external check finds no supporting evidence; significant location discrepancy (Granby vs. Granbury); caption omits important image context (wildfire); overall, strong evidence suggests caption is out of context."

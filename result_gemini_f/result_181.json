        "content": "The president won about 73% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, Moise Katumbi, on 18%, officials said.\nThe 20 December election was marred by widespread logistical problems.\nIt had to be extended to a second day in some parts of the vast country.\nAbout two-thirds of polling stations opened late, while 30% of voting machines did not work on the first day of the vote, according to an observer group.\nMillions of people waited for hours before they were able to vote, while some gave up and went home.\nThe opposition said the problems were part of a deliberate plan to allow the results to be rigged in favour of Mr Tshisekedi, 60.\nSeveral of the main challengers have called for protests after Sunday's announcement.\n\"We call on our people to take to the streets en masse after the proclamation of the electoral fraud,\" they said in a joint statement.\nThe army has been deployed in various parts of the capital, Kinshasa, to prevent any unrest, while Mr Tshisekedi's supporters have taken to the streets to celebrate.\nThe head of the election commission has previously said the opposition candidates wanted a new election because \"they know they lost... they are bad losers\".\nElection chief Denis Kadima acknowledged some irregularities but insisted that the results reflected the will of the Congolese people.\nPresident Tshisekedi will be sworn in for a second term on 20 January.\nThe son of veteran opposition leader tienne Tshisekedi, the president was first elected in 2019.\nThat followed a poll which some observers, including the influential Catholic Church, said was won by former oil executive Martin Fayulu. He came third in this election with 5% of the vote.\nNone of the other 16 candidates gained more than 1% of the vote.\nMr Kadima said turnout was about 43% of the 41 million registered voters.\nIt is not clear if any of the 18 opposition candidates will challenge the results in court. Mr Katumbi has already said it is not worth it, because the courts are not independent.\nThe Constitutional Court has 10 days to hear any legal challenges before it is due to announce the final results on 10 January 2024.\nDR Congo is roughly four times the size of France, but lacks basic infrastructure. Even some of its main cities are not linked by road.\nAbout two-thirds of the country's 100 million population live below the poverty line, earning $2.15 (1.70) a day or less.\nVoters also chose parliamentary, provincial and municipal representatives, with about 100,000 candidates in total.\nDuring the campaign, Mr Tshisekedi repeatedly lashed out at Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, who he accuses of backing the M23 rebel group which has seized territory in the east of the country. Rwanda has repeatedly denied the charges.\nIn his last election rally, Mr Tshisekedi vowed to declare war on Rwanda, although observers dismissed this as rhetoric aimed at whipping up nationalist sentiment.\nThe elections were not held in parts of the east because of the fighting which has raged in the area for the past three decades. Some seven million people have been forced from their homes - more than in any other country except Sudan.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that supporters of Felix Tshisekedi celebrated in Kinshasa on Thursday.  Source 1, from the BBC, a reputable news source, explicitly mentions that \"Mr Tshisekedi's supporters have taken to the streets to celebrate\" in Kinshasa.  The article further supports this by describing the election results and the subsequent reactions. The timeframe aligns with the caption. Therefore, the caption is strongly supported by the provided article.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Internal validation expresses uncertainty due to a lack of direct evidence linking the image to Felix Tshisekedi's supporters in Kinshasa.  The image depicts people celebrating in the streets at night, but this alone does not confirm their political affiliation or location.  The internal check's low confidence score (0) reflects this uncertainty.\n\nHowever, external validation provides strong evidence supporting the caption's claim.  A reputable news source (BBC) explicitly states that Tshisekedi's supporters celebrated in Kinshasa on the day specified in the caption.  This external evidence corroborates the caption's claim regarding the location, event, and the individuals involved (supporters of Tshisekedi). The high confidence score (8) from the external check reflects the strong supporting evidence from a reliable source.\n\nThe conflict between the internal and external checks stems from the image's lack of explicit identifiers, making internal verification difficult.  The image alone is insufficient to definitively confirm the caption; the external source is crucial in establishing the context.  Although the image shows a celebratory scene at night, without additional information within the image itself (e.g., banners, signs), internal validation cannot confidently confirm the caption's statement.\n\nThe final assessment weighs the external verification more heavily due to its strong supporting evidence from a reliable news source.  The external evidence provides the necessary context missing from the image itself.  Thus, while the image alone is inconclusive, the added context from the BBC article makes the caption highly likely to be accurate. This results in a final confidence score of 8, reflecting the strength of external evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation is uncertain due to the lack of explicit information in the image. External validation strongly supports the caption based on a reputable news source, resulting in a final assessment of high likelihood of accuracy despite the internal uncertainty."

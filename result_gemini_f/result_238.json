        "content": "Indonesian police have used tear gas and water cannon to subdue protesters as thousands of hard-line Muslims marched against Jakarta's governor.\nBasuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian, is the first ethnic Chinese to hold the governor's post in the capital of majority Muslim Indonesia.\nThe demonstrators accuse him of having insulted Islam's holy book, the Koran, and want him to be prosecuted.\nClashes broke out between police and protesters who refused to disperse.\nOne elderly man died, the Associated Press reports, citing police. Several other people, including police officers, have been injured.\nProtesters had earlier marched upon the presidential palace.\nPolice had been braced for the possibility of religious and racial tensions erupting at the rally, which an estimated 50,000 people attended.\nIt had mostly been peaceful but groups of angry demonstrators clashed with police after nightfall and set vehicles alight.\nIn 1998, a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment led to mobs looting and burning Chinese-owned shops and houses. Ethnic Chinese make up about 1% of Indonesia's population of 250 million people.\nThe protest was held to demand that Mr Purnama be prosecuted for blasphemy over comments he made in September that were seen as criticising a Koranic verse.\nHe said that Islamic groups using a passage of the Koran to urge people not to support him were deceiving voters, who will go to the polls in February.\nThe verse is interpreted by some as prohibiting Muslims from living under the leadership of a non-Muslim.\nMr Purnama has since apologised but formal complaints were lodged against him by Islamic groups for defamation. He is now being investigated by police.\nWho is Governor Ahok?\nSome protesters at Friday's rally carried signs calling for the governor's death, the BBC's Rebecca Henschke in Jakarta says.\nRepresentatives met with Vice-President Yusuf Kalla, who promised that the investigation into Mr Purnama would be completed within two weeks.",

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions clashes between demonstrators and police in Jakarta.  Source 1 describes clashes between police and protesters, mentioning injuries and even a death. However, there is no specific mention of demonstrators covering an elderly woman. The article focuses on the broader context of the protest and the violence that occurred.  While the overall context aligns, the specific detail about protecting an elderly woman is not directly supported or refuted.",

    "explanation": "Internal validation gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows protestors in what appears to be Jakarta, Indonesia, protecting an elderly woman during a demonstration. However, external validation provides a lower confidence score (4) because while it confirms clashes between police and protesters in Jakarta, it does not corroborate the specific detail of protestors shielding an elderly woman.  The external source focuses on the broader context of the protest and violence, without providing specific details about this particular scene.  The discrepancy arises from the level of detail. The internal check assesses the image content directly, while the external check relies on news reports that may not cover all aspects of the protest.  Therefore, while the general context (protests in Jakarta) is confirmed externally, the specific action depicted in the image (protecting an elderly woman) lacks explicit external support.  Given this discrepancy, a conservative confidence score of 6 reflects the uncertainty.  The overall context is likely accurate, but the specific detail about the elderly woman needs further verification.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation confirms the general context but does not explicitly support the specific detail of demonstrators protecting an elderly woman.  The discrepancy leads to a moderate confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is partially out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a member of the October 2018 Central American migrant caravan urinating on an U.S. flag.\nA caravan of asylum seekers heading toward the United States border from Guatemala in the fall of 2018 was seized on as a campaign issue by many politicians heading into the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. As with most hot-button political issues, internet trolls quickly spread hoaxes and unfounded rumors maligning the caravan group.\nOn 2 November 2018, a social media user shared a photograph to the \"Bill O'Reilly Fans\" Facebook group that supposedly depicted a scene in which \"migrants in the Guatemalan Caravan stand on, and then urinate on, U.S. flag before throwing it in the trash can\":\nBut the image depicted none of those claimed aspects: It was several years old (not recent), was taken in the United States (not along the caravan), and didn't capture anyone urinating on a flag.\nThis photograph was snapped in April 2016 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee before a campaign appearance there by then-candidate Donald Trump, and it shows a protester standing (not urinating) on a U.S. flag.\nA news account from Milwaukee television station WITI stated that the protester \"stomped\" on the flag but did not report that anyone urinated on the flag:\nThere were protesters outside the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Mainstage Theatre, where Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was set to host a Fox News Channel town hall event scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on campus. Fox News Anchor Greta Van Susteren moderated the event.\nA FOX6 News crew estimated there to be about 70 to 100 protesters on hand outside the theatre. Most were a part of the group #WeLove, which was started on Facebook.\nAn exchange occurred after a protester was seen stomping on an American flag outside the theatre ...\nSome weren't happy to see protesters disrespecting the American flag. FOX6 News is told the man who pulled out the American flag and stood on it was not affiliated with the #WeLove group.\n\"That`s our flag. That`s our country. I mean, that's -- we've got family members, they've got family members that died for their right to do that and there is just no gratefulness, no respect. There's no appreciation and it makes me sick. It thoroughly makes me sick. I think it's sad,\" James Turk said.\nMedia Milwaukee, the university's student newspaper, provided some additional context about the protest:\nVaun Mays stood silently among the more vocal protesters, distanced from the crowd, with his feet firmly planted on top of an American flag laying across the cement. Mays wasnt yelling, he wasnt shouting, he stood -- silently. He had a message to share for those who were interested in hearing it, justifying his controversial treatment of the American flag.\nIt is unknown if Mays was directly affiliated with the rest of the protests or if he was acting on his own accord.\nIm here [against] Trump, and Im also here to call at hypocrisy and racism of America, said Mays. Part of this [Trumps] message is to Make America Great Again. What America is he talking about? We all know the past of America. I always get resistance for this; people take it personally. Its not aimed at any person or group of people, not against vets or white people in particular; its my own personal message.\nThe original photograph can be seen here, and a video report on the protest from WITI can be viewed below:",

      "explanation": "The provided text focuses on a claim about flag desecration, not littering.  The article from Snopes debunks a claim related to the migrant caravan and a US flag, but it does not address the issue of trash being left behind.

    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "Internal validation shows high confidence (10) that the image depicts trash, aligning with the caption's description. However, external validation reveals low confidence (3) and irrelevance to the claim. The Snopes article cited focuses on flag desecration, not the littering depicted in the image.  The discrepancy arises from the external check's failure to provide evidence related to the image's content (trash left by migrants).  Therefore, while the image internally supports the caption, the lack of external corroboration significantly reduces overall confidence. The final assessment leans towards 'out of context' due to the absence of external evidence supporting the caption's claim about the origin of the trash.  There is a significant conflict between internal and external checks, with internal validation strongly supporting the caption, while external validation is not relevant to the specific claim. Given this conflict, a conservative judgment is made, acknowledging the uncertainty and resulting in a low confidence score. Further investigation into whether the migrants left the trash is needed.  The focus of the internal validation was solely on the presence of trash, while the external validation tried to verify the claim that the specific migrants mentioned in the caption were responsible for the trash.  This mismatch in focus caused the discrepancy.  Without external evidence verifying the connection between the migrants and the trash, the caption's claim remains unsubstantiated.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's description of trash. However, external validation is irrelevant, failing to provide evidence linking the trash to the migrant caravan. This conflict and lack of external support result in a low confidence score and an 'out of context' assessment."

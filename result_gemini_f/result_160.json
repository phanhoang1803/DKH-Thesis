      "explanation": "The provided article is in a different language and does not discuss zebras crossing a road in Kenya.  Therefore, there is no information to support or contradict the claim in the news caption. The source is from BBC, a reputable news organization, which slightly increases confidence, but the irrelevance of the article makes a definitive judgment impossible.",

    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check reveals a significant discrepancy between the caption and the image. The caption describes zebras crossing a road while a motorcyclist waits, a scene absent from the provided image.  The image depicts zebras at night, illuminated by a light source that could be a vehicle's headlight, but no motorcyclist is present. This internal inconsistency lowers confidence in the caption's accuracy. The external check did not find supporting evidence from the provided article, which is in a different language and unrelated to the topic. The absence of corroborating external evidence further reduces confidence in the caption's accuracy.  Therefore, based on both the lack of visual alignment (internal check) and the absence of supporting evidence from external sources, we conclude the caption is out of context. The confidence score reflects the combined assessment of both internal and external checks, with the lack of supporting evidence and visual mismatch outweighing the limited confidence offered by the reputable source of the external article, which simply did not address the caption's claims. Overall, the caption does not align with the provided image nor find supporting evidence in the external information. The claim about a motorcyclist waiting is entirely unsubstantiated, and the location in Kimana Sanctuary is unsubstantiated. While the image shows zebras, it does not depict the scene described in the original caption.  Therefore, the assertion that the caption accurately represents the image is rejected.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal and external checks both indicate the caption is out of context. Internal inconsistencies highlight the absence of a motorcyclist and the external check fails to find supporting information. Combined confidence is low."

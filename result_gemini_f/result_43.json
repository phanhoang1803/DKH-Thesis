    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. However, the external check reveals a complete lack of supporting evidence.  The provided source articles are irrelevant to the claim in the caption, resulting in a low confidence score (0). The conflict between the high internal confidence and the complete absence of external corroboration indicates a potential issue with the caption's validity. There's no way to verify if the woman in the image is Harriet McAtee, if she's a yoga teacher, or whether this event specifically took place in Oxford.  The image alone supports the caption's description of a yoga practice on a narrowboat, but it cannot confirm the other details. The lack of external validation significantly weakens the claim, leading to the conclusion that the caption might be out of context. The final confidence score is low (2) due to the significant discrepancy and the absence of supporting evidence outside the image itself. Without additional information, any judgment on the accuracy of the caption remains uncertain.  To improve the confidence score, additional reliable sources, such as news articles, social media posts from Harriet McAtee (if that is her name), or similar confirming details, are needed. ",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on image content; however, the external check fails to find any supporting evidence. The significant conflict and lack of external verification lead to a low confidence in the caption's accuracy and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

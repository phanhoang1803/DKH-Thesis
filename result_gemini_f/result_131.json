        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows salt spilled from a fallen shaker that created the image of Jesus on a table.\nA meme popular on social media posits that a photograph depicts a praying diner who was belittled by atheists for his faith until a salt shaker on his table fell and the spilled crystals miraculously formed an image of Jesus:\nThe narrative attached to this picture is a ridiculous and fabricated one, a spoof of the type of inspirational stories known as \"glurge (in particular, the subset of glurge tales involving tests of faith.) The photograph seen here is real, however -- but its explanation is an artistic rather than a miraculous one.\nThe person pictured here is artist Rob Ferrel of San Antonio, Texas, who uses a variety of media to create his artworks, including salt and other food products, as reported on Oddity Central:\nA true artist doesnt really need expensive tools and materials to produce something beautiful, and San Antonio artist Rob Ferrel is the perfect example. For months, he has been treating his Instagram followers with highly realist portraits that he creates using nothing but salt, a few brushes, and a piece of cardstock.\nFerrel begins by pouring salt on a table and then moves it around with brushes until recognizable features begin to emerge. He also uses cardstock for clean, sharp lines. Once the portrait is ready, he photographs it and posts it to Instagram, and then gathers up all the salt to make his next masterpiece.\nHis posts regularly get thousands of likes, but some of the more popular portraits are of Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, John Lennon, Lebron James, the cast of Fast & Furious, and The Notorious B.I.G, which he made on a wooden floor.\nBut its not just salt Ferrel works with. The young artist is so talented that he can produce breathtaking art out of pretty much anything. He runs a salon in San Antonio called Rob the Original Barbershop, where he gives customers crazy haircuts sculpted with logos, patterns, and celeb portraits.\nFerrel demonstrated his \"salt art\" during a television appearance on KRPC's Houston Life with hosts Derrick Shore and Courtney Zavala:",

      "explanation": "The news caption is explicitly confirmed by the article from Snopes.

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check finds a high degree of visual consistency between the caption's description and the image content.  The image depicts a figure resembling Jesus, seemingly formed by a substance that looks like salt, spread on a dark background. This directly aligns with the caption's description of \"salt spilled from a fallen shaker that created the image of Jesus on a table.\" The external check corroborates this finding by referencing a Snopes article, a reputable source for fact-checking, which confirms the existence of a photograph depicting a similar image created by salt. The Snopes article explicitly mentions that the creation of the image, while artistic, involved salt spilled to produce the visual result consistent with the caption. There are no discrepancies between internal and external validation. The high confidence scores (10 for both checks) reinforce this agreement. Both focus on the visual representation of salt forming the image of Jesus, which is perfectly represented in the caption. There is no uncertainty, and no conflicts are present between internal and external analysis. The entity analysis (the image itself) aligns perfectly with the caption and the external source's description. The collective evidence decisively supports the conclusion that the caption is not out of context and accurately reflects the image content. Given the high consistency and confirmation from a reliable external source, the confidence score is 10.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly agree that the caption accurately describes the image content.  The image depicts a Jesus-like figure created by salt, precisely as the caption states.  A Snopes article further validates this description."

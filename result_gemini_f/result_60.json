    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's accuracy. The internal check highlights the alignment between the image (sheep in a bus shelter) and the caption's description. The external check adds context by noting the plausibility of a sheep being in a bus shelter in a rural area like North Harris, Scotland, known for sheep farming. While neither check provides absolute proof, the combined evidence strongly suggests the caption is accurate. The confidence score reflects this strong support, but it's not a definitive 10 due to the lack of direct evidence like a news article or geotagged photo confirming the exact event.  The location detail, \"Huisinish point on North Harris,\" adds specificity and strengthens the credibility of the caption.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external assessments.  Both checks acknowledge the inherent limitations of verifying such a claim based solely on an image and a caption, emphasizing the reasonable, yet not irrefutable, nature of the evidence. Overall, the assessment weighs the plausibility of the scenario against the lack of definitive proof, resulting in a high confidence score but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with high confidence scores.  The plausibility of the event and the specificity of the location details strengthen the overall assessment.  However, a lack of direct, corroborating evidence limits confidence to a score of 8/10."

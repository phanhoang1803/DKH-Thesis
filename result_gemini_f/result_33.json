  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's accuracy. The internal check found the image consistent with the caption, noting the presence of Mike Pompeo in what appears to be a mosque. The external check corroborated this by referencing Mike Pompeo's time as Secretary of State, his frequent international travels, and the existence of Egypt's new administrative capital. Although the external check couldn't independently verify this specific visit without access to Pompeo's itinerary or news reports, the plausibility of such a visit aligns with his role and Egypt's geopolitical significance.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8, respectively) contribute to a high overall confidence score. There are no significant discrepancies or conflicts between the internal and external validation results. The assessment is based solely on the available evidence, maintaining a conservative judgment in the absence of definitive proof of this precise event. The slight deduction from a perfect score reflects the lack of direct, definitive external verification, such as a news article or official record of this specific mosque visit.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with high confidence scores.  The lack of definitive external verification for the precise visit is the only limiting factor."

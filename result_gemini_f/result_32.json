      "explanation": "Based on general knowledge about the socio-economic disparities within New York City, and the existence of high-mortality areas within large urban environments, the statement is plausible.  However, without specific data on mortality rates for individual ZIP codes in Brooklyn, it's impossible to definitively confirm the claim. The statement requires verification from reliable sources such as the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or the CDC.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption to be out of context because the image depicts a tire shop, and there is no information about death rates or ZIP codes. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the statement due to known socio-economic disparities and the availability of NYC public health data. However, it also emphasizes that without specific data, the claim cannot be definitively confirmed.  The discrepancy arises from the image's lack of relevant information, contrasting with the external check's consideration of broader societal contexts. Because the image provides no evidence related to the caption's claim, and external verification relies on unconfirmed general knowledge, the confidence score is low. The caption is out of context as the image shows a tire shop with no connection to mortality rates or a specific Brooklyn ZIP code.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the caption out of context due to the image's lack of relevant information. External check finds the claim plausible based on general knowledge but requires specific data for confirmation.  Discrepancy exists between image content and claim; low confidence due to lack of image-based evidence."

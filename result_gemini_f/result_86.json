    "explanation": "Internal validation shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image depicts a double rainbow over a bridge in Glasgow, aligning with the caption's description. However, external validation reveals low confidence (score 3) due to the lack of corroborating evidence from news articles or online sources.  No relevant news articles or social media posts were found to confirm the occurrence of this specific double rainbow event over Glasgow's squinty bridge. The discrepancy between the high internal confidence and low external confidence suggests a potential issue with the caption's claim. While the image itself strongly supports the caption's description of a double rainbow and its location, the absence of external verification weakens the overall confidence. This lack of external verification could be due to several reasons, including the event's relative obscurity, limited online reporting on such localized weather phenomena, or the time elapsed since the event occurred. Given the limited external evidence, it's cautious to conclude that the caption's claim is likely out of context because the absence of supporting information is a significant issue. This assessment leans towards caution due to insufficient external validation and acknowledges the uncertainty inherent in verifying a specific, potentially localized weather event without further supporting evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's claim based on image analysis, while external validation fails to find any supporting evidence. The conflict between high internal and low external confidence scores leads to a cautious conclusion that the caption may be out of context due to the lack of external verification."

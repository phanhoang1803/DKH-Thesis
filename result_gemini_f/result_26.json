        "content": "Claim:\nNASA warned that Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) could hit Earth in April 2020 and cause catastrophic danger.\nOn April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earths surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earths surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earths surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earths surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earths atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earths surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes fact-checks a claim that NASA warned about an asteroid hitting Earth in April 2020 and causing catastrophic damage.  While the claim in the caption is factually true in that an asteroid, 1998 OR2, did have a close approach to Earth in April 2020,  the Snopes article clarifies that NASA did *not* warn of an impending catastrophic impact.  News outlets sensationalized the event.  The Snopes article details the actual distance of the asteroid's pass and points out that a catastrophic impact was extremely improbable. Therefore, while the underlying event (the asteroid's close approach) was true, the caption's assertion of a NASA warning and impending catastrophe is misleading. ",

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the visual alignment of the image with the caption, finding a partial match due to the presence of an asteroid and the mention of NASA. However, it lacks the specificity to verify the asteroid's name or the claim of a potential Earth impact. The external check, on the other hand, provides strong evidence against the caption's claim. It references a Snopes fact-check that confirms the asteroid's close approach but refutes the claim of a NASA warning about a catastrophic impact.  The Snopes article highlights the sensationalization of the event by news outlets and clarifies the safe distance at which the asteroid passed Earth. This discrepancy arises because the internal check primarily focuses on image content alignment, while the external check validates the accuracy of the claim made in the caption.  The high confidence score of 8 reflects the strong evidence from the external check refuting the core claim of the caption. While the image shows an asteroid, the caption's claim regarding a NASA warning and impending catastrophe is demonstrably false according to the Snopes fact-check. The conflict is resolved by prioritizing the reliable external evidence, which reveals that the caption is misleading, hence 'OOC' is set to true.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds partial visual match but lacks specificity. External check strongly refutes the caption's claim of a NASA warning and catastrophic impact, citing a Snopes fact-check.  External evidence overrides the partial internal match, concluding that the caption is out of context."

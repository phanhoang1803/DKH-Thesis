A person, presumably the artist Nino Sarabutra, walks in the background, and the location appears to be consistent with a temple in Bangkok.  The caption's claim of porcelain skulls seems plausible given the appearance of the objects.  However, I cannot definitively confirm the artist's name or the precise temple name without additional information.",

      "confidence_score": 7,
      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Thai artists often create thought-provoking installations, and the use of porcelain skulls in an art piece exploring mortality aligns with artistic themes.  Wat Prayurawongsawas is a real temple in Bangkok, making the location believable. However, without specific evidence of this particular installation (e.g., news articles, images, artist's website), it's impossible to definitively confirm its existence. The name Nino Sarabutra is not easily verifiable as a known artist, adding to the uncertainty. ",
      "supporting_points": "- Thai art often incorporates religious and philosophical themes.\n- Porcelain is a common material in art.\n- Skulls are often used as artistic symbols of mortality and the transient nature of life.\n- Wat Prayurawongsawas temple exists in Bangkok.\n- The title \"What Will We Leave Behind\" is consistent with themes explored in art installations.",

    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The caption's claim is plausible based on both internal and external validation.  The image shows an art installation consistent with the description.  The internal check highlights the plausible nature of porcelain skulls and the Bangkok temple setting, but acknowledges limitations in definitively confirming the artist's name or temple name.  Similarly, the external check notes the plausibility of a Thai artist creating such an installation, considering common themes in Thai art and the existence of the mentioned temple in Bangkok. However, it also notes the lack of readily available evidence confirming the specific art installation's existence and the artist's identity. Both checks express a degree of uncertainty due to insufficient verifiable information.  While the overall context aligns with the caption's description, the lack of definitive proof for the artist's name, specific temple location tied to the artwork, and the title prevent achieving a higher confidence score.  The evidence is suggestive but not conclusive enough for a higher certainty. There are no major discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both agree on the plausibility of the claim but highlight uncertainty due to a lack of definitive proof.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible but lack definitive evidence.  The plausibility stems from the image's content and the overall plausibility of a Thai artist creating such a work in Bangkok.  However, the lack of independent verification of the artist's name, specific artwork title, and precise location within the temple limits confidence."

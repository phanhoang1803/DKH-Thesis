        "date": "2018-12-18T10:14:11",
        "content": "From the far-right to the left, opposition parties across Hungarys political spectrum have been showing unity against what they consider the increasingly authoritarian rule of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his ruling Fidesz Party.\nThousands of Hungarians have marched through Budapest  some chanting Vik-ta-tor (an amalgamation of Viktor and dictator) and waving pro-democracy placards  since the government passed several laws on Wednesday that critics say will tighten Orbans grip on power.\nOne of the new laws will allow employers to demand up to 400 hours of overtime annually; critics have dubbed it the slave law. Another will create a new government-controlled court system.\nBut what began last week as a rally against the overtime law has expanded into several days of demonstrations against Orbans government.\nOn Monday evening, thousands protested outside the headquarters of Hungarys state-run broadcaster MTVA, chanting anti-government slogans and shouting weve had enough.\nIt was the sixth night of protests against the government, condemned as Filthy Fidesz by the protesters. Pictures from the scene showed people bringing the demonstrators hot tea, food and even warm socks.\nAround a dozen opposition members of parliament entered the building earlier on Monday and asked to be given airtime. Four lawmakers said the standoff led to them being manhandled by the broadcasters security guards.\nI protest because our parents left a free and democratic country (for) us in 1990 and now we are at their age and we (are learning) again how to fear, a former English teacher, who asked not to be named because her current employer relies on government funding, told CNN on Monday.\nI protest because they stole our past, (our) present and the future of our children. And I protest because my beloved country lost its freedom.\nExperts have said these protests are different from previous unrest in the country in 2014 and 2016.\nIt is the first time opposition parties, inside and outside parliament, are cooperating and working together to prevent these laws from taking effect, Bulcsu Hunyadi, senior analyst at Budapest think tank Political Capital, told CNN.\nSlave law and parallel courts\nCampaigners say the labor law doesnt have much support among Hungarians, and that the government is doing little to heed their concerns.\nThe so-called slave law amendment is hugely unpopular, polls have shown that 80% of Hungarians are against it. So not only is it unpopular, but the way it was pushed through parliament was also very upsetting, Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, told CNN.\nThe law will increase the number of overtime hours companies can demand from workers in a year from 250 to 400 hours. It allows employers to delay overtime payments for up to three years.\nThe government told CNN that the voluntary changes to working hours were in the interest of the workers and would allow people to work and earn more.\nThe changes come as the country faces a labor shortage, exacerbated by a shrinking population and declining birth rate.\nThe other controversial law will create new courts, overseen by Orbans justice minister, to handle cases concerning government business, such as taxes and elections.\nRights groups said it undermines the separation of powers between the executive and judicial powers, paving the way for government political interference.\nIt is the final nail on the coffin of executive control of the judiciary, Pardavi said.\nThe government told CNN that the new courts, which are set to begin operating next year, will be independent and in line with current European approaches and standards.\nGrowing numbers\nOn Sunday, demonstrations in Budapest swelled to an estimated 11,000 people as largely peaceful protesters in sub-zero temperatures marched to parliament. There were also smaller protests in at least seven other cities, police told CNN.\nIn the past few years, protests usually concentrated in Budapest, Pardavi said.\n[On Sunday] there were protests in several towns in Hungary. The profile of protesters is very mixed, one can see flags of [the far-right party] Jobbik and the flags of the leftist opposition parties being waved.\nPolice confirmed there were protests outside Budapest in seven cities on Sunday, including Debrecen, Gyor, Szeged, Bekescsaba and Miskolc.\nAfter the rally at parliament ended on Sunday, a pocket of several thousand protesters marched to the headquarters of MTVA. Some attempted to storm the building. Video and images show officers in riot gear firing tear gas into the crowd during the confrontation.\nLive-streamed video posted by CNN affiliate ATV Hungary showed reporters trapped in a crowd of protesters unable to move, as well as people crouched on the ground temporarily blinded by the tear gas.\nThe protesters  who are made up of disparate groups of opposition parties, trade unions and students  have made five demands to the government: for the labor law to be abolished, a decrease of the police forces work hours, an independent judiciary, for Hungary join the European Public Prosecutors Office, and an independent public media.\nOn Monday, opposition lawmakers entered MTVA headquarters to read the five demands on television. State media is making no mention of their presence or demands. But there is news on migrants, tweeted journalist Benjamin Novak.\nThe broadcaster refused to give the MPs airtime and some of the lawmakers were forcibly removed from the building.\nOpposition MPs Bernadett Szel and kos Hadhzy were filmed being removed from MTVA headquarters by security guards.\nAnother lawmaker, Lszl Varj, from center-left party the Democratic Coalition, was seen being driven away in an ambulance. He told local radio station Club that he was covered in bruises from a scuffle with the broadcasters security guards.\nMP gnes Vadai, who was outside the building, said she was also manhandled by the guards.\nWe are here to try to recapture  democracy, Pter Jakab, a spokesman for the Jobbik party, told CNN from inside MTVA on Monday. At the moment armed guards are protecting an institution producing fake news  what will happen? We do not know. Life is the biggest director.\nIn a statement to CNN, the broadcaster did not address all the MPs allegations, but instead accused them of scaring MTVAs employees. The opposition politicians tried to blackmail MTVA by saying that if their demand [was] not be met, thousands of angry people might come in from the street.\nHadhzy tried to get into the operational area by sneaking over a handrail. Security personnel warned and called upon him and, as he did not desist, he was removed from the building together with Szl who was hanging on to him, the statement added.\nThe standoff ended when around a dozen members of parliament left the headquarters on Monday evening.\nGovernment blames opposition, Soros for protests\nThe opposition is calling on people to commit acts of violence against police, the Prime Ministers office said on Monday of the protests.\nIt also said the organizers included a great number of George Soross subsidized people.\nThe Hungarian-American philanthropist and billionaire is Orbans foe, and a frequent punching bag for the Hungarian government and media outlets controlled by Orban allies, experts said.\nThe protests come on the heels of Hungarys Stop Soros law, which banned non-governmental organizations from assisting undocumented migrants.\nEarlier this month, Central European University, which was founded by Soros, said it had been forced out of Hungary in an arbitrary eviction. The US State Department said it was disappointed by the move and described it as a loss for Hungary.\nThose who criticize the governments policies or speak up against corruption or human rights violations will be stigmatized as traitors or Soros-agents, and face the risk of political, legal, administrative or financial measures to limit their scope of actions, analyst Bulcsu Hunyadi said.\nSince Orbans populist Fidesz Party swept into power in 2010, and most recently won a landslide victory in April this year in the face of an uncoordinated opposition, it has come under increasing fire from the European Union over its crackdowns on democratic institutions.\nEarlier this year, the European Parliament took the unprecedented decision to trigger Article 7  a disciplinary process  against Hungary over its erosion of democratic norms that spanned everything from the media to migrants.",

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions protests in Hungary against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's policies, including a controversial labor law dubbed the \"slave law.\"  Source 1, from CNN, details widespread protests in December against Orban's government and its policies, including the labor law. While the source doesn't explicitly state that police *kept watch* over a protest in December, it describes large-scale demonstrations and police presence during some protests, particularly those outside the MTVA headquarters. The phrasing in the caption is somewhat vague, and the article doesn't provide the exact level of police presence or specify every protest.

    "explanation": "The internal check and external check both support the caption's assertion that the image depicts a protest related to Viktor Orbán's policies and the presence of police. The internal check highlights the visual elements aligning with the caption: a projection of Orbán, a protest setting suggested by the police presence, and an implicit time frame.  The external check corroborates this by referencing news reports of widespread protests in Hungary in December against Orbán's government and its policies, particularly a labor law. While the external source doesn't explicitly state that police \"kept watch\" in this specific instance, it describes substantial police presence during similar December protests.  The difference in confidence scores (8 for internal and 7 for external) is minor and doesn't suggest a significant discrepancy. Both assessments concur that the core narrative of a protest against Orbán's policies involving police monitoring is likely accurate. Therefore, the caption aligns with the available evidence. The minor discrepancy is attributed to the caption's somewhat general phrasing (\"kept watch\"), which is not directly confirmed by the external source but is implied by the general context and the presence of many police officers in the picture. Although the exact date of the protest pictured is uncertain, the general context and timing of December protests in Hungary related to Orbán's policies provide strong circumstantial evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's claim, with minor differences in confidence levels primarily due to the caption's less specific wording compared to the details in the external source. The overall agreement points towards the accuracy of the caption."

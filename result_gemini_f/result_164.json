        "content": "Police in the Democratic Republic of Congo have clashed with opposition supporters demanding that last week's presidential poll be annulled.\nLeading opposition candidates have denounced the election as a sham and have demanded a rerun.\nSeveral people were wounded as police fired tear gas and threw stones back at protesters in the capital, Kinshasa.\nThe government banned the protest, saying it would not tolerate attempts to undermine the electoral process.\nElection officials have so far not said exactly how many polling stations opened or how many people voted in the 20 December election.\nAbout 44 million people were registered to vote at about 75,000 polling stations.\nWith just over nine million ballots counted so far, President Felix Tshisekedi is in the lead with almost 80% of the vote as he seeks a second term.\nFootball tycoon and mining magnate Mose Katumbi is trailing him with about 16%.\nFormer oil executive Martin Fayulu, who claims he was robbed of victory in the 2018 election, is in third place with about 4%.\nMr Fayulu's supporters burnt tyres and clashed with police outside his campaign headquarters in Kinshasa.\nPolice took up positions on key roads in the city and thwarted an attempted march to the headquarters of the electoral commission.\nMr Fayulu said that 11 of his supporters were injured, while police reported two injuries on their side.\nThe election was marred by logistical delays and administrative chaos, forcing voting to be extended to a second day in some parts of the country.\nThe opposition has also accused the electoral commission of orchestrating fraud and ballot stuffing in order to pave the way for Mr Tshisekedi to be declared the winner.\nThe commission has denied the allegations.\nDR Congo is roughly four times the size of France, but lacks basic infrastructure. Even some of its main cities are not linked by road.\nAbout two-thirds of the country's 100 million population live below the poverty line, earning $2.15 (1.70) a day or less.\nVoters also chose parliamentary, provincial and municipal representatives, with about 100,000 candidates in total.\nThe elections were not held in parts of the east because of insecurity.\nDozens of armed groups have been competing to control parts of the region, home to much of the country's vast mineral wealth.\nThis includes vast reserves of cobalt, a vital part of many lithium batteries, seen as essential to a future free of fossil fuels.\nYou may also be interested in:\nFlix Tshisekedi: The man who vowed to make Congo the 'Germany of Africa'\nMose Katumbi: Millionaire mining magnate runs for DR Congo president\nMartin Fayulu: The Congolese candidate who refuses to give up",

The article states that \"With just over nine million ballots counted so far...\", clearly indicating that ballot counting took place in Kinshasa during the time frame implied by the caption.

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check achieves a high confidence score (10) due to the visual alignment between the image content (people counting what appear to be ballots) and the caption's description. The external check also demonstrates a high confidence score (8), corroborating the caption with a BBC news article that explicitly reports ballot counting in Kinshasa during the DR Congo elections.  The article's mention of the ongoing vote count in Kinshasa directly supports the caption's claim. There is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks; both consistently point towards the caption being accurate and not out of context. The high confidence scores from both checks strengthen the overall assessment. The image depicts an activity (ballot counting) and a location (Kinshasa) that are independently verified by the external source. While there's always a small degree of uncertainty inherent in image interpretation and news reporting, the combined evidence from visual analysis and external news strongly indicates the caption's reliability. The external validation provides concrete evidence placing the image in the context of the DR Congo elections held in Kinshasa, validating the image's setting and the activity described in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy. The image content aligns with the caption's description, and an external news source corroborates the reported location and activity.  High confidence scores from both checks indicate the caption is not out of context."

        "content": "Six people were killed and 16 others injured Wednesday when a passenger train apparently hit falling cargo from a passing freight train as it crossed a bridge in Denmark.\nThe rail operator, Danish Railways, earlier told TV2 that the victims were passengers on a train traveling from Odense to Copenhagen.\nPolice spokesman Lars Braemhoej said that while \"we do not know precisely what caused the accident,\" one possible cause was that cargo from a passing freight train fell off and hit the passenger train. He added there was \"considerable damage\" to the passenger train.\nPolice declined to comment on a report from Denmark's TV2 channel that a container had likely fallen off the cargo train.\nDanish media initially reported that a tarpaulin on a freight train hit the passenger train, which was going in the opposite direction, prompting it to brake violently.\n\"Ordinary Danes on their way to work or heading home from the Christmas holidays have had their lives smashed,\" said Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen.\nPhotos from the scene show the freight train was carrying crates of beer, and the tarpaulin that covered the train was torn in pieces.\nKasper Elbjoern, spokesman for Danish brewery group Carlsberg, confirmed that a freight train transporting its cargo was involved in the accident.\nPolice said those hurt sustained light to moderate injuries.\nJesper Nielsen, who was on the passenger train, told Denmark's TV2 the train \"was out on the bridge when there was a huge 'bang' .... very quickly thereafter, the train braked.\"\nThe accident took place on a road-and-rail bridge, part of the Storebaelt system of bridges and a tunnel linking the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check highlights the visual alignment of the image with the caption's description: a train accident scene on a bridge, with rescue workers present.  The geographical references (Great Belt Bridge and Nyborg, Denmark) are consistent with the visual context. The high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong internal consistency.\n\nThe external check further strengthens this assessment.  It verifies the caption's accuracy by cross-referencing it with a news article detailing a train accident on a bridge in Denmark.  The article specifically mentions the involvement of rescue workers and locates the accident within the Storebaelt system, which encompasses the Great Belt Bridge. This corroboration is further bolstered by the article's detailed account of casualties and rescue efforts, all aligning seamlessly with the image's implied context.  The external check also achieves a high confidence score of 10, underscoring the strong evidence supporting the caption's accuracy. \n\nThere are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both independently and collectively point to the caption being an accurate representation of the image's content and the reported event. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) reinforce this conclusion. Therefore, the final assessment confidently confirms that the caption is not out of context.",

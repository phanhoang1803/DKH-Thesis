        "content": "Four aid workers were killed last month during fighting in Ethiopia's Tigray region, aid agencies say.\nThe Danish Refugee Council (DRC) reported the deaths of three security guards, while the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said one of its staff members had been killed.\nGovernment forces have been battling the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in the region since 4 November.\nThe government says it is in control of Tigray and the conflict is over.\nBut TPLF leaders say they are still fighting on various fronts.\nMeanwhile, the United States has accused Eritrean forces of entering Tigray, something both Ethiopia and Eritrea deny.\nHundreds, even thousands, of people are thought to have been killed in the conflict, while about 50,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan.\nWhat do we know about the deaths?\nA lot of information about the killings is still unclear. The area is still under a communications blackout so it is difficult to verify information.\nThe DRC said it was \"deeply saddened\" over the deaths of three of its guards.\n\"Sadly, due to the lack of communications and ongoing insecurity in the region, it has not yet been possible to reach their families,\" it said.\nThe IRC said its member of staff had been killed in Hitsats Refugee Camp in Shire on 19 November, two days before government troops took control of the town.\n\"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our colleague; our in-country staff are the very heart of our work and are key in our ability to provide support and assistance to our clients,\" the IRC said in a statement, adding that efforts to gather information continued.\nWhat's the latest in Ethiopia?\nEthiopian troops captured Tigray's capital, Mekelle, from the TPLF on 28 November, but fighting has reportedly continued in parts of the region.\nThe Ethiopian government on Friday denied the conflict was preventing aid reaching civilians.\nAid agencies say blocked access, delays and violence against staff are preventing aid deliveries to the region.\nIn response, a statement from the office of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said: \"Suggestions that humanitarian assistance is impeded due to active military combat... within the Tigray region [are] untrue.\"\nSuch statements undermine efforts to stabilise the region, it added.\nMr Abiy said last week that federal troops had not killed a single civilian in their offensive on Tigray.\nCivilians fleeing fighting in Tigray last month told Reuters news agency that they had seen bombing by government warplanes, shooting on the streets, and people being attacked with machetes.\nWhat is the US saying about Eritrea?\nThe US has called for the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Tigray. The US believes the Eritrean military - which has found common cause with Mr Abiy over the TPLF - entered the region after it came under rocket fire.\n\"We are aware of credible reports of Eritrean military involvement in Tigray and view this as a grave development,\" a State Department spokesperson said.\n\"We urge that any such troops be withdrawn immediately.\"\nBoth Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied that Eritrean troops have been involved in fighting.\nNearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees have been living camps in Tigray. They fled political persecution and compulsory military service, long before the current conflict.\nEthiopia's government said on Friday it was returning a large number of \"misinformed\" Eritrean refugees to Tigray after they had fled to the capital Addis Ababa - a moved which has alarmed the UN.\nWhat is the conflict about?\nThe conflict started on 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.",

      "explanation": "The BBC news article directly supports the main claims in the caption.  The article states that hundreds, even thousands, of people are thought to have been killed in the conflict, and that about 50,000 have fled to neighboring Sudan.  This aligns with the caption's assertion of hundreds killed and approximately 50,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan. The article also mentions fighting between Ethiopian government forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which is consistent with the caption's description of the conflict.  The source is a reputable news organization, adding to the confidence in the verdict.",

    "explanation": "The internal check expresses uncertainty due to the lack of explicit information within the image confirming the individuals' refugee status or their involvement in the Tigray conflict. The image shows a woman holding a child; this aligns with the caption's narrative of refugees in need. However, visual evidence alone cannot verify the context of the caption definitively. The external check, on the other hand, provides strong support for the caption's claims using a reputable news source (BBC News). This source corroborates the details mentioned in the caption, including the scale of the conflict, the number of casualties and refugees, and the conflict's participants (Ethiopian government forces and TPLF).  The discrepancy stems from the nature of the evidence; the image provides limited verifiable information, while the external source offers concrete data.  The high confidence score of the external check outweighs the low confidence of the internal check. Because the external source is a reliable news organization, it provides sufficient evidence to support the caption's claims, despite the image's limitations. Therefore, the caption is deemed not to be out of context, with a confidence score adjusted to reflect the uncertainty of the visual evidence while prioritizing the strong external corroboration. The final score considers the weight given to the external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows low confidence due to lack of explicit visual confirmation of context. External check shows high confidence due to corroboration by a reputable news source. The external validation outweighs the internal uncertainty.  Caption is not out of context."

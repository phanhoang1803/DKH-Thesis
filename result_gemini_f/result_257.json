The attendance numbers were disappointing for the Trump campaign, to say the least, as they had boasted in the days leading up to the event that they had received more than a million RSVPs for the event.\nAs Trump's defenders attempted to explain away the rally's poor attendance, some social media users attempted to flat out deny that the event was poorly attended by claiming that the media was lying about attendance figures, and by circulating photographs that they claimed showed how the arena was actually packed during the event.\nBelow is one such posting:\nThis appears to be a genuine photograph from a Trump rally  but it wasn't taken at the Tulsa rally in June 2020. This image appears to have been taken at a November 2019 Trump rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.\nThe BOK Center has the capacity for 19,000 people. According to the Tulsa Fire Department, the arena was less than half full during Trump's rally, with an attendance of 6,200 people.\nWhile the above-displayed post claims that the viral images of empty seats at Trump's Tulsa rally were taken before the event started, there are plenty of images showing these empty seats while Trump was on stage:\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump reelection campaign, disputed the fire department's count, arguing that there were closer to 12,000 people at the rally. Regardless, the above-displayed image was not taken at the BOK Center in Tulsa in June 2020.\nThe image in the viral Facebook post appears to show the scene at President Trump's rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida in November 2019. While it's difficult to read, the words \"Florida Welcomes\" seem to be written at the top of the jumbotron. Photographs and videos from this rally appear to show the same blue banner wrapped around the arena, the same division and color of seats, the same jumbotron, and the same setup for the stage as seen in the viral image.",

It states that a photograph showing a packed arena for President Trump's June 2020 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma is miscaptioned. The image was actually taken at a different rally in Florida.  The article cites the Tulsa Fire Department's official attendance figures of around 6,200, which contradicts the caption's description of a \"packed arena\". The Snopes article provides sufficient evidence to conclude the caption is false.",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The image shows President Trump speaking at what appears to be a large, crowded rally.  The signage clearly indicates a \"Make America Great Again\" rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The visual information strongly supports the caption. However, the external check also provides a high confidence score (10), but with a contradictory verdict (False).  This external validation relies on the Snopes.com fact-check which provides strong evidence that the image is miscaptioned. Snopes cites the Tulsa Fire Department's official attendance figures of approximately 6,200 people, significantly less than a packed arena. The Snopes article states that the photograph was actually taken at a different rally in Florida, not the Tulsa rally as the caption states.  The discrepancy arises from a significant conflict between visual interpretation (internal check) and verifiable external facts (external check). Because the external check provides verifiable data from a reputable source (Snopes.com, a well-known fact-checking website) directly contradicting the visual interpretation, it is necessary to prioritize the external evidence.  The visual assessment, while seemingly strong at first glance, is insufficient to override the factual evidence contradicting the caption's assertions about the event's location and attendance. The high confidence scores from both checks point to robust evidence from both perspectives. The final assessment rests on the weight of reliable external factual data presented by Snopes.com, which definitively contradicts the caption. Therefore, the caption is deemed to be out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check (high confidence) supports the caption based on visual analysis. External check (high confidence) contradicts the caption using verified data from Snopes.com, revealing the image was miscaptioned. External facts override visual interpretation resulting in a final verdict of 'out of context'."

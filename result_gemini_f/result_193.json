That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds the caption's claim of an FBI raid on the CDC to be unsupported by the image, which only shows the CDC building.  The external check corroborates this by citing Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, which explicitly debunks the claim as a hoax.  Snopes provides evidence that the claim originated from a known purveyor of misinformation and lacks any verifiable evidence.  The high confidence scores (10) from both checks, coupled with the alignment of their findings, leave no doubt that the caption is factually incorrect and unrelated to the image. There are no discrepancies to resolve, as both assessments agree completely. The entity analysis supports this conclusion: the image clearly shows the CDC building, aligning with the mention of the CDC in the caption; however, the image contains no elements related to the FBI, thereby contradicting the caption's claim of an FBI raid.  The significant weight given to both internal and external validation scores (10/10) produces a high level of confidence in the final assessment that the caption is indeed out of context.",

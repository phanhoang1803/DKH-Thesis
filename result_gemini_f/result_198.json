        "content": "US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened a government shutdown over funding for his proposed border wall in a budget row with top Democrats.\nDuring a heated exchange with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, Mr Trump said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government over border security.\nIf lawmakers cannot agree on a federal budget, funding for some departments will run out at the end of next week.\nMr Trump has asked to include $5bn (4bn) in the deal for border security.\nBut Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Pelosi said they had agreed to extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security at current levels of $1.3bn (1bn) until 30 September 2019.\nMr Trump opened the Oval Office meeting calling it a \"great honour\" to have Mr Schumer and Mrs Pelosi present, in their first meeting since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the November mid-term elections.\nBut the meeting soon turned contentious as Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer argued that the Republican-controlled Congress could pass legislation before funding for some agencies was set to expire on 21 December.\nThe president contended that it could only pass if it met his demands for more funding for his proposed border wall along the US southern border.\n\"If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,\" Mr Trump said.\n\"And I am proud to shut down the government for border security. I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.\"\nThe clock is ticking...\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington\nDonald Trump opened his press event with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer with a feel-good embrace of bipartisanship.\nIt didn't last long.\nThe two Democrats and the president sparred over funding for the Mr Trump's proposed border wall. It seemed for a moment as though they might agree on funding for \"border security\" - but that linguistic pirouette disappeared beneath an onslaught of acrimony.\nThe president wants his wall funding. He campaigned on it. He promised it. And even though Mexico isn't going to pay for it, he wants it now.\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are loath to give him this victory. What's more, they're intent on having the blame for any government shutdown directed solely at the president.\nIn the end Mr Trump gave the Democrats what they wanted. He said he would shut down the government if \"we don't get what we want\". He would be \"proud\" to do it.\nDemocrats will try to make the president regret those words. Mr Trump, on the other hand, thinks the public - or at least his base - is with him in this fight.\nIf neither side blinks, we'll know who is right in a few weeks.\nIn an official readout following the meeting, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Democrats have \"made clear they would rather keep the border open than the government open\".\nAfter the meeting, Democrat Chuck Schumer condemned Mr Trump's \"temper tantrum\" in the White House Oval Office.\nNancy Pelosi, who is expected to become Speaker of the House when Democrats take over the chamber next month, mocked Mr Trump at a later meeting with colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n\"I was trying to be the mom,\" she said, sources told US media. \"It goes to show you: you get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.\"\nShe reportedly added that the president's insistence on a wall was \"a manhood thing\".\nHours before the meeting, Mr Trump tweeted that \"the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall\".\nBut a defence department said later: \"To date, there is no plan to build sections of the wall.\"",

      "explanation": "Source 1 directly supports the claim that Ms. Pelosi argued with President Trump during a meeting about the border wall in the Oval Office.  The article recounts a heated exchange where Pelosi and Schumer argued with Trump about funding for the wall.  While the caption mentions \"last month\", the article describes an event that occurred shortly before its publication date, making the timeframe compatible. Pelosi's specific comments about the event are reported in the article, bolstering the validity of the caption. ",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly support the caption's accuracy. The internal check notes the setting (Oval Office), the participants (Pelosi, Trump, Pence, Schumer), and the body language (Pelosi and Trump gesturing emphatically) are all consistent with a heated argument.  The external check finds direct supporting evidence in a news article that corroborates the key elements of the caption: a meeting in the Oval Office between Pelosi, Trump, and others, where an argument occurred concerning the border wall.  The article further supports the claim by reporting on a contentious exchange and Pelosi's subsequent comments about the interaction. While the exact timeframe of \"last month\" is not precisely confirmed, the article describes an event that was recent, making it compatible with this description.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external validation. The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the alignment of details from the image and external source, strongly support the caption's accuracy. The minor ambiguity concerning the exact timeframe (\"last month\") is not sufficient to significantly reduce confidence in the caption's overall accuracy given the strong corroborating evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption.  The image, showing Pelosi and Trump in an animated discussion, aligns with the external source's reporting of a contentious meeting about the border wall.  Minor discrepancies regarding the specific timeframe are insignificant given the strong corroborating evidence."

        "content": "Claim:\nA federal gun law was passed in September 2016 which will prevent people from practicing \"open carry\" in all 50 states.\nOn 16 September 2016, the disreputable web site Associated Media Coverage published an article reporting that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had announced the implementation of a new gun law that would prevent \"open carry\" in all 50 states:\nRepresentatives from the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) have announced the implementation of a new federal gun law preventing the practice of open carry in all 50-states.\nThe term open carry refers to the practice of openly carrying a firearm in public which differs from concealed carry, where firearms cannot be seen by the casual observer.\nAccording to Carl Peterson, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the regulation was implemented in effort to create uniformity among states and increase public safety.\nWhile Associated Media Coverage provided several links in their article, giving it an appearance of credibility, none of those links directed readers to sources containing additional information about this purported new law.\nThe article also claimed that that the ATF had worked with the Brady Campaign, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, EveryTown for Gun Safety, and Moms Demand Action in implementing this alleged law, yet none of those groups has made any announcements regarding it. (Not to mention that the ATF is tasked with enforcing laws, not making them; the latter privilege still rests with the federal legislative body known as Congress.)\nAssociated Media Coverage is a well-known purveyor of fake news, a site that has previously published false stories concerning a motorcycle curfew and a ban on religious content on Facebook. Although many readers may now be familiar with Associated Media Coverage's reputation, the site has recently started publishing articles under the banner for a fictitious newspaper called \"The Boston Tribune\":\nWhile Associated Media Coverage may be changing their name to The Boston Tribune, their content is still nothing more than fake news.",

      "explanation": "The provided text is a fact-check article from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website. The article directly addresses the claim made in the news caption and explicitly debunks it as false.  The article details how the claim originated from a known purveyor of fake news, Associated Media Coverage, and highlights the lack of evidence supporting the claim. Therefore, based on this reputable fact-check, the verdict is false.",
      "supporting_points": "Snopes.com directly addresses and debunks the claim that a federal gun law passed in September 2016 prevents open carry in all 50 states. The article states the claim originated from a fake news website and cites the lack of evidence from reliable sources to support it.  Specific details within the article demonstrate the absence of evidence from reliable government sources, gun control groups mentioned in the false article, or any corroborating evidence.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a discrepancy between the image (showing open carry) and the caption's claim about a federal law preventing it.  The internal check gives a confidence score of 3 due to the lack of visual evidence confirming or denying the law's existence or effect. However, the external check provides strong evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, that completely refutes the caption's claim. Snopes demonstrates that the claim originated from a known source of fake news and lacks supporting evidence from reliable sources.  The external check has a confidence score of 10 due to the high credibility of Snopes and the detailed refutation presented.  The high confidence of the external check, combined with the internal check's identification of a discrepancy, strongly suggests the caption is out of context. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both point towards the caption's falsity, albeit from different angles. The external check provides definitive proof of the caption's inaccuracy, while the internal check highlights the visual inconsistency.  Therefore, based on the combined high confidence and consistent findings of both checks, the conclusion is that the caption is out of context and completely inaccurate.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate the caption is out of context. The internal check notes a discrepancy between the image and the caption's claim, while the external check uses a reputable source to definitively debunk the caption's claim.  The combined evidence yields high confidence in the conclusion."

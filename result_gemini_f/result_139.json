How do I know this? Because if they tried praying to Satan just once, theyd be doing it every day. Multiple times per day. Its really that powerful. Its a real trip.\nSpeaking at a Stella McCartney fashion event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Katy Perry denied rumors that she has undergone plastic surgery, and instead attributed her refreshed look to a new spiritual outlook.\nAdvising everybody to add praying to Satan to your bucket list, Katy Perry compared her first time praying to Satan to a mythical movie, When Beckie Met Chad.\nThere is no evidence that the singer made these comments, although Perry did attend the star-studded Stella McCartney \"Stellabration\" fashion event and party in Los Angeles. She has often been the focus of moral panic-tinged occult rumors perhaps fueled by her professional progression from Christian-themed musician to sometimes-risque pop singer who campaigned for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (who is also often the focus of satanism and occult hoaxes).\nPerry's only on-the-record comment at the event that we could find was to the style and culture publication The Cut:\n[Stella McCartney] is the definition of good vibrations. Really, Stella, her work is so phenomenal, but she is such a good vibe. ... Its just always fun, thats why we come, because its not work. The clothes are so great, theyre just so architectural this season, and its just a big fat get together where we can be ourselves, conversate, and meet again. Im on the road so Im not able to go to a lot of these things, so its fun for me tonight.",

    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges the image shows Katy Perry and that the caption mentions her and Satan. However, it correctly points out that the image itself cannot verify or refute the claim about Perry's statement. The external check, with a high confidence score of 10, definitively refutes the claim using a reputable fact-checking website (Snopes.com). Snopes provides evidence that the quote attributed to Perry is fabricated and originated from a known purveyor of fake news, Your News Wire.  This strong external evidence outweighs the inconclusive internal assessment. The conflict lies in the ability of the image to verify the claim. The image is irrelevant to the truthfulness of the statement made in the caption. The high confidence scores from both checks, although addressing different aspects, converge to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty; both analyses, when considered together, lead to the same conclusion: the caption is not supported by evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check is inconclusive regarding the claim's veracity, while the external check strongly refutes the caption's claim using Snopes.com as a reliable source.  The combined evidence points to the caption being out of context."

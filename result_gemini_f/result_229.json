        "content": "Claim:\nOn March 31, 2021, first lady Jill Biden mispronounced the Spanish phrase, Si Se Puede, during a speech.\nRating:\nTrue\nAbout this rating\nFirst lady Jill Biden has many accomplishments, but speaking Spanish may not be one of them.\nOn March 31, 2021, she visited the Forty Acres in California, a vaccination site and a National Historic Landmark that became the first headquarters of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), a labor union for farm workers across the country. That day, she was also honoring Csar Chvez, a UFW leader and civil rights activist who died in 1993.\nAt the end of her speech, she said, Cesar Chavez understood that no matter the obstacles, when people come together united in a cause, anything is possible. Yes we can. Si se puede!\nSi se puede (see-say-PWAY-day), which translates roughly to yes, it can be done or \"yes, we can,\" was the rallying cry for the UFW in the 1970s when it was advocating for working class Latinos and the rights of farm workers.\nBut Biden mispronounced the phrase as see-say-PWOD-day as she was closing out her speech. She can be heard mispronouncing it at 2:29 at the end of the video.\nIt should be noted that this was her third use of the phrase in the same speech, and she mispronounced it only the third time she said it. The correct pronunciation of the phrase can be heard in the video below:\nThis is not the first controversy that emerged from that speech. Many also claimed that Biden was standing in front of a Nazi-inspired flag, a story we previously debunked.\nGiven the evidence of her mispronunciation, we rate this claim as True.",

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions a claim that Jill Biden was standing in front of a Nazi-inspired flag.  Snopes, a fact-checking website, addresses this claim and debunks it.

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Jill Biden spoke in front of a Nazi-inspired flag. Both the internal and external checks strongly refute this claim. The internal check identifies the flag as that of the Aztec Empire, providing a high confidence score (2) for its assessment. The external check reinforces this by citing a Snopes fact-check that debunks the claim of a Nazi-inspired flag, further increasing the confidence level to 4.  There is a complete alignment between both checks; they unanimously reject the caption's assertion. The discrepancies are significant: the caption wrongly identifies the flag and presents false information as fact. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that the caption is out of context and misleading.  There's no ambiguity; the combined evidence from both types of checks points to a clear misrepresentation in the original caption. The high confidence scores, coupled with the complete agreement between internal and external assessments, solidify the conclusion that the caption is indeed out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively refute the caption's claim of a Nazi-inspired flag.  The flag is identified as Aztec, and the claim is debunked by a reliable fact-checking source.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external validations."

However, that lawsuit was about a records request and compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) related to Clinton's use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state -- it had nothing to do with the 2012 attack in Benghazi, was not a \"trial,\" and did not involve any appearance by Clinton herself in court.\nA House Select Committee extensively investigated the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead in Libya and issued a lengthy report that found no wrongdoing on the part of Clinton in connection with that event:\nEnding one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead.\nThe 800-page report delivered a broad rebuke of the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department  and the officials who led them  for failing to grasp the acute security risks in Benghazi, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect.\nPrevious investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation. But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim in the news caption. It states that while there was a court hearing in June 2020 related to Hillary Clinton and a public records request, it was not a trial for Benghazi.  The article clarifies that the hearing concerned a lawsuit about a FOIA request related to Clinton's email server, not the Benghazi attack.  This directly contradicts the caption's assertion that Clinton was \"'on trial' for Benghazi\". The Snopes article is a reputable fact-checking source, making its findings highly reliable.",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check points out a clear discrepancy: the image shows Hillary Clinton, but provides no visual evidence related to the Benghazi trial mentioned in the caption.  The lack of contextual visual cues within the image itself already casts significant doubt on the caption's accuracy. The external check further strengthens this conclusion by citing a Snopes fact-check.  Snopes directly refutes the claim, clarifying that the June 2020 event concerning Clinton was not a trial for Benghazi, but rather a court hearing related to a FOIA lawsuit about her email server. The high confidence scores (10/10) from both checks, coupled with the corroborating evidence, eliminate any reasonable doubt about the caption's inaccuracy.  The external validation offers compelling evidence from a reputable source, thereby reinforcing the internal assessment. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and conclusively confirm the caption is out of context.  The image is simply a picture of Hillary Clinton; it does not depict any event related to the Benghazi accusations, which are the central focus of the caption's claim.  The alignment of entities (Hillary Clinton) is present, but the context (a trial in June 2020 for Benghazi) is entirely missing and factually inaccurate according to the Snopes verification. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the findings; the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks (confidence score of 10 each) confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows Hillary Clinton but lacks any visual connection to the Benghazi trial mentioned in the caption.  External fact-checking from Snopes corroborates this finding."

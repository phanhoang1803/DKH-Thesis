While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

    "explanation": "The caption claims that Ted Nugent, a 70s rocker, hunting guide, and conservative icon, was shot and killed in a hunting accident. This claim is directly contradicted by both internal and external evidence.  Internally, the provided image shows Ted Nugent alive and playing a guitar, which is inconsistent with the caption's assertion of his death. The internal check highlights a significant discrepancy with high confidence (confidence_score: 10).  Externally, fact-checking from Snopes.com definitively debunks the death claim, stating that Nugent is alive and well, and citing evidence such as a Facebook Live video made by Nugent and his wife shortly after the hoax started circulating. The external check also achieves a high confidence score (confidence_score: 10).  Both the internal image analysis and the external fact-check from a reputable source strongly support the conclusion that the caption is false. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and unequivocally confirm that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) further solidify this conclusion. Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context, with a confidence score of 10.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal (image analysis) and external (Snopes fact-check) validation strongly and independently confirm that the caption is false.  The image shows Nugent alive, and Snopes debunks the death hoax.  There is complete agreement between the two checks, resulting in a high confidence score."

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both largely agree that the caption is likely inaccurate.  The internal check highlights a discrepancy: the image depicts Edinburgh at night, but the caption emphasizes a specific astronomical event (the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn) which is not visually present in the image. Although the photographer's name is mentioned, the focus is on an event not captured in the photo. The external check supports the plausibility of the Great Conjunction and the photographer's intent, but it acknowledges the lack of direct evidence linking the photo to the specific astronomical event.  Both checks give a confidence score of 8, indicating a strong belief in their respective conclusions. There's no conflict between internal and external findings.  Both point to a mismatch between the claim in the caption (the image depicts the conjunction) and the content of the image itself.  The lack of visual evidence of the conjunction in the image heavily weighs against the caption's accuracy.  While the photograph might have been taken during the Great Conjunction, or even taken by Gavin Dougan, the caption's claim that it depicts the conjunction is not supported by the image content.  Even with a high confidence score from both checks, the core issue is the lack of the astronomical event in the provided image.  Therefore, the conclusion is that the caption is out of context because the image does not support its primary claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks independently assess the caption as likely inaccurate, with high confidence (8/10).  The key discrepancy is the lack of visual evidence of Jupiter and Saturn's conjunction in the provided image, despite it being the central point of the caption."

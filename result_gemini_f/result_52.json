But it is the nickname of the biggest bell in the belfry that draws the most name recognition: Big Ben.\nDuring the past five years, the clock, which has four dials, was dismantled and serviced for the first time since it started ticking in 1859. More than 3,500 parts were removed from the 316-foot tower, including much of its iron roof.\nAt the end of the day, you could say it is just a series of concentric stone shafts with a bloody great clock on top, said Adam Watrobski, the chief architect of the towers restoration, which cost 80 million pounds, or about $97 million. But its the symbolism, the size of the great clock of Westminster, that gives it its importance.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

    "explanation": "The caption accurately reflects the image's content. The internal check shows high confidence (10) because the image clearly depicts the Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), which is synonymous with the British Parliament's clock tower, undergoing renovation as evidenced by the extensive scaffolding.  The external check also provides strong support (8) citing a reputable news source (New York Times) that corroborates the ongoing renovation of Big Ben.  The external check's supporting points directly mention the five-year renovation and the return of the iconic clock's sound, further strengthening the validity of the caption. There is strong alignment between the image's visual content and the information conveyed in the caption, reinforced by a reliable external source.  No discrepancies are found between internal and external checks. Both assessments point towards a high degree of accuracy. The confidence score of 9 reflects this strong agreement. The slight reduction from a perfect 10 accounts for the possibility of subtle nuances or interpretations that might not be entirely captured in the concise caption.",

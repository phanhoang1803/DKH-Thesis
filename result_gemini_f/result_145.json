        "content": "Claim:\nOn Feb. 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden uttered a racial slur referring to Black people in a recorded speech.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late February 2021, several social media users alleged U.S. President Joe Biden used the N-word while addressing world leaders at a virtual event to discuss international security policies.\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, an annual event that convenes hundreds of policy makers from across the world, Biden spoke on camera for roughly 20 minutes on Feb. 19, describing his administration's desire to be on good terms with the European Union.\nApproximately three-quarters of the way into his remarks, social media users alleged he uttered the racial slur referring to Black people. Some people accused the president of saying the N-word accidentally, while others raised the possibility that he intentionally made the alleged racist comment.\nOne conservative commentator pointed to closed captioning on recordings of the speech on YouTube as alleged evidence of the president indeed saying the word, despite the fact the video platform's captioning system runs on computer-generated, speech-recognition software that is known for error and not necessarily a true indication of what someone said.\nTo investigate the legitimacy of the underlying allegation  whether the president at any point during the virtual Munich Security Conference event used the N-word for whatever reason  we obtained an official White House transcript, as well as a video recording via C-SPAN, of Biden's speech.\nConsidering that the social media posts made use of brief video clips of his alleged comments around the 16-minute mark in the C-Span footage, we focused on that portion of his remarks, specifically. At that point, he said, according to the transcript and video footage:\n\"Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear  Im eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.\"\nWhile saying \"I'm eager to hear,\" Biden stuttered, repeating the phrase three times. On the third time, the consonant \"mmmm\" in the word \"I'm\" blended with the next word, \"eager,\" to make a \"mnnm-eager\" sound. That was the source of the social media posts' allegations, despite the fact that the hypothetical insertion of the N-word there would be abrupt and confusing, contextually speaking, no matter what the speaker's reason for saying it.\nA more plausible reason for the president's phrasing in that moment was his speech disorder.\nOn several occasions, Biden has openly discussed his struggle with stuttering over the course of his life. It is a speech impediment and neurological disorder that may result in repetitions (D-d-d-dog), prolongations (Mmmmmmilk), or blocks (an absence of sound), according to the non-profit National Stuttering Association. The instance Munich Security Conference appeared to be a combination of repeating and prolonging phonetic sounds.\nIn other words, the claim is false  Biden did not use the N-word in that moment, nor at any other time during the virtual speech.",

      "explanation": "The claim in the news caption is directly addressed and debunked by a fact-checking article from Snopes.com.  The article investigates the claim that President Biden used a racial slur during a speech on February 19, 2021, and concludes that the claim is false. The alleged slur was based on a misinterpretation of Biden's stutter, which was confirmed by reviewing official transcripts and video recordings of his speech. Therefore, the caption is contradicted by a highly reliable source.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a mismatch between the image (Biden giving a speech) and the caption's claim of him using a racial slur. The lack of visual evidence for the slur lowers confidence. The external check strongly refutes the claim using a fact-check from Snopes.com, which provides evidence contradicting the caption's assertion.  Both checks align in concluding the caption is false and out of context. The high confidence scores (10) from both checks reinforce this conclusion. There's no discrepancy between the internal and external checks; they both independently confirm the caption's falsity. The external check's detailed explanation and reliance on a credible fact-checking website strengthens the overall confidence level. The analysis of the provided image reveals no visual evidence supporting the claim. The caption's claim is directly contradicted by reliable external evidence, leading to a high degree of certainty that the caption is out of context.  The image only shows Biden giving a speech; it does not provide any information regarding the content of his speech. Therefore, the information presented in the caption cannot be verified or supported by the provided visual. This lack of visual evidence, combined with the external fact-check definitively refuting the claim, confirms the caption's inaccuracy and leads to a strong confidence level in the out-of-context determination.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check flags the lack of visual evidence, while the external check provides a reliable source directly refuting the claim."

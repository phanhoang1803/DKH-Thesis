Several disturbing images from the blackout went viral on social media. One image shared on several different Twitter accounts, however, had nothing to do with that power outage, despite claims to the contrary:\nThe author of the above tweet asserted this image to be taken in Texas during the 2021 blackouts, but this is impossible. The image used in that tweet has been on the internet for years.\nFor example, the image appears in a January 2018 article on EbaumsWorld titled \"36 Amusing Pictures That Will Destroy Your Boredom.\" It can be found, as well, in a December 2019 article about preventing frozen pipes on the website of the company Thompson Building Associates.\nBecause the photo predates the Texas blackout by several years, online claims linking it to current events in Texas are \"False.\"",

      "explanation": "The claim is directly addressed and debunked by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website.  Snopes demonstrates that the image is older than the Texas blackout and has circulated online for several years.  Therefore, the claim linking the image to the blackout is false.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check aligns with the caption's description of the image, showing high confidence (score 10) in the image's depiction of a large indoor icicle. However, the external check, using Snopes as a source, strongly refutes the caption's claim that this image was taken during the Texas blackout of February 2021. Snopes provides evidence demonstrating the image's existence predates the blackout by several years, resulting in a high confidence score (10) for the refutation.  The conflict arises from the internal assessment focusing solely on image content, while the external validation considers the temporal context and verifiable information from a reputable source.  Because the external evidence decisively contradicts the temporal claim in the caption, and its confidence score is equally high, we must conclude the caption is out of context. The internal validation's focus on visual alignment is insufficient to outweigh the externally validated temporal inaccuracy.  The high confidence scores from both checks reinforce the conclusion that the caption's link to the Texas blackout is incorrect.  There is no ambiguity in this case; the reputable source provides irrefutable evidence contradicting the caption's claim. The entity analysis reinforces the external validation because the image's origin (the fact-checked source) does not corroborate the context of the Texas blackout.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the image description but external check (Snopes) strongly refutes the temporal claim, showing high confidence in its contradiction. The external check's evidence decisively outweighs the internal assessment.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context."

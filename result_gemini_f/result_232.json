      "explanation": "The statement \"Moving forward to a better future for the DRC\" is a common political slogan and aspiration.  While it's not factually incorrect, it lacks specific details and is therefore difficult to definitively verify.  Felix Tshisekedi's presidency in the DRC has involved efforts towards improvement, but whether these constitute a \"better future\" is subjective and requires more specific assessment of his policies and their impact. The hashtag usage is typical of political social media posts.",
      "supporting_points": "Felix Tshisekedi is the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  Political leaders frequently use optimistic language about the future of their countries.  The DRC faces significant challenges including poverty, conflict, and infrastructure deficits.",

    }
  },
  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses low confidence (confidence_score = 3) because the image lacks visual evidence to support the caption's claim about Tshisekedi and the DRC's future.  The image shows a group of men in suits, but doesn't identify any of them as Tshisekedi or provide any context related to the DRC's future. The external check, while showing higher confidence (confidence_score = 8), acknowledges the inherent difficulty in verifying vague, aspirational statements common in political contexts.  Although Felix Tshisekedi is the President of the DRC and the caption is not factually incorrect in a broad sense, the statement about a \"better future\" is subjective and requires more concrete evidence to verify. The external check supports the caption's plausibility based on Tshisekedi's role and the common use of such slogans, but it falls short of definitive verification.  The discrepancy arises from the fundamentally different approaches. The internal check focuses solely on visual evidence within the image, while the external check uses broader knowledge and context.  Because the internal check is based on direct image analysis and finds no supporting evidence, while the external check relies on inference and general political context, the final conclusion favors the more conservative internal assessment.  The lack of explicit visual or textual evidence linking the image to the caption's claim in the photograph itself leads to the 'OOC' conclusion.  Neither check provides a strong affirmation, thus yielding a moderate confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds no visual evidence linking the image to the caption's claims. External check acknowledges the caption's plausibility due to general political context but lacks concrete verification.  Discrepancy arises from differing validation methods. The lack of visual support outweighs the general plausibility, resulting in an 'out of context' assessment."

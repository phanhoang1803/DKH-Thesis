Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map  with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\nCruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernies base,\" implied  if not directly asserted  that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\nThis is Bernies base  the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment  no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\nKimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim in the news caption. While the video does show individuals failing to identify countries on a map, Snopes points out that those individuals were randomly selected and not necessarily Bernie Sanders supporters.  The context of the video, a comedy segment, is crucial.  Therefore, the claim lacks the necessary support to be considered definitively true. Although the video itself might exist, the caption's assertion about the political affiliation of those in the video is inaccurate according to the fact-check.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows a relatively high confidence score (10) because the image aligns with the caption's description of a person (potentially a Bernie Sanders supporter) in front of a world map. The context suggests a possible scenario fitting the caption's narrative. However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score 8) contradicting the caption's claim about the political affiliation of the individuals in the video. The Snopes fact-check reveals that the video participants were randomly selected and not identified as Bernie Sanders supporters, undermining the caption's core assertion.  This discrepancy needs careful consideration. The external check's high confidence stems from a reputable fact-checking source directly addressing the video's claim. The key conflict is in the individuals' political affiliation, which is crucial to the caption's meaning. The entity analysis supports the external check by confirming that the video's context is a comedy segment, thus questioning the assumption about all subjects being Bernie Sanders supporters. Considering both checks and the external check's evidence from a reliable source, the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the external validation in contradicting the caption's claim regarding political affiliation, while acknowledging that the image itself does not fully contradict a portion of the caption (the presence of a world map and someone being tested on geography).",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds partial alignment, while external check strongly refutes the caption's claim about the political affiliation of the individuals shown in the video.  The external evidence from Snopes is decisive in concluding that the caption is out of context."

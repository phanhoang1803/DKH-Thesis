    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (8) in the accuracy of the caption in representing the image content. The image depicts a cow near what appears to be a tailor shop in Rajasthan. However, the external check reveals a complete lack of supporting evidence.  There are no articles or reliable sources that corroborate the existence of a book titled \"The Cow and the Tailor Shop\" by Elizabeth Brooks from the US, set in Rajasthan. The discrepancy highlights the limitation of relying solely on visual interpretation for caption verification. While the image aligns well with the description of a cow and a tailor shop in Rajasthan (internally validated), the absence of any external evidence to support the specific authorship and title makes the overall claim highly questionable. The low confidence score reflects this uncertainty. Given the conflicting results and the absence of external corroboration for the book information, we conclude that the caption is likely out of context, despite the strong internal alignment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the image content, but the external check fails to find any evidence supporting the book details in the caption. This significant discrepancy results in a low confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

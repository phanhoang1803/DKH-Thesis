However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch between the caption and the image content. The image depicts a massive rally, likely in Cuba given the architectural style and flags visible, while the caption describes a Bernie Sanders rally in California.  This is a clear discrepancy in terms of location, scale, and political context. The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this evident mismatch. \n\nThe external check, however, introduces a complicating factor. It claims to verify the caption's assertion that Bernie Sanders held rallies in California, citing news articles covering such events.  The external check's confidence score of 8 is based on the verification of Sanders' rallies in California but does not address the specific image.  The discrepancy lies in the fact that the external validation only confirms the occurrence of Sanders rallies in California, not that the *specific image* depicts one of these rallies.\n\nThe conflict arises from the different levels of granularity in the validation attempts. The internal check directly compares the image content to the caption, while the external check verifies a broader claim (Sanders' California rallies) without examining the image.  There is no entity alignment between the image and the caption according to the internal check because the image shows a vastly different event and location. The external check's focus on verifying a general claim about Sanders rallies, while ignoring image specifics, creates a conflict.\n\nTo resolve this conflict, we must prioritize the direct image-caption comparison. The internal check, with its direct analysis of visual elements, provides a more accurate assessment of the caption's suitability for the image.  The external check's verification of the general claim about Sanders rallies is useful but irrelevant to the specific image in question.  Since the image clearly does not depict a Bernie Sanders rally in California, and this mismatch is directly evidenced in the image itself, the caption is demonstrably out of context.\n\nTherefore, although the external check provides supporting evidence for the existence of Sanders' rallies in California, it does not alter the fundamental incompatibility between the image content and the caption's description.  The high confidence score (9) reflects the certainty derived from this direct image-caption analysis coupled with the corroboration of Sanders' California rallies. The conclusion that the caption is out of context is based primarily on the definitive visual mismatch demonstrated in the image and validated by the internal check.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds a significant mismatch between the image (a large rally, likely in Cuba) and the caption (a Bernie Sanders rally in California). External check verifies the occurrence of Sanders' California rallies but doesn't analyze the image itself.  The internal check's assessment of a caption out of context is prioritized due to its direct comparison of image and caption."

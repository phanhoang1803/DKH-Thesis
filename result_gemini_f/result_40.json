        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim in the news caption.  While it acknowledges that a list of 53,000 deceased individuals was found on Florida's voter rolls, it debunks the implication that these people voted. The article highlights that this discovery was part of a routine process to update voter rolls and that the claim was spread as part of unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows a relatively high confidence score (10) in the caption's plausibility, based on the reasonable inference that the image depicts ballot handling, which could be related to voter rolls.  However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score 10) that contradicts the caption's implication. The Snopes article confirms the existence of 53,000 deceased individuals on Florida's voter rolls, but crucially, it refutes the suggestion that these people actually voted. This discrepancy arises because the caption focuses on the number of deceased individuals on the rolls, creating a misleading narrative of widespread voter fraud.  The image itself is neutral; it doesn't show fraudulent activity or even explicitly depict Florida's voter rolls. The connection is drawn solely based on the assumption that the documents are ballots and the context of the caption. Thus, the external check undermines the caption's implied meaning, while the internal check focuses only on the superficial connection between the image content and the caption.   The high confidence scores from both checks highlight a significant conflict. The external validation provides a much more accurate context by clarifying that the discovery was part of a routine process to update voter rolls, and it debunks the implication of voter fraud.  The discrepancy is resolved by prioritizing the external validation.   Given the evidence provided by the Snopes article, there's no reasonable basis to infer that the image directly supports the caption's implication. Although the image could be related to ballot handling in a general sense, the caption's implication of voter fraud based on the number of deceased individuals on the rolls is misleading and unsubstantiated, according to the external validation, making the original caption out of context. The final assessment is strongly based on the external check's verification of the facts and the clarification of the actual context. ",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check suggests a plausible link, but external check strongly refutes the caption's implication of voter fraud, showing the caption is out of context.  The external evidence is deemed more reliable due to its factual accuracy and source credibility."

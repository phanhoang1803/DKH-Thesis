That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds no evidence of an FBI raid in the image, which only shows the exterior of the CDC building.  The confidence score for this is 10, reflecting absolute certainty based on the visual evidence.  The external check uses Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, to confirm that the claim of an FBI raid on the CDC to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism is a hoax. Snopes directly refutes the caption's assertion, providing a confidence score of 10.  There is perfect agreement between the internal and external checks.  Both checks point to the caption's falsity with high confidence. The image depicts the CDC building, while the caption describes a non-existent event. There's no ambiguity; the image shows only a building, and the caption describes a specific event (an FBI raid) which is factually incorrect according to the external validation.  No further analysis or reconciliation is necessary, as both validation methods concur completely and decisively.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows the CDC building, but the caption falsely describes an FBI raid and the acquisition of data linking vaccines to autism.  The external source, Snopes, directly debunks this claim."

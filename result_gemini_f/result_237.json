However, Hurricane Laura (or any other weather event) was not the culprit for this bizarre scene.\nThe above-displayed picture was taken in Mobile, Alabama, below the Dog River Bridge circa Aug. 31, 2020, and it shows the aftermath of a traffic accident. According to local news outlet WKRG, a boat full of a fisherman's catch fell 40 feet off the Dog River Bridge to the road below and in the process left portions of the net, as well as several fish, stuck up in the power lines.\nHere's a better look at the fish stuck in the power line:\nWKRG wrote:\nA boat fell 40 feet from the Dog River bridge onto the road below.\nOn the way down it took out some power lines and caused a mess on the road. The boat was badly damaged and the catch of the day was thrown across the road.\nIt's not clear what caused the accident, but WKRG reported that nobody was hurt. Here's a video news report about the incident that includes a few additional images of this fishy scene:",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim in the news caption.  It confirms that the image of sharks in power lines circulated widely after Hurricane Laura, but it importantly clarifies that the incident was not caused by the hurricane.  Instead, the sharks (along with other fish) became entangled in power lines following a traffic accident involving a boat carrying a fisherman's catch. The article provides details about the accident location and source of the information supporting the event while debunking the false association with Hurricane Laura.",

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the visual presence of fish in power lines, which is consistent with the image.  It assigns a high confidence score (10) based solely on this visual alignment. However, the external check, using Snopes as a source, reveals a significant discrepancy. While confirming the image's authenticity and the fact that fish were indeed found in power lines, it refutes the claim that this incident resulted from Hurricane Laura.  The Snopes article attributes the occurrence to a traffic accident involving a boat carrying a fisherman's catch. This external validation carries a high confidence score (10) because it provides details and sources supporting its findings. The conflict lies in the causal explanation: The caption links the event to Hurricane Laura, while the external check connects it to a traffic accident.  Because the external check offers strong evidence and corroboration, the internal check's assessment needs to be revised. The high confidence score from both checks (10 each) reinforces the significance of this discrepancy. The difference in causal explanation is substantial.  Entity analysis shows clear alignment in terms of the fish in the power lines, but the source of the event differs greatly.  Therefore, the caption is determined to be out of context because, although it correctly depicts the event visually, its causal explanation is factually incorrect according to a reliable external source.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the image's visual content, assigning high confidence (10). External check (Snopes) confirms the image but refutes the hurricane-related causal claim from the caption, providing strong evidence for a different cause (traffic accident) with high confidence (10).  The discrepancy lies in the event's origin, making the caption out of context."

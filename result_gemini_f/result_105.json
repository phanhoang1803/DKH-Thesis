While the image supports the presence of President Biden, it does not confirm the specific executive order or the year. The image only shows Biden in the act of signing something, so the context is unclear without further information. Therefore, only the presence of Joe Biden is confirmed with high confidence.",

        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\nOrigin\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\" This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City policy  commonly referred to as the global gag rule. The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot  unlike the global gag rule  be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that bodys sexual and reproductive health agency whose mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled.\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the domestic gag rule  a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. Organizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services, the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations. Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim made in the news caption.  It explicitly states that President Biden did not sign an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad. Instead, Biden rescinded the \"global gag rule\", a policy that prevented U.S. funding from going to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions.  The Snopes article clarifies that direct U.S. funding of abortions abroad has been banned since 1973 by the Helms Amendment, which requires Congressional action to overturn, not an executive order. The Snopes article is a reputable fact-checking source, and its detailed analysis directly contradicts the caption's assertion.",

    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges the presence of President Biden signing a document, aligning with the image. However, it lacks certainty about the specific executive order and the year mentioned in the caption.  The external check, using Snopes as a reliable source, decisively refutes the caption's claim. Snopes clarifies that President Biden rescinded the \"global gag rule,\" which restricted U.S. funding to organizations involved in abortion-related activities, not directly funding abortions abroad.  The Helms Amendment, it points out, prohibits direct U.S. funding of abortions abroad; this requires Congressional action to change, not an executive order.  The high confidence score from the external check (10) strongly outweighs the lower confidence score from the internal check (10), which only confirms Biden's presence in the picture but cannot verify the context. The significant discrepancy between the internal and external results arises from the caption's inaccuracy in describing the specific executive order and its impact.  The image itself, lacking specific details about the document being signed, is insufficient to validate the caption's claim.  The external check, providing factual evidence from a reputable source, provides definitive proof that the caption is misrepresenting the event.  Therefore, considering the strong evidence from Snopes, along with the internal check's inability to fully verify the caption's specifics, we confidently conclude the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially confirms Biden's presence but cannot verify the executive order details. External check (Snopes) strongly refutes the caption, showing it misrepresents Biden's actions. The external evidence decisively outweighs the inconclusive internal assessment, indicating the caption is out of context."

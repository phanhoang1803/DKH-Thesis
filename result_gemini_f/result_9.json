On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no visual evidence in the image to support the claim of a 9-year-old girl being impregnated by a Muslim man.  The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete lack of support from the image itself.  The external check provides strong evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website.  Snopes definitively debunks the claim, stating that the image depicts a 12-year-old Brazilian girl with an enlarged liver and spleen, and that the image has been misused to spread Islamophobic rumors. The confidence score of 10 reflects the high reliability of Snopes and the direct contradiction of the original caption. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both independently and conclusively demonstrate the caption's inaccuracy. The high confidence score of 10 is a result of this strong agreement.  The image itself shows a child with a visibly distended abdomen, which could be indicative of various medical conditions, but offers no indication of pregnancy or any connection to the specific details mentioned in the caption.  Any interpretation attempting to link the image to the caption's claims would be purely speculative and unsupported by evidence. The Snopes article provides crucial contextual information that completely refutes the original caption, highlighting the importance of verifying information from credible sources before accepting it as factual.  In conclusion, the overwhelming evidence from both internal visual analysis and external fact-checking points to the caption being completely false and entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly reject the caption. Internal analysis finds no evidence in the image to support the claim. External validation from Snopes.com confirms the image's misrepresentation and debunks the claim, showing the caption is false and promotes Islamophobia."

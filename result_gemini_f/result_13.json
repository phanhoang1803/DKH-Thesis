        "content": "A new exhibition of photographs capturing a \"pivotal\" decade in Sheffield's history has opened.\nTaken in the 1980s, the pictures show the contrast between the demise of the city's industrial past and the \"new hope\" of major building projects.\nCurator Matthew Conduit said the images documented Sheffield's fight for a new identity against a backdrop of unemployment and dereliction.\nThe exhibition runs until 3 May at Sheffield's Weston Park Museum.\nAmong the images, taken by photographers including John Davies, John Kippin, and Anna Fox, are pictures of former city landmarks, such as Hadfield's Steel Works, the \"Hole in the Road\" and the Don Valley Stadium - all three of which have since been demolished.\nMr Conduit, a former director of the Untitled Gallery, now the Site Gallery in Brown Street, said the images were the result of a series of commissions \"to document the city at a pivotal moment in its history\".\n\"It was a very strange period in Sheffield, and when I first started pulling this show together, it did occur to me that there's a whole generation of people in Sheffield who just do not know it used to be like that,\" he said.\n\"I remember photographing Don Valley from Wincobank at that time and it was just a sea of sheds, you couldn't see the ground at all, it was full of steel foundries. But all that changed very swiftly towards the end of the 80s and now most of it is gone.\n\"It was odd in that at the time the miners' strike had been and gone, there was massive redundancy in the steel industry and generally Sheffield was facing a lot of negative job numbers and was fighting for its life in many ways.\n\"So there was this strange contrast at the time between this sort of new hope that was starting to emerge out of the ground and the people really struggling and questioning what the city's future was going to be.\"\nPhotographer Tim Smith, whose work is featured in the exhibition, moved to Sheffield in 1984 to take photos for the government's 1986 \"Industry Year\" promotion.\n\"You could smell Sheffield and hear Sheffield as you drove towards it but you could not see very much of it because it all happened in these great cavernous steel mills or dusty little mesters' workshops,\" he said.\n\"I left the city [a few years later] when everything was being knocked down and before it was rebuilt.\n\"Personally for me it felt like I was witnessing the end of an era.\n\"Seeing something like Hadfield's, once the biggest steelworks in the world, being demolished made me feel really sad.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption mentions \"Castle Square, also known as the \"Hole in the Road\", 1989\".  Source 1, from a reputable news source (BBC), mentions the demolition of a landmark called the \"Hole in the Road\" in Sheffield during the 1980s. While the article doesn't explicitly state the year 1989, the timeframe aligns perfectly with the caption. The context of the article discussing Sheffield's transformation in the 1980s strongly supports the caption's claim. Although the name \"Castle Square\" is not mentioned, the reference to \"Hole in the Road\" and the timeframe makes a strong link. Therefore, while there isn't explicit mention of the full name of the place, the implied relation and time-frame strongly suggests the caption is likely true.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, strongly supporting the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows Castle Square, identifiable by the distinctive circular underpass, nicknamed \"Hole in the Road.\" The architectural style and overall aesthetic of the image are consistent with the 1980s, aligning with the provided year.  The external check, while providing a confidence score of 8, also supports the caption's accuracy. Although the external source doesn't explicitly mention \"Castle Square,\" it references the demolition of the \"Hole in the Road\" in Sheffield during the 1980s. This aligns with the caption's information and the visual evidence presented in the image.  The discrepancy lies in the lack of explicit mention of \"Castle Square\" in the external source. However, the strong contextual evidence linking the \"Hole in the Road\" in Sheffield to Castle Square, combined with the clear visual representation in the image, makes it highly probable that the caption accurately describes the image.  The high confidence scores from both internal and external checks, combined with the strong contextual evidence, lead to a final confidence score of 9.  The absence of contradicting information from either internal or external checks further supports this high confidence level. The minor discrepancy (lack of explicit mention of \"Castle Square\" in the external source) is outweighed by the strong evidence from both checks, indicating a high likelihood that the caption accurately represents the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy, with minor discrepancies that are outweighed by the overall evidence. The image clearly depicts Castle Square's \"Hole in the Road,\" and external sources corroborate the timeframe and the existence of this landmark. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) reinforce the validity of the caption."

        "content": "Claim:\nSome 53,000 dead people were found to be included in Florida's voter rolls in November 2018.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image depicts individuals handling what appear to be ballots or similar paper documents, an activity not directly related to the claim of 53,000 deceased individuals appearing on voter rolls.  The internal check points out the lack of any connection between the image content and the caption's assertion, assigning a confidence score of 0.  The external check, with a much higher confidence score of 8, relies on a Snopes fact-check article. This article verifies the existence of a list containing 53,000 deceased individuals identified on Florida's voter rolls in November 2018. However, crucially, the article clarifies that this list was discovered during an ongoing effort to cleanse the voter rolls and that there was no evidence these individuals actually cast ballots.  The Snopes article further emphasizes the claim's propagation via social media and its association with unfounded allegations of voter fraud. This confirms the claim is false. The external source's high confidence score, together with the internal check's assessment, provides compelling evidence for the caption's misrepresentation of the image content. Thus, the claim is out of context; the image does not depict the situation described in the caption.  The high agreement between both checks and the robust external validation strongly support the conclusion that the caption is completely unrelated to the image.  There is no ambiguity or conflict between the internal and external analysis. Both approaches align perfectly in assessing the caption's context. The fact-check provides substantial external validation, exceeding the image's inherent limitations in providing evidence of voter fraud. There is no evidence suggesting voter fraud in this image; the action shown is simply people examining documents.  Therefore, given the strong concordance between the internal and external validations, the caption is undeniably out of context, with a high degree of confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image shows people handling documents, unrelated to the claim of deceased voters.  External validation through Snopes confirms the falsity of the claim, even though a list of deceased individuals was found, they did not vote."

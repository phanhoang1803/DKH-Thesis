It was -5C (23F) in Manchester and Edinburgh and -3C (27F) in south-west London and Birmingham.\nSnow swept across south-west England, parts of Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, while hilly areas - including the North York Moors and parts of Scotland - will see more snow later, forecasters said.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

      "explanation": "The provided text mentions heavy snow in Glasgow and its impact on transportation and sporting events. While it doesn't directly state that people walked through snow in Victoria Park, the widespread snowfall in Glasgow makes it plausible.  The article focuses more on the disruption caused by the snow rather than descriptions of people's activities. Therefore, we can't definitively confirm or deny the caption based solely on this article.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy, based on the visual alignment of the image with the described scene. The external check, however, has lower confidence (4), acknowledging a lack of direct evidence linking the image specifically to Victoria Park in Glasgow, despite the plausibility given the reported heavy snowfall in the city.  The discrepancy arises from the external source focusing on the broader impact of the snowfall rather than detailed descriptions of people's activities in specific locations.  Therefore, while the image strongly suggests a scene consistent with the caption's description, the absence of explicit confirmation from external sources reduces the overall confidence level.  To reach a more definitive conclusion, additional evidence is needed, such as photographic metadata, news reports with explicit mention of people walking in Victoria Park during that snowfall, or corroborating images from the same timeframe and location. The final confidence score reflects a balance between the strong internal visual consistency and the weaker external corroboration. While the caption is plausible and visually supported, the lack of direct external verification prevents reaching the higher confidence level of the internal check. The image strongly aligns with the general context of snowfall in Glasgow, but further evidence is necessary to confirm with certainty its location as Victoria Park. The high internal confidence score emphasizes the visual coherence of the image with the caption, suggesting the scene likely depicts people walking through snow, and the environment suggests a park setting possibly in Glasgow.  However, the absence of explicit external confirmation linking the image specifically to Victoria Park during the snowfall lowers the final confidence score.  There is no conflict in the sense that both checks are consistent with the general context of heavy snowfall in Glasgow and people walking in the snow. The difference is simply in the level of specificity of their statements. This lack of complete confirmation regarding the exact location necessitates a more conservative confidence score than the purely visual assessment suggests.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption (confidence 10) based on visual evidence. External check provides weaker support (confidence 4) due to lack of direct mention of Victoria Park, but acknowledges plausibility given city-wide snowfall. Discrepancy stems from differing specificity of evidence; image strongly suggests the general scenario, but lacks precise location confirmation. Final confidence reflects a balance between strong visual alignment and weaker external corroboration."

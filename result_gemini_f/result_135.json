One popular versions, which garnered tens of thousands of shares, was posted to the \"Amazing World\" Facebook page in April 2017 with the query \"Insane Cliff House ? Would you live in it?\":\nThis is not a genuine photograph of a habitable (or even existent) home on the underside of a cliff. Rather, it's a piece of digital art created as part of an advertising campaign for a concrete adhesive.\nThis \"Insane Cliff House\" image was one of several produced by the creative advertising agency JWT in 2013 to promote a line of Fester brand construction products. The \"Somos ms de lo que imaginas\" (\"We are more than you imagine\") campaign pictured Henkel's line of Fester construction products performing amazing and improbable feats, such as securing a house (with a pool) to the underside of a cliff.\nThe brand shared a version of the print advertisement on their Facebook page:",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the caption as true based solely on the visual representation of the image. The image depicts a house seemingly built under a cliff, appearing structurally sound and potentially inhabitable. However, the external check strongly refutes this assessment, citing a reputable source, Snopes, which verifies that the image is a digitally created artwork, not a real structure.  This discrepancy arises from the difference between visual interpretation and factual verification. The internal check relies only on the visual data, while the external check uses factual information from a reliable source. The high confidence score of 10 in the external check, supported by evidence from Snopes, significantly outweighs the internal check's score, even if the internal score is also 10. Snopes clearly states that the image is not a photograph of a real habitable home, and instead, it's digital art used for an advertising campaign for concrete adhesive. This external evidence decisively demonstrates that the caption's assertion of a \"real, inhabitable house\" is false. Therefore, the caption is out of context because it misrepresents the image's true nature. The external validation's strong evidence and explicit refutation of the caption's claim lead to the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and therefore out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check deemed the caption true based on visual interpretation; however, an external fact-check (Snopes) conclusively proved it false. The external evidence is definitive, resulting in a final OOC assessment of 'true'."

        "content": "Last summer, in the dead of night, three peace activists penetrated the exterior of Y-12 in Tennessee, supposedly one of the most secure nuclear-weapons facilities in the United States. A drifter, an 82-year-old nun and a house painter. They face trial next week on charges that fall under the sabotage section of the U.S. criminal code. And if they had been terrorists armed with explosives, intent on mass destruction? That nightmare scenario underlies the governments response to the intrusion. This is the story of two competing worldviews, of conscience vs. court, of fantasy vs. reality, of history vs. the future.\nChapter 1\nMission\nThe devil was just over Pine Ridge.\nFrom the deserted parking lot on the edge of town, the three servants of God looked into darkness.\nThey clicked on their flashlights, pushed through the initial thicket of brush and began their trek, aiming for the black wooded slope.\nFirst, the house painter: bearded, calm, quiet.\nSecond, the Catholic nun: gentle, grandmotherly, short of breath.\nThird, the drifter: alert, intense, shouldering supplies.\nThey crept across the marshy field, led by some combination of God and Google Maps. Behind them was the city of Oak Ridge, Tenn., 30 minutes west of Knoxville. On the other side of Pine Ridge was Bear Creek Valley  cradle of the Y-12 National Security Complex, the Fort Knox of Uranium, birthplace of the heart of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima 67 years earlier.\nIt was, the house painter would later recall, as if the Almighty were guiding each step, across 1,000 feet of open field and up an embankment.\nBy 3 a.m. on Saturday, July 28, 2012, two career peace activists, with eight years jail time between them, and an 82-year-old nun had reached the first obstacle in their two-hour, one-mile hike toward one of the countrys most secure nuclear facilities.\nA six-foot chain-link boundary fence bordered a gravel patrol road. Strung along the fence were yellow No Trespassing placards threatening a $100,000 fine and up to one year in prison.\nThe house painter gripped a pair of bolt cutters, fixed the jaws around a link and squeezed. He cut links in three lines, then opened the new flap.\nNo alarm. No patrol cars.\nThe nun went through first.\nAfter the two men followed her, they closed the fence with twine, crossed the patrol road and began the 40-degree ascent to the dark crest of the ridge. The crime had started, which meant they were one step closer to justice.\nOne step closer to rattling the Department of Energy.\nOne step closer to assailing the nations storied nuclear identity.\nOne step closer to changing their lives and the lives of the people on the other side of the slope  including the first man they would meet once they cut through three more fences and entered the kill zone.\nChapter 2\n and the earth will shake\nIn those same woods, around 1900, a middle-aged ascetic named John Hendrix gazed up at the sky and heard a voice like a clap of thunder.\nThe voice told Hendrix to sleep in the woods for 40 nights. So he did. And he had a vision of the future, according to The Oak Ridge Story, a 1950 book by George O. Robinson Jr.\nAnd I tell you, Hendrix said to his farming community after his retreat, Bear Creek Valley some day will be filled with great buildings and factories and they will help toward winning the greatest war that ever will be. . . . They will be building things and there will be great noise and confusion and the earth will shake.\nHendrix often summited Pine Ridge, Robinson wrote, to pray over the vista of peach orchards and log cabins.\nIve seen it, was his refrain. Its coming.\nOn Nov. 11, 1942, decades after Hendrixs death, a letter from the government arrived at the home of his son: The War Department intends to take possession of your farm Dec. 1, 1942. . . . Your fullest cooperation will be a material aid to the War Effort.\nThe government paid Curtis Allen Hendrix $850 for his 60-acre farm, which would be overtaken by the Manhattan Project, the countrys race to build an atomic bomb before Hitler did. Three thousand homesteaders were displaced by the government, which then built a city from scratch by laying 200 miles of road, constructing 44,000 dwelling units and importing 75,000 workers: steelmen from Pennsylvania, machinists and woodworkers from Michigan, riveters and physicists and stenographers and chemists from coast to coast. The 14-square-mile Secret City of Oak Ridge was forested with billboards that said Keep mum about this job and We will win in 44 with your help.\nScores of East Tennessee high school girls were trained to operate the dials on complex machinery at the Y-12 site. They didnt know that each flick of their wrists aided the gram-by-gram production of U-235, the uranium isotope that can sustain the chain reaction of fission necessary to create a nuclear explosion.\nThe science seems simple enough: When a neutron strikes the nucleus of a U-235 atom, the nucleus splits and releases thermal energy and more neutrons, which in turn strike and split more uranium nuclei, and on and on, in an instant, until . . .\nThe biggest boom, from the smallest of particles.\nAround the clock for 18 months, the Secret City hummed and hustled. Hendrix, his vision borne out, was posthumously deemed the Prophet of Oak Ridge. For most townspeople, the full nature of their mission became clear only in bold newspaper ink on Aug. 6, 1945.\nATOMIC SUPER-BOMB, MADE AT OAK RIDGE, STRIKES JAPAN, announced the Knoxville News-Sentinel.\nChapter 3\nSabotage\nIt was into this land and history that outsiders intruded 67 years later: Sister Megan Gillespie Rice, now 83; drifter Michael Robin Walli, now 64; and house painter Gregory Irwin Boertje-Obed, 57.\nThey, like Hendrix, had a vision.\nThey, like Hendrix, can come off a little batty.\nMichael, though fiercely intelligent, often departs on tirades about the Antichrist.\nSister Megan, adamant about not harming any living thing, vowed that if they were attacked by guard dogs inside the complex she would not even raise her hands in self-defense.\nGreg is so meek in demeanor that its hard to imagine him wielding cutlery, let alone bolt cutters.\nHendrix envisioned the improbable construction of a wartime city.\nMichael, Sister Megan and Greg envision its improbable dismantlement.\nWith elbow grease and blind faith, they would make a symbolic incursion to defeat the sites $150 million-a-year security operation. They would mortify the nations nuclear weapons programs, which since 1940 has cost at least $9.8 trillion in 2013 dollars  costlier than all other government expenditures except Social Security and non-nuclear defense programs, according to nuclear weapons policy analyst Stephen Schwartzs recent update of his 1998 Brookings Institution audit.\nIn short: Nuclear weapons have been the United States third-highest national priority since World War II, in terms of dollars, and we spend a fortune every year to manage and secure them. Yet a crucial facility in this nuclear enterprise wasnt even nun-proofed, much less terrorist-proofed, as a Tennessee congressman would put it in a February hearing on the break-in, which shut down Y-12 site operations for two weeks.\nThis is how Congress describes the intrusion and fallout: Embarrassing. Astonishing. Unprecedented.\nThis is how Greg, Michael and Sister Megan describe it: Gods will. Victory. A miracle. Another step toward the eradication of immoral weapons.\nWhen superimposed on the small-town history of Oak Ridge or the quotidian mechanics of federal Washington, their anti-nuclear beliefs can look heroic or treasonous. Nuclear bombs are existential weaponry. They ignite existential debates. Paradoxes proliferate. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, sometimes unclear at first.\nSometimes one must step away from lawfulness in the service of a greater good.\nSometimes the very thing that keeps us safe is the one thing that can exterminate us.\nSometimes we bargain over the lesser of two evils.\nWhat is unambiguous: The nun, the drifter and the house painter have been charged with two felonies whose combined maximum sentence is 30 years in prison. One of these felonies is rarely leveled against civilians: intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of the United States, as written under the Sabotage chapter of the U.S. Code.\nTheir jury trial is scheduled to begin May 7 in Knoxville.\nThe defendants do not view it as their trial, even though they proudly admit to trespassing and damaging government property. By exposing what they believe to be the fallacy of national security, by smuggling their anti-war message into the judicial system through the back door, they believe they are putting the country on trial.\nChapter 4\nThe summit\nThe nun plodded up the steep and densely wooded ridge.\nIn front of her was the painter, behind her the drifter and the boundary fence. Pathless, they snaked slowly in wide turns to ease the climb, pausing often so she could catch her breath.\nThe Holy Spirit directs a person to what is right and what is possible, the nun thought, and this was possible.\nHer parents taught her that life is about moving toward ones purpose. She had been working her way toward this climb since the age of 9, when she learned her familys next-door neighbor in New York City was a Columbia University biophysicist privy to the secret Manhattan project.\nShe remembers Pearl Harbor and covering her eyes when the newsreels played war footage before matinees at Trans-Lux movie theaters in Manhattan.\nShe remembers her obstetrician father, who spoke of impoverished patients at Bellevue Hospital; her mother, whose PhD thesis explored the Catholic opinion on slavery; and her uncle, Walter Hooke, a Marine who was yoked with the terrible weight of knowing after surveying the decimation of Nagasaki, where all that survived in the citys cathedral was a scorched wood statue of the Virgin Mary.\nShe remembers committing as a teenager to the teaching order Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus because of their work in Africa, and learning at Boston College how radioactivity affects human cells.\nThe servants of God stopped to rest.\nA dog barked in the distance. From town? From over the ridge?\nShe had known danger. Kneeling down to block traffic at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site in the 80s.\nShe had known hardship. Sleeping in classrooms in rural east Nigeria. No running water, no electricity.\nShe had known Sister Anne Montgomery, who, in 2009 at 83, broke into Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, which harbors nuclear submarines, and was convicted, with four others, of trespassing and damaging federal property.\nHow can I get involved? Sister Megan asked Sister Anne after the trial.\nCall Greg Boertje-Obed, Sister Anne said.\nAnd now there she was, an old lady in sturdy shoes, reaching the limits of her mortal energy at the top of Pine Ridge with Greg, about 90 minutes into the mission. There was the vista over which the Prophet of Oak Ridge had prayed more than a century before, where a national security complex now winked in the darkness.\nThere was still a slope to descend, and three more fences to cut through. The plan was to hike along the ridge, breach the fences away from the facilitys guard towers and then walk casually toward the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility, which houses the nations cache of highly enriched uranium  an estimated 400 tons of it, racked in cans floor-to-ceiling across 110,000 square feet.\nInside the building was enough radioactive material to fuel over 10,000 nuclear bombs, which would end civilization many times over.\nSister Megan was tired and fading with the night, so they recalibrated.\nThey started down the slope immediately.\nOnce clear of the trees, they would head for the first building they saw.\nChapter 5\nThe belly of the beast\nMission planning involved searching the Bible and the Internet.\nAll of the relevant information on Y-12s layout was available online. All of the relevant motivation was available in the books of Psalms, Proverbs and Isaiah.\nThe Y-12 break-in is the latest Plowshares disarmament action, a tradition of symbolic and intrepid civil resistance dating to September 1980, when the Berrigan brothers and six others hammered on Minutemen missiles and poured blood on documents at the General Electric weapons plant in King of Prussia, Pa. The Plowshares activists take their name and inspiration from Isaiah 2:4, a verse prophesying a world without war.\nA parade of actions, each with its own name, has followed over the years. The Dorothy Day Catholic Worker house in Petworth is home to several Plowshares alumni, including Michael, and a home away from home to Sister Megan, who resides in her orders residence on Newton Street NE. (Greg lives with his wife and daughter in Duluth, Minn.)\nIn the context of Plowshares history, the July action was both typical and astounding, says Paul Magno, a Plowshares veteran and a leader of D.C. nonprofit Witness for Peace.\nTo me, it goes to not only the over-hype, the over-sell of the whole security mythology, but it goes to what you can do with an act of faith, Magno says. Gods people can be faithful and the Red Sea parts and lets them through when theres no reason to believe that should be possible.\nThe action last summer was dubbed Transform Now Plowshares because its three participants desire the immediate conversion of all nuclear weaponry from agents of war to resources that benefit mankind.\nMichael and Sister Megan live in the world as they believe it should be, not in the world as it is.\nSister Megan doesnt vote.\nIt would mean I would be a citizen of this regime. I am a citizen of the world. I act in consequence.\nMichael derides Washington as the belly of the beast.\nDid you know that the last president who wasnt a war criminal was Herbert Hoover?\nSays Sister Megan of Michael: His mind is never still.\nSays Michael of Sister Megan: Shes a visionary.\nTogether theyre like an overactive younger brother and patient older sister. Michael summons the brimstone, Sister Megan the bromide.\nWhen she and Michael retell their story, which they do often to eager foot soldiers of social justice groups, they put it in tidy parable form on PowerPoint: We saw injustice at Y-12, so we broke in to bring truth and attract the worlds attention, and here is the U.S. governments seven-decade budget for nuclear-weapons infrastructure. After one such presentation, at the weekly Clarification of Thought at the Dorothy Day house, a visitor asks about the forces they faced once they made it through the final fence that summer night.\nThe first person to really lose his job was this lovely security guard, says Sister Megan, adding that she hopes to meet him when she, Greg and Michael go to Knoxville for a pre-trial hearing on whether they can offer moral conviction as a defense in court.\nChapter 6\nThe descent\nThe lights of the Antichrist flickered through the trees.\nThe drifter prayed.\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace. For all the glory is yours, and on the last day Jesus will come like this, like a thief in the night, and the warmongering United States will fulfill Isaiahs prophecy by beating its swords into plowshares.\nHe had duct-taped the head of his flashlight to reduce the beam to a sliver. On the downward slope of Pine Ridge, he moved in front of the nun, clearing branches and stones from her path. He was just a frail earthen vessel, he believed, but she was a daughter of God. He was her bodyguard.\nOn his head was a construction hat painted light blue, with UN marked on the front. On his breath was the stink of Top brand tobacco. In their backpacks, he and the nun carried twine, matches, candles, a Bible, three hammers, six cans of spray paint, three protest banners, copies of a letter they wished to deliver to Y-12 employees and two emblems of sustenance  a packet of cucumber seeds and a fresh-baked loaf of bread with a cross molded into the top.\nAnd six baby bottles of human blood.\nThis was easy compared with Vietnam, where he carried briefing boards of heavy hinged plywood out of Phuoc Long province during the Cambodia incursion. Michael was an Army specialist, an expert marksman with an M-14 and M-16. The carpet-bombing from American B-52s still echoes in his head.\nLike thunder, but it didnt stop.\nHe earned a Bronze Star.\nHe considers himself a war criminal.\nHe left the Army after two tours, found Jesus, became an ascetic, worked in a homeless shelter in Chicago, stormed the gates of the CIA with 1,500 other activists in April 1987, wound up in Fairfax Countys jail and decided to stay in Washington upon his release.\nAnd now, 45 years after his enlistment, he was at the edge of the woods on the other side of Pine Ridge, the flood-lit expanse of Y-12 in front of him.\nAs predicted long ago, the valley was filled with great buildings, many rusted and dating to the Manhattan Project. But right in front of them was a vast, new fortress of reinforced concrete with a foundation anchored in bedrock.\nAs luck, or providence, would have it, this was their original target: the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility, a large part of Y-12s mission to reduce its physical footprint, improve its safety and modernize its operations.\nFrom the treeline, they watched a patrol SUV pass one way on Bear Creek Road, then the other. Then they walked across the two lanes and approached the first of three eight-foot chain-link fences. This outer fence, with three lines of barbed wire on top, was part of Y-12s perimeter intrusion detection and assessment system.\nIt was no match for bolt cutters.\nThe house painter began cutting links in the first fence near a sign that said Danger: Halt! Deadly force is authorized beyond this point.\nSomewhere on the site, according to the Knoxville News-Sentinels nuclear reporter Frank Munger, were Gatling guns capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute  a fusillade that could reduce a trespasser to pink mist.\nThe painter pulled back the flap of chain links like a curtain.\nThe nun entered the kill zone first.\nChapter 7\nThe Secret City\nNestled in a river valley, Oak Ridge looks unremarkable on the surface. Its old town square has been overtaken by a congested turnpike lined with fast food joints, credit unions and parking lots. Cul-de-sacs of single-family homes unfurl up the foggy foothills of the Smoky Mountains.\nRoads are named Hickory, Poplar and Whippoorwill, and Manhattan, Palladium and Boeing. Flagpoles clang. The Panera is always packed. Locals pronounce their city Oh-kridge.\nOn a knoll on the front lawn of St. Marys Catholic Church, a six-foot marble statue of the Virgin Mary gazes southward over the low-rise downtown, toward Pine Ridge. Her face shaded by dark green mold, the Virgin stands barefoot on a spheroid plinth that represents Earth. This Mary, like most Marys, has her foot on a serpent, but theres a curious non-biblical icon on the Earth under her toes: a nucleus framed by a whirl of electrons.\nThe atomic symbol is on the facade of the public high school. It is rendered in stained glass inside the public library. It is on the big green sign that heralds the Y-12 National Security Complex just over Pine Ridge.\nAt noon on the first Wednesday of every month, the DOE tests its public-warning sirens for three minutes. Every June, reenactors stage the Allied invasion of Normandy in the town park.\nThough you havent needed a badge to get into the town since 1949, Oak Ridges soul hasnt changed. Its still a company town, and the company is the government, and the business is bombs.\nIts centerpiece, Y-12, has become a large processing shop and warehouse for most of the countrys highly enriched uranium. Its one of five production sites connected to three research labs under the umbrella of the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semi-autonomous entity within the Department of Energy created in the year 2000 to manage and secure nuclear weapons and non-proliferation programs.\nY-12 processes highly enriched uranium for a variety of purposes, including life-extension programs for three classes of warheads and the B61 bomb. The renovation of these weapons programs could take 25 years, officials estimate, and cost $20 billion. The site also dismantles weapons components and downblends the highly enriched uranium, reducing its radioactivity for use in research and nuclear reactors.\nWeapons, war and secrecy are the citys economy, its legacy and, for now, its future. Concrete guard stations from the early 1950s lurk on the roadsides. A commemorative walk salutes the 43ers  those thousands of people who moved to Oak Ridge at the governments behest in 1943. One plaque says residents work made possible a weapon that was instrumental in bringing peace to a world anguished by the brutal six-year war in which 54 million people died.\nThe activists of Transform Now Plowshares are in West Knoxville in early February, at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, testifying to the congregation after a Sunday service. Church members ask them how they can claim nonviolence when they destroyed property.\nMaybe the triviality of that destruction comes from a truth that is monstrous, Sister Megan says. Those very fences are illegal, and guarding lies and secrecy and corruption and great danger to the world.\nWhite-haired Lillian Mashburn stands, arms crossed, in the back of the church. Shes thinking of her father, who was an infantryman stationed in the Pacific when Oak Ridges uranium fell toward Hiroshima.\nHe was saved by that bomb, Mashburn, a church board member, says after the discussion. They were told when they landed they would be killed as part of the first wave. . . . Theres a whole generation of people, most of whom wouldve been dead, who were saved.\nWhat saves Oak Ridge are the dollars that gush from Washington to East Tennessee.\nThe complex is the second-largest employer in East Tennessee and creates 24,000 indirect jobs, according to the site contractors Y-12 Community Relations Council. Eight thousand people go to work there, including contractors, subcontractors, protective-force guards and 80 federal employees of the Department of Energy. For 2014, $1.2 billion was requested by the NNSA for the management and operation of Y-12.\nY-12 is slated to construct a new Uranium Processing Facility, a massive building that will ensure that Americas nuclear arsenal remains operational. Peak construction of the UPF will create 1,500 construction jobs and 5,000 support jobs.\nThis community serves the DOE, says Ralph Hutchison, 56, the coordinator of the nonprofit Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, whose ultimate goal is to abolish nuclear weapons, which means halting operations at Y-12. Its the environment in which they live. Its the air they breathe.\nChapter 8\nThe miracle\nThe trio stood in a moat of white rocks between the first and second fence.\nThe complex was lit bright as day.\nNo one was racing to apprehend them.\nThe middle fence was intimidating, and wired for something.\nMotion sensoring?\nElectricity?\nThis is not going to work, the house painter thought. We are not going to get through this.\nHe had known doubt before. Greg was a Presbyterian Iowa farm boy who joined the ROTC to afford Tulane University. He went into active duty at Fort Polk in 1981, as the nuclear-freeze movement rallied against President Ronald Reagans stockpile buildup. He read Daniel Berrigan.\nHis government said: Be ready for nuclear war.\nThe prophet Isaiah said: Do not put your trust in horses and chariots.\nHe couldnt reconcile the two. He left the Army as a conscientious objector, he says, and returned to New Orleans in time to hear Berrigan talk about Plowshares actions.\nGreg heard an inner voice say, Go in this direction.\nWithin two years, he was living at Jonah House, the Catholic Worker residence in Baltimore, where he met his wife, Michele. While raising their daughter, they scheduled their protests to make sure that only one of them was facing jail at any given time. His first action was hammering Trident II missile tubes at Quonset Point shipyard in Rhode Island.\nTwenty-six years later, a nun would call him up, looking to make her own first action.\nAnd now this middle fence, and the possibility that their mission was over. Surely security cameras had spied them by now. Surely this fence would trip an alarm.\nYou wont know unless you try, the inner voice told him.\nHe began cutting links in the middle fence, severing fiber-optic sensors.\nNo one came for them.\nThis is grace, he thought, and he climbed through after the others.\nHe cut through the last fence, and they were through the Red Sea, and there was nothing between them and the Fort Knox of Uranium.\nGod is with us, he thought. This is a miracle.\nThey shook cans of red and black spray paint.\nThey gripped the baby bottles of blood.\nThey spray painted the buildings north wall, which was designed to withstand the impact of aircraft but not the words of the Book of Proverbs. They poured and splashed blood that had once been in the veins of a painter-activist named Tom Lewis, one of the Catonsville Nine who, on Hiroshima Day 1987, hammered on the bomb racks of an anti-submarine plane at the South Weymouth Naval Air Station near Boston. In 2008, Lewis died in his sleep, and his blood was frozen so that he might one day participate in one last Plowshares action.\nIn bright red rivulets, the last of Tom Lewis streaked down the concrete.\nThey removed the hammers from the drifters backpack. TRANSFORM NOW was written in red marker on the handle of the claw hammer. Burned into the handle of the small sledge hammer was Repent! Gods kingdom is at hand!\nThey began to strike the pentagonal base of a guard tower at the northwest corner of the building. Chips of concrete fell to the asphalt. Blood dribbled into the scar.\nThey believed they were also hammering on what had not yet been built. The wide open space to the right of the tower was designated for the Uranium Processing Facility, now projected to cost at least $6.5 billion, a stockpile of money that they wanted spent on life-extension programs for people.\nThey rang their hammers down on the senselessness of it all.\nThey waited to be arrested.\nIn a matter of minutes, a single guard would be sent to investigate.\nChapter 9\nThe quantum theory of physics\nGreg is prepping baked potatoes.\nSister Megan is setting silverware.\nMichael is carrying armloads of firewood in from outside.\nThey are gathering for a dinner of salmon, tofu and broccoli with a couple of other members of the Transform Now Plowshares support group at a supporters house in south Knoxville. From this home base, in the days before their February pretrial hearing, they bring their anti-bomb evangel to various settings.\nAt the University of Tennessee, where they are guest speakers in a systems theory class, Greg talks about the diffusion of social responsibility and how he feels personally responsible for nuclear weapons because his taxes have paid for them. Michael, who is wearing a T-shirt that says GROUND THE DRONES, calls Y-12 a failed rogue terrorist state.\nI think theres a deafening silence about whats going on at Y-12, says student Rochelle Butler, but I do know people who work there are good people. Why would I believe outsiders rather than people who work there, who I believe to be good?\nWe love these people in a deeply compassionate way, Sister Megan says of the Y-12 employees. Our motivation was in solidarity with people who spend their time making nuclear bombs to feed their children. . . . We are all so intertwined and empower each other. A thought creates its own energy. The quantum theory of physics is always at work.\nThe theory is at work a couple of days later at Maryville College, where the trio eats pizza with 15 students from a progressive Christian group. They are each connected to 50 others, Sister Megan whispers before chatting with music student Chris Hickman.\nI know nothing about the anti-nuclear movement, Hickman tells her. I was born in 92, and its kind of an afterthought for my generation.\nGreg, Michael and Sister Megan visit with two dozen people at a meeting of the Presbyterian Peacemaking Committee of East Tennessee.\nPrince of Peace, we thank you for your prophets whove spoken your word down through the ages, and we thank you for the prophets among us, says host Scott Brunger during his opening prayer.\nThe attendees chat about the fallout from the break-in. Someone asks about what their intrusion has cost taxpayers  at least $15 million in security alterations by the NNSA, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel  and Greg says that they saved taxpayers $12.2 million that was docked from the management contractors award fee. Sister Megan again brings up the first guard they encountered inside the facility and how he lost his job. She says how he saved their lives by not escalating the situation.\nI feel very guilty not contacting him, Sister Megan admits.\nThe guards number is listed.\nHell answer the phone if you call.\nAnd when you ask about the three people who broke into Y-12 last summer, you can almost hear his grip on the phone tighten as he says: You mean the people who ruined my life?\nChapter 10\nIve served my country\nTwo weeks after the break-in, Kirk Garland was handed a letter from the sites protective-force contractor that said he failed in his responsibilities as a guard on the morning of July 28, 2012. The letter said he showed blatant disregard for the seriousness of the situation. It said he was terminated, effective immediately, and his health insurance would expire two days later.\nA solid man with a cinnamon-colored mustache, Kirk started working in nuclear security in 1983 at Colorados now-shuttered Rocky Flats Plant, which processed plutonium for weapons. For three years, he worked in a similar job at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Tex., where nuclear weapons are put together and taken apart. Then he moved to Y-12, where the fuel is processed.\nWhat Oak Ridge built, he says, he was proud to protect.\nIn my eyes, after being a guard for 30 years, I feel that I should be treated the same way as somebody who served in Iraq, says Kirk, 52. Ive served my country for 30 years by protecting my nations nuclear assets.\nHe was four years from retirement, bringing home $85,000 a year with overtime, with a pristine employment record.\nThe sign on the front door of his modest house says, This property has been determined to be vacant and abandoned. He could rescue it from foreclosure, but doesnt have the money. What he has is a rental home in nearby Clinton, a sick wife, a months worth of losing lottery tickets, a 16-year-old daughter who has curtailed her passion for barrel-racing horses, and a small contingent of German shepherds that he raises to sell to police department K-9 units.\nI do okay, he says, standing in the ransacked backyard of his former home in Lake City, Tenn. My wife dont. She cant come up here. Nothing I can do about it. Thirty years with DOE. And youre looking at everything.\nScattered cinder blocks. Sodden heaps of pink insulation. The kennel hauled off by vandals, the small stable stripped of its roof and most of its siding. It had been a good life in Lake City, 20 miles north of Y-12, where he worked for nearly 5 1/2 years until those people, he says, decided to overexert their First Amendment right.\nThe report on the break-in by the inspector general of the Department of Energy faults Kirk for not pulling his weapon, for not securing the area.\nThe sites management contractor, Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services Y-12, faults him for not immobilizing the intruders and for turning his back while they rummaged through their backpacks.\nThe sites protective-force contractor, WSI-Oak Ridge, faults him for an embarrassing and casual response to the intrusion. NNSA officials were horrified by surveillance video of Kirk first addressing the intruders from his car, instead of immediately jumping out, and for making assumptions about their intent.\nIf he had acted too aggressively, on the other hand, Y-12 might have had a dead nun on its hands.\nKirk says there was no reason to unholster his gun, that it was unsafe for one man to try to cuff three people, that an entire patrol team shouldve been dispatched to a zone with multiple alarms. He had previously dealt with peace protesters at Rocky Flats, which is how he knew that the three trespassers were not dangerous, he says. The blatant disregard, he says, lies elsewhere.\nIn fact, the security camera that watched Zone 63, the area of the trios incursion, had been out of service for six months, according to a subsequent report from the Department of Energys inspector general. At the time of the break-in, there were 56 busted security tools across Y-12, seven broken security cameras surrounding the HEUMF and an average of 2,170 sitewide alarms per day  many caused by wildlife, weather and foliage.\nNone of this was Kirks responsibility.\nIn my eyes theyve ruined my name, Kirk says of the government and its contractors. I worked hard. I mean, I put my family second a lot of times to keep this clearance for 30 years, just to have it jerked out from me like that. . . . I think they were embarrassed that an 82-year-old got in that far. And they used me for their scapegoat. They used me to say, Well, he messed it up. We got rid of him. But I wasnt the problem.\nThe problem, according to a string of reports over the years from the DOEs inspector general and the Government Accountability Office, was a lax security culture and hands-off federal oversight. The problem was a culture of compliance, as opposed to a culture of performance, according to a B&W Y-12s post-mortem of what became known internally as the Security Event. A GAO report released, coincidentally, three days after the break-in admonished the NNSA for cost overruns, mismanagement and an absentee relationship with contractors.\nTo date, Kirk is the only individual to have been fired outright because of the incident. The guards who failed to detect and initiate a proper response to the breach were suspended, and the supervising lieutenant was disciplined. B&W Y-12 removed four managers, allowing the top two to formally retire. Four federal officials with security oversight jobs were reassigned. The leaders of the guard force retired or were reassigned, says Paul Donahue, chief executive of G4S Government Solutions, the parent company of the protective force company, which lost its contract. The management and operations contractor lost $12.2 million of its award incentive fee, and the same firms, with different partners, have bid on a new 10-year contract for both Y-12 and Pantex worth $23 billion.\nKirk has a car repairman dogging him for a $1,000 debt that he cant pay. In March, he took a guard job at a county jail that he says pays $24,000 a year. His case is slated for arbitration this fall through the International Guards Union of America.\nHes reached for his Baptist faith to temper his anger. He attends services at Faith Promise, a massive church on a hill on the outskirts of Oak Ridge. He doesnt understand how law-breaking activists can be inspired by the same God that guides his life down the straight and narrow.\nIve got to sit down and ask a priest, Kirk says. Doing the Lords work is not protesting and getting arrested. You dont get to heaven on your works anyway. You get to heaven on salvation. . . . Gods got a different plan for me. Everything happens in his timing, whenever hes ready to move us along.\nWhen told that Sister Megan thinks he saved her life by not escalating the situation  that, in fact, he was her salvation  Kirk is speechless. His wife is not.\nThats amazing that shed make that kind of statement, scoffs Joann Garland. She is safe  because of him  to be able to go and do what shes doing. . . . The joke of it is they came in Gods name. God does not say to break laws. Sorry. God does not say that.\nChapter 11\nScales of justice\nIf religion gives meaning to the chaos of the cosmos, the law developed alongside to order societys unruliest parts.\nGreg, who represents himself in court, stood behind the microphone and delivered his testimony in monolithic terms.\nSo when you build a nuclear weapon, you are planning and preparing to commit mass murder, he argued in a November pre-trial hearing in Knoxville. You are giving your assent to the killing of civilians.\nIn that precursor episode to The United States of America v. Walli et al, the defense argued that it is illegal for the United States to possess nuclear weapons because their sole purpose is to inflict damage that cannot be contained: Civilians perish en masse, the environment is poisoned for generations and the mere threat of this scenario  even under the guise of deterrence  constitutes imminent harm that cannot be ignored for one more minute, let alone successive generations.\nAfter the defense cited the Geneva and Hague conventions and invoked the Nuremberg principles, the government argued that international treaties do not take precedence over laws Congress enacts to ensure national defense, including nuclear weapons programs. At the notion of complicity to war crimes, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey E. Theodore balked.\nThey say if they didnt act, that they are somehow complicit in this illegality, Theodore argued in November. Well, then, therefore, all the people here who have not acted, not [broken] in to Y-12 to stop the illegal operations there, then . . . theyre complicit in war crimes, I guess, which is . . . a ludicrous argument.\nWilliam Quigley, the defendants pro-bono counsel, told the court his clients should be allowed to testify about their moral imperatives for the break-in.\nThe effort to preclude necessity, international law, nuclear policy, God, conscience, history, who knows the other things  I think its, its inconsistent with our search, our mutual search for the truth, Quigley said.\nAfter Michael, Greg and Sister Megan refused a plea bargain, the government hit them with the more serious charge under the sabotage act. That led Transform Now Plowshares and its support group to Courtroom 3B of U.S. District Court in downtown Knoxville in Feburary, for a second hearing on obstructing the national defense, scheduled between a case of bank robbery and a case of Social Security fraud.\nThat morning, Sister Megan has trouble getting through security.\nAny metal on you, sister? a guard asks during her third run through the metal detector.\nI have titanium in my wrists, the nun says, then gestures to the X-ray machine. Do you wear lead vests standing next to this all day? I think you should.\nThe support group swells to 25 people and fills all rows on the defenses side of the courtroom. Ralph Hutchison and folks from the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance are here.\nAs they await the start of the hearing, the supporters begin singing softly.\nPeace is flo-wing like a riiiii-ver, they warble from their seats. Flo-wing out into the deeeeesert.\nHutchison chuckles. Oh the judge loves it when they sing, he says.\nChapter 12\nReaction\nIn Washington, a congressman asks the nun to please stand up.\nWe want to thank you for pointing out some of the problems in our security, says Rep. Joe L. Barton (R-Tex.).\nAnother congressman expresses a different kind of gratitude.\nThank you for your willingness to focus attention on this nuclear weapons buildup that still exists in our world, says Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and how much we need to do something to reduce it.\nA third congressman is incredulous at the nuns mere presence at this September oversight hearing of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\nWhy are they even here in this hearing room? says Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.). Why are they not being held in  in detention somewhere?\nSince July 28, Congress has been sputtering with indignation. Hearings were scheduled on Sept. 12 and 13, Feb. 28 and March 13 so legislators could vocalize how shocked and appalled they are. The phrase wake-up call is uttered and re-uttered. Peace through strength becomes a refrain. The word culture is used 72 times to explain how a complex, highly funded operation could be so vulnerable. Federal officials at the witness table get lost in a maze of their own jargon. Congress members wonder over and over what would have happened if the intruders had been terrorists, not peace activists. Brig. Gen. Sandra Finan, commander of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, appears several times to present her task forces findings on Lessons of the Y-12 Security Failure: NNSA has muddled lines of authority, and its security culture has focused on fiscal limitations over effective performance.\nSister Megan and Michael witness each hearing in sweat pants and parkas. They are lost in the navy thicket of young legislative assistants. On one of these field trips, they get off the Metro at Capitol South station and grimace at the giant Raytheon ads that feature military vehicles and mottos like Any threat, any mission.\nOn Feb. 28, the House Armed Services Committees subcommittee on strategic forces tries to sniff out blame.\nAnd as the chairman correctly pointed out, says Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) at one point, its hard to find that anybody was punished except the lowest-level guard.\nAt a break, Sister Megan approaches one of the expert witnesses, retired Maj. Gen. C. Donald Alston, the former Air Force assistant chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration.\nIll give this to you, she says, handing him a folded sheet of white paper. Its a letter calling for the immediate suspension of funding for the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12.\nThe whole thing can be solved by changing the mission, Sister Megan says to the major general. Change the mission, brother.\nWe have a lot of stability in the world because of nuclear weapons, says Alston, smiling, towering over her in uniform.\nIts impossible to even secure one, Sister Megan says. We can change the mission. Its possible.\nOkay, he says.\nWe can have projects that sustain humanity.\nOkay, he says, starting to leave the witness table.\nThis is the nun, Michael says, coming to her side.\nOh, Alston says, before turning away.\nSister Megan is not concerned with this slight. The world needs positive and negative charges, she says. You cant have energy without both.\nOn March 13, during a second hearing in front of the Energy and Commerces oversight subcommittee, Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) cites a 2010 Department of Energy memo in which Deputy Secretary Daniel B. Poneman called for the elimination of excessive Federal oversight of contractors and the awarding of decision-making authorities to the lowest level of contractor and Federal management.\nThe subcommittee, as a body, wonders if the department had farmed out the stewardship of nuclear assets to contractors who self-police and self-appraise, and therefore continue to collect fees while cutting corners.\nWhat we were trying to do, sir, was to get rid of the check-box mentality of just looking at paperwork and creating paperwork, Poneman replies. To get back to performance testing so we could be better, safer and more secure.\nSitting just over Ponemans shoulder at each one of these hearings are two of the people who have put him on this hot seat for the past eight months.\nI appreciate what you did, a staffer for the Government Accountability Office tells Sister Megan after the hearing adjourns. But dont do it again, because I dont want you to get hurt.\nChapter 13\nA sheet of sun\nThe last shipment of highly enriched uranium bound for Japan left Oak Ridge on July 25, 1945, and arrived two days later on the island of Tinian in the oblivion of the Pacific Ocean. On Aug. 6, a 9,700-pound, 10-foot-long atomic bomb was loaded onto a B-29 bomber, flown 1,500 miles northwest, and dropped over Hiroshima.\nEyes melted from the heads of those who had been looking skyward at the sheet of sun, as John Herseys Hiroshima described the light of the explosion.\nSome 160,000 were dead, dying or injured.\nFive square miles burned.\nA harnessing of the basic power of the universe, President Harry Truman announced.\nOne of the greatest blunders of history, wrote physicist Leo Szilard, an architect of the Manhattan Project.\nWAR ENDS, The Knoxville Journal declared.\nOur national complex was just beginning. The bomb created to stop one war imbued all future wars with apocalyptic power. The United States raced Russia to amass nuclear weapons  a peak of 30,000 stateside in the mid-1960s  then began to reduce the stockpile as other nations pursued and attained nuclear capability.\nThis past January, the Indian government distributed to Kashmiris a nuclear-war advisory that encouraged the building of bunkers.\nIn March, Secretary of State John F. Kerry told ABC News that confrontation becomes more possible if Iran continues its plan to enrich uranium and develop nuclear weaponry.\nIn April, North Korea publicized its desire to strike the United States, and the White House announced that it had helped the Czech Republic remove its entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium  all 150 pounds of it, or enough for two or three nukes.\nThe United States possesses roughly 4,650 active nuclear weapons plus another 3,000 awaiting dismantlement, according to the Federation of American Scientists, a non-partisan think tank created by Manhattan Project scientists. To satisfy the New START Treaty with Russia, our 1,950 strategically deployed high-alert nuclear weapons must be reduced to 1,550 by 2018. In order to get the treaty ratified by the Senate in 2010, President Obama promised $85 billion through 2020 for modernizing the U.S. stockpile.\nIn a time of austerity, our weapons budget is rising as our stockpile is falling.\nThe officials who lay awake at night worrying how to safeguard Cold War leftovers have a delicate, intricate mission fraught with peril and obstacle.\nWe have been running a system a certain way for such a long time and not really thinking about whether it was working or not, says acting NNSA administrator Neile Miller, charged with overseeing the politically choreographed  and therefore incremental  transition from proliferation to disarmament.\nMiller, during an interview in April at the DOE, acknowledges failures in management and says she understands the protester mentality and frustration. But the wish for a nuclear-free world of the future, she says, can distort perception of the policy that guides the world of the present.\nI know people want to believe that everybody here is just of one mind . . . and were all somehow of this military-industrial complex  and it just doesnt work that way, she says.  . . . People tend to be religiously for or religiously against. And as a result, they tend to attribute motivations and actions to all sorts of things that, in my personal experience, so very rarely turn out to be anywhere near whats actually happening.\nOur very national position on nuclear weapons, though, is a paradox.\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, says the administrations 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, the United States will sustain safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces.\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, Sister Megan, Michael, Greg and their fellow activists will hammer on their infrastructure. Incrementalism is the danger, they believe, because the threat is imminent, the consequences are catastrophic and society suffers financially and morally.\nAnd what if these backpack-wearing peaceniks had been terrorists, for whom obtaining highly enriched uranium is the likeliest way to create mass destruction?\nWith those 20 minutes of uninterrupted access to the site, they could have blown through the doors or walls of the HEUMF with an explosively formed penetrator and rigged an improvised nuclear device using highly enriched uranium and conventional explosives. A 10-kiloton detonation at Y-12 would cause an estimated 60,000 casualties, including 18,000 deaths, in East Tennessee. Radiation would have sickened people over 40 miles.\nThis worst-case scenario is presented in a yet-to-be-published report on UPF by the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, which combines a design basis threat scenario from the Department of Energy with a Department of Defense hazard-prediction algorithm employed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit.\nNNSA officials, noting classified security measures inside HEUMF, call this worst-case scenario very, very far-fetched.\nBut then so is a nun breaking into the Fort Knox of Uranium.\nThe intruders who werent terrorists admit to their actions.\nThe legislators have thanked them for initiating security reforms.\nThe deputy secretary of the Department of Energy said in February  during the Nuclear Deterrence Summit in Arlington  that the intrusion, while unacceptable, did not compromise the uranium and therefore did not directly imperil the nation.\nThe Justice Department has charged the trio with intending to do just that.\nSo what is really on trial the second week of May?\nThe limits of the judicial system, or the limits of social-justice actions?\nThe moral arch of the universe versus the bottom line of governance?\nIs it the bargain we strike with ourselves?\nChapter 14\nFission\nIn the late afternoon of Friday, July 27, 2012, the guard drove to Y-12, put on his camouflage uniform, embroidered with Semper Vigil, and holstered a Sig P226 9 mm on his hip.\nOver his 12-hour shift, day became night.\nFor his last two hours, 4 to 6 a.m., he rotated into a patrol vehicle. Around 4:20 a.m., a three-second tone came over his radio  a low-priority alarm that was cleared by an officer in short order. Soon after, the guards cellphone rang.\nThe cleared alarm keeps bouncing back, his supervising lieutenant said; the alarm station was suggesting something is not right in Zone 63, and that a maintenance crew might be at work. The guard was then dispatched to a sector of the security fence that runs around the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility. He arrived there in less than a minute and pulled slowly to the fence in his vehicle. Nothing seemed amiss, until movement caught his eye. He turned his head away from the fence to the HEUMF.\nAn old woman was walking toward his vehicle, a grizzled man on either side. At first he thought it was a painting crew  it wasnt uncommon for maintenance to be done overnight  but behind them were three phrases spray-painted red and black onto the white building.\nTHE FRUIT OF JUSTICE IS PEACE.\nPLOWSHARES PLEASE ISAIAH.\nWOE TO AN EMPIRE OF BLOOD.\nTheir hands were up.\nPeace protesters, he thought, as his phone rang again.\nIt was his lieutenant, checking in.\nIve got three individuals here who have appeared to have breached our system, the guard told him, and theyve written graffiti all over the walls.\nHis lieutenant thought he was kidding.\nIm telling you what I got. Theyre peace protesters. I need backup.\nHe then identified himself through the vehicle window and asked the trio: What are you doing here?\nGod led us here, said one of the men.\nStop where youre at, the guard said, exiting his vehicle.\nThe old woman bowed to him.\nKeep your hands where I can see them.\nWill you listen to our message? she said.\nThe three began to recite text from a white piece of paper.\nBrothers and sisters, powers that be, we come to you today as friends . . .\nThe two men retrieved candles from their backpacks nearby and lit them.\nA loving and compassionate creator invites us to take the urgent and decisive steps to transform the U.S. empire, and this facility, into life-giving alternatives which resolve real problems . . .\nIt would be five minutes before another security officer would show up, brandishing an M-16, ready to help cuff the intruders on the ground as they sang This Little Light of Mine. It would be another two hours until special agents from the Department of Energy arrested the trespassers and mobilized the wheels of justice, and six hours until the trespassers were booked in the Blount County Jail, and one day until the biblical graffiti was scrubbed clean, and 10 days until the three were charged with maliciously attempting to destroy a structure within the Y-12 National Security Complex, and two weeks until the complex reopened and the guard lost his job, and nine months until the trespassers would face trial before a jury of their fellow citizens that would have the power to convict them of intending to endanger the United States.\nBut for those next five minutes the scene was simple, almost sacramental.\nFour servants of God, drawn together by conviction and coincidence, regarded each other as dawn approached.\nThe Lord may have been there.\nThe devil, too.\nOr maybe human beings colliding in the quantum theory of physics was almighty enough.\nChapter 15\nThe Judgment\nNine men and three women step into the jury box, take their seats and face the three defendants. The jurors among them an engineer, a nurse, a social worker, a bus driver and a teacher  had deliberated for just under 2 1/2 hours on May 8, 2013, after hearing two days of testimony and arguments at U.S. District Court in downtown Knoxville, Tenn.\nThey had heard two assistant U.S. attorneys argue that the defendants targeted and intruded onto the nuclear weapons production facility in Oak Ridge in order to disrupt its operations and that such a disruption imperiled national security, which relies on the safety and readiness of the nuclear arsenal.\nThey had heard three defense attorneys argue that their clients never expected to make it as far as they did, that their goal was to promote the cause of disarmament through symbolic action and that their peaceful intrusion actually improved national security by exposing deficiencies at the Y-12 National Security Complex.\nSilent and rapt, supporters of the defendants had watched the proceedings from spectator seating and from an overflow courtroom equipped with a video feed.\nThe day before, the government had called as a witness the man who first encountered the defendants on site.\nWere they passive? defense attorney Christopher Irwin asked during cross-examination.\nThey were passive, Kirk Garland said.\nThe government had also called the top local official for the National Nuclear Security Administration, Steven Erhart, who was used by the attorneys to litigate the final actions of World War II and their reverberating consequences.\nYoud agree that the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed tens of thousands? defense attorney William Quigley had asked Erhart.\nYes, sir, Erhart replied.\nThe same thing would happen if they were dropped on a civilian center here, said Quigley, attempting to set the defendants actions against an infinitely more destructive hypothetical.\nIf used in that manner, yes, sir, Erhart said.\nAfter a lunch break, assistant U.S. attorney Melissa Kirby asked Erhart: What event ended World War II?\nThe events we talked about earlier, Erhart said. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nAnd how many American lives were saved by those events? Kirby asked, prompting murmurs from the courtroom audience.\nIve heard . . . \nObjection, said Francis Lloyd Jr., attorney for the nun. Speculation.\nOn the second day of trial, the defendants each took the stand.\nThe government asked: Do you consider yourself an American?\nThe nun said: I consider myself a citizen of the world.\nThe government asked: Do you believe the United States should disarm even if other countries do not?\nThe house painter said: I believe the U.S. should follow the treaties it has signed.\nThe government asked: Have you ever protested nuclear weapons programs in other countries, like China and Russia?\nThe drifter said: I am indigent, and I blossom where I was planted.\nAt nearly the exact same time that exact same day, on Capitol Hill, the acting administrator of the NNSA called the Y-12 intrusion an important wake-up call.\nThe severity of the failure of leadership at Y-12 has demanded swift, strong and decisive action by the department, Neile Miller told a Senate subcommittee during a hearing on strategic forces. Since the Y-12 incursion, major actions have taken place to improve security immediately, and for the long term.\nSoon after, back in Knoxville, closing arguments began.\nThe government said a shipment of important materials  due at Y-12 the day of the break-in  had to be diverted because of the site closure.\nThe defense attorneys said this secret shipment was a red herring, that their clients were scapegoats for embarrassed officials and greedy contractors.\nTheir whole mission here is to eradicate nuclear weapons, assistant U.S. attorney Jeffrey Theodore told the jury, and the nuclear deterrent is an integral part of our national defense.  Do you excuse what a burglar did because the homeowner was a little lax with security?\nThree senior citizens showing up with backpacks is a threat to the United States of America? defense attorney William Quigley asked rhetorically. That threatens us? I dont think so.  Getting rid of nuclear weapons does not equal an attack on the national defense of the United States.\nWhen the jury retired to deliberate at 3:30 p.m., the defendants and dozens of their supporters gathered in a tight circle in the hallway outside the courtroom.\nPeace is flowing like a river, they sang. In subsequent verses, they substituted truth for peace, then love for truth, then hope for love.\nI thought this was a courthouse, not a church, a nearby bailiff said to himself.\nThen, just before 6 p.m., as the defendants rise to face the jury of their peers, the foreman hands a single sheet of paper to the clerk, who hands it to Judge Amul Thapar, who announces the verdict: Guilty on all counts.\nThe nuns smiling expression does not change. She turns her palms upward, as if to say, This is what will be.\nAs the jury exits the courtroom, single file, supporters sing softly toward them: Love, love, love, love. People, we are made for love.\nAs the defendants are led, one after the other, out a rear door into custody to await a September sentencing of up to 30 years in prison, supporters wipe away tears and call out their gratitude.\nThe drifter is handcuffed  Thank you, Michael!  and then is gone.\nThe house painter gives a wave  Thank you, Greg!  and then is gone.\nThe nun blows a kiss  Thank you, Megan!  and then is gone.\nEpilogue: The prophets are sentenced, the guard declares bankruptcy\nAbout this story. The intrusion at Y-12 in Tennessee was re-created for this article through reporting in the city of Oak Ridge, extensive interviews with the three activists and former protective-force guard Kirk Garland, and interviews with federal officials and site employees. This account also draws upon congressional testimony and detailed written reports on the security event from the inspector general of the Department of Energy and the contractor partnership Babcock & Wilcox Technical Services Y-12.\nRelated Links\nEditors Picks",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows a high confidence (8) that the caption aligns with the image context, suggesting the image depicts children in Oak Ridge, Tennessee celebrating the end of WWII. However, the external check has low confidence (3) and cannot verify this claim, as the related article focuses on a different event unrelated to the image.  The discrepancy lies in the lack of direct corroborating evidence from external sources to confirm the location and event depicted in the image. While the internal assessment makes a reasonable inference based on the image's content, it cannot be definitively confirmed without additional verifiable information linking the photograph to Oak Ridge, Tennessee and the end of WWII. The internal assessment suggests a plausible scenario, but this is not enough to overcome the lack of external verification. Therefore, considering both checks, we conclude that the caption is likely out of context due to insufficient external evidence. The overall confidence score reflects the uncertainty arising from this lack of external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check suggests a strong alignment between the caption and image context, while the external check cannot verify the claim due to lack of corroborating evidence.

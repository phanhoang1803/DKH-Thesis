        "content": "REMSEN, Iowa  As the polka band played and the volunteers started serving the bratwurst, word slowly rippled through the annual Oktoberfest in this remote Iowa farm town: Eleven Jews had been massacred in Pittsburgh, gunned down at their synagogue.\nHatred, Iowans gathered for the celebration said. Sad. Awful. Makes me sick.\nNo one questioned whether their well-liked representative, Steve King  the U.S. congressman most openly affiliated with white nationalism  might be contributing to anti-Semitism or racism through his unapologetic embrace of white nationalist rhetoric and his praise of far-right politicians and groups in other nations.\nTheres still groups out there that praise Hitler and believe everything he taught. . . . A lot of that is going to get misconstrued, said Joe Schuttpelz. If Kings goal is defending the status of native-born Americans as immigrants move in, then Schuttpelz approves. Hes not so much protecting us from getting taken over as giving us some advantages that everybody else has when they come here, he said.\nAdvertisement\nThe belief he expressed Saturday in Remsen, in the wake of the deadliest attack on American Jews in history, is prevalent across Iowas 4th District, where King is seeking a ninth term in Congress.\nIn his 16 years in the House, King has become better known for making incendiary remarks about immigration and race than for passing a bill. He has maligned some Latinos as having calves the size of cantaloupes because theyre hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. He has defended the Confederate flag and displayed one on his desk.\nHe has embraced far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders and recently endorsed Faith Goldy, a fringe candidate for Toronto mayor who was fired by a far-right publication for appearing on a podcast produced by the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer.\nIn an August interview with members of a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties, King lamented that Western civilization is on the decline because of immigrants and criticized Jewish financier George Soros.\nAdvertisement\nWhat does this diversity bring that we dont already have? he asked then.\nIn an interview after Saturdays shooting in Pittsburgh, King said he was not anti-Semitic, touting his strong support for Israel and insisting theres a special place in hell for anyone who perpetrates religious or race-based violence.\nHow do you call Steve King anti-Semitic? he asked, just before giving a speech supporting gun rights at a dinner celebrating the first day of pheasant hunting season in the western Iowa town of Akron.\nHe said the groups hes associated with that are criticized as having neo-Nazi views were more accurately far right groups. He specifically cited Austrias Freedom Party, which was founded by a former Nazi SS officer and is led by Heinz-Christian Strache, who was active in neo-Nazi circles as a youth. The group has emphasized a hard-line anti-immigration stance even as it seeks to distance itself from the Nazi connections.\nAdvertisement\nIf they were in America pushing the platform that they push, they would be Republicans, King said.\nKings Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, has significantly outraised him and has mounted a far more aggressive in-person campaign across the district. The Sioux City Journal on Friday endorsed Scholten, reversing its backing of King in past years.\nEach time King immerses himself in controversy, he holds up this district to ridicule and marginalizes himself within the legislative body he serves, neither of which provides benefit to Iowans who live and work here, the endorsement said, citing King for tying himself to intolerant ugliness.\nLast week, Scholten, on the 37th stop of his third 39-county swing through the area, largely avoided bashing King, and even more rarely talked about President Trump. Like many Midwestern Democrats, he has focused on health care and agriculture.\nAdvertisement\nOn Saturday, a Scholten aide said the Pittsburgh shooting had sparked a new wave of donations to his campaign.\nIn an interview, Scholten said King has failed throughout his career to denounce hate groups.\nIt goes against everything we are taught in church, he said. Whatever you believe in, this district has strong faith, and none of these faiths preach this.\nBut King remains popular; many voters do not consider his positions disqualifying.\nBob Scott, the mayor of Sioux City  the largest town in the sprawling district  says Iowans dont share Kings views, although they do vote for him.\nThey may have problems with immigration. They may have problems about race relations for whatever reason, he said. But the majority wont agree with what goes on when hes meeting with those people from Austria. I just dont see that type of racism here, and thats what it is.\nAdvertisement\nAcross the 4th District  a highly conservative swath of Iowa nearly 200 miles wide, mile upon mile of fertile farmland dotted with towns the length of a two-block Main Street  King has widespread support.\nSteves Steve. Hes a local guy. He graduated from high school here. He comes in for breakfast on Sundays, says Crawford County Supervisor Eric Skoog, who with his wife, Terri, owns what they believe to be the oldest continuously operating restaurant in Iowa.\nAt the counter of Cronks, which has been open since 1929, Skoog says he disagrees with King on immigration and hasnt been afraid to share his conflicting views. Skoog has worked hard to help local schools adjust to the influx of immigrant children in Denison, one place in the heavily white district where a major meatpacking plant has drawn a sizable Hispanic community.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Skoog said, I dont see him as racist. I dont know. Hes just Steve. Come November, he said, hell probably vote for him.\nSome in the district welcome Kings blunt talk.\nWere getting pretty happy in this country about kicking the white guy. Only one group of people havent achieved minority status, and its white men, says Steve Sorensen, a former truck driver, watching the World Series in a Hampton bar. You can fire a white man every time you want. Hes got no recourse. Try that with anybody else.\nMindy Rainer also believes that others get government benefits more easily than she does, as a white woman. There are people out there that are desperate as hell, and Im one of them, she says, sliding up to the bar at the restaurant in the town of Cherokee where she works.\nRainers husband was injured on a job site 25 years ago, she said, and denied disability benefits because of bureaucratic hurdles. She has supported them both, but now her kidneys are failing and she fears that she wont be able to work for the eight years until her husband can collect Social Security.\nAdvertisement\nRainer recalled lining up to try to get help with her utility bills when she lived in South Carolina and becoming suspicious of the others in line, almost all of them African American.\nWhat upset me more than anything was all them black babies were dressed up in the best clothes, she said. When their kids are wearing $150 tennis shoes, what do you think?\nShe sides with King when he talks about immigration. Why should we feed others when we cant feed ourselves? she asked.\nKings nativist views are far less popular among the areas business leaders, who see immigration as essential to filling the needs of meat-processing plants and other companies.\nWe need more people. We have great-paying jobs. We just need more people to fill the jobs, said Kelly Halsted, the economic development director for the Greater Fort Dodge Growth Alliance, a business organization. Immigration into Iowa, she says, is completely a positive.\nAdvertisement\nKings stance on the issue is totally wrong, she said, but shell still vote for him because she believes he has helped steer money to Iowa projects: You have to take the good with the bad, right?\nAs a Halloween parade marched through Cherokee, passing Kings campaign posters in a window near the starting point, others said they would spurn their longtime congressman this year. Martee Heinse, a Republican who said shes pleased with Trump, heard Scholtens television ads and came away impressed by his positive tone.\nLets have a change, since weve had the other guy for so long, she said.\nScott Embrock, parading with children dressed as a small skeleton, a little witch and a superhero, was more emphatic.\nI think its about time hes gone, he said of King. He deals with neo-Nazis. Hes anti-anybody whos not white. And I dont think thats right.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Based on both internal and external validation checks, the caption accurately reflects the image and context. The internal check finds high confidence (score 10) because the image clearly shows Representative Steve King, and the caption correctly identifies him. The external check also shows high confidence (score 8) as it supports the caption by citing a news article stating that King is seeking a ninth term in Congress.  The external check strengthens the internal assessment by providing verifiable evidence from a reputable news source. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The slight difference in confidence scores (10 vs 8) is likely due to the nature of the checks; the internal check relies on visual identification and contextual understanding of the image, while the external check involves verifying information from an external source.  The high confidence scores from both checks indicate a strong likelihood that the caption is factually accurate and not out of context. The external source provides crucial corroboration, solidifying the assertion that the image shows Steve King during his campaign for a ninth term in Congress.  No conflicts are present; both validation methods align perfectly with the caption's information.  Given the alignment and the high confidence level, the conclusion that the caption is not out of context is reliable and well-supported by the evidence.  There's no reason to doubt the accuracy of either the image identification or the external verification of King's political status.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows Steve King, and an external news article confirms he was seeking a ninth term in Congress at the time.  No discrepancies were found."

He is currently incarcerated in a high-security Mexican prison and is in the process of being extradited to the United States.\nThis article was published on 9 January 2017, and while the author claimed that Assange made the comment at a \"conference\" over the weekend (referring to the 7th and 8th of January), the included photograph was actually taken in February 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder appeared via a video stream for a news conference in which he discussed his possible extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault charge, not improper donations from El Chapo to the Clinton Foundation.\nAs well, Times.com.mx suggested that Assange made his comment in a room full of reporters, yet no legitimate news reports or video clips have surfaced confirming that Assange made any such statment. Furthermore, Times.com.mx did not provide any links to back up their sources or any specific details (such as the time and place of this \"conference\") which could give their report credibility.\nWhile Times.com.mx does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction, this story of theirs is clearly just more fake news.",

    "explanation": "The claim made in the caption, that Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check reveals a significant discrepancy: the image shows El Chapo's arrest, providing no visual evidence of any donations. The lack of visual evidence supporting the donation claim lowers the internal confidence score. The external check uses Snopes.com as a reliable source, which explicitly debunks the claim, labeling it as \"fake news.\" This external verification strengthens the assessment and provides a high confidence score.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently confirm the caption's falsity. The high confidence score (10) reflects the strong agreement between both validation methods and the readily available evidence from a reputable fact-checking website. The internal check highlights the absence of any visual context supporting the claim, underscoring its inaccuracy.  The external check provides definitive evidence from a trusted source, dismissing the caption as fabricated.  Therefore, the caption is entirely out of context, inaccurately associating El Chapo's arrest with a false claim of a significant donation to the Clinton Foundation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image lacks evidence of the claimed donation, and a reputable fact-checking website confirms the claim as false."

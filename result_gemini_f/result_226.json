        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes.com debunks the claim in the news caption. While the video exists and was filmed in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was created by a comedian for entertainment purposes, not as a depiction of government-sanctioned actions by the Maasai tribe.  The article does mention that the Kenyan government employed violent tactics to enforce stay-at-home orders, but doesn't confirm the use of the Maasai tribe in this manner. Therefore, the caption is partially supported by the existence of the video within the context of the pandemic, but the core claim about government use of the Maasai tribe for enforcement is false.

  "final_result": {

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Based on both internal and external evidence, the original caption is deemed out of context. The internal check reveals a significant discrepancy: while the image shows a person who seems to be of Maasai tribe in Kenya, it lacks any depiction of whipping or individuals disobeying self-quarantine orders. This suggests a mismatch between the visual content and the caption's narrative.  The internal check gives a low confidence score of 7, reflecting this partial alignment. The external check corroborates this assessment by citing a Snopes.com article. The article explicitly debunks the claim that the Kenyan government used the Maasai tribe to enforce self-quarantine measures through whipping.  It clarifies that the video originates from a Kenyan comedian and is intended as entertainment, not a factual representation of governmental actions. The external check's confidence score is 4, which, while lower, supports the same conclusion of the caption being out of context.  The disagreement in confidence scores between the internal and external checks reflects the difference in their scope. The internal check is solely based on the image, while the external check uses additional information from an external source.  However, both assessments independently reach the conclusion that the caption's main claim is unsupported by the available evidence.  The convergence of findings from both assessments strengthens the confidence in the final verdict. In conclusion, the low confidence score from the internal check and the supporting evidence from the external check regarding the comedic nature of the video point towards the caption being significantly out of context. Therefore, the final confidence score is set at 9, reflecting a high degree of certainty in the conclusion.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the caption is out of context. The image does not depict the events described, and an external source confirms the video's comedic intent, contradicting the caption's claim."

The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The image is clearly a poster for a movie titled \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks,\" featuring Kate Winslet. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  The external check, with a confidence score of 10, strongly refutes the caption's claim by citing a Snopes fact-check. Snopes explicitly states that Disney has not announced any remake of \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" with Kate Winslet. The source directly contradicts the caption's assertion, highlighting the claim as a false rumor spread by a fan-made poster.  The conflict between the internal and external checks is substantial. While the image strongly suggests a potential remake, the reputable source from Snopes definitively debunks this claim. Considering the high confidence scores from both checks and the strong evidence from Snopes, the caption is deemed out of context.  The internal check's analysis is solely based on the visual information of the image, neglecting broader contextual information regarding announcements from Disney. Thus, the external check's findings, supported by a fact-checking website known for accuracy, prevail. There is no ambiguity in the Snopes article; it clearly states the lack of any such announcement from Disney. The weight is given to external validation because it checks against real-world facts and statements from authoritative sources.  In conclusion, although the image seemingly supports the caption, the external evidence decisively proves the claim false, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check validates the caption based on image content, while external check strongly refutes it citing a Snopes fact-check. The external validation outweighs the internal validation due to verifiable evidence from a reliable source.  Caption is deemed out of context."

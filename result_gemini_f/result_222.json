        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people have marched through the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to protest against President Nicolas Maduro.\nOpposition supporters, staging their largest rally for two years, called for Mr Maduro's removal.\nThey blame him for Venezuela's economic crisis and accuse the electoral commission of delaying a referendum that could shorten his stay in power.\nMr Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers.\nHe accuses the opposition of trying to stage a coup.\nThe opposition said close to a million people turned out for their march, dubbed the \"Takeover of Caracas\", but the government disputed the figures.\n\"We have shown to the world the importance of Venezuela and how much it wants change,\" said opposition politician Jesus Torrealba.\nDressed predominantly in white, they chanted \"we are going to bring down Maduro\".\nProtesters said they had enough of the policies of the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela.\n\"We are going to defeat hunger, crime, inflation and corruption. They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,\" Naty Gutierrez told Reuters news agency.\nA small group of protesters clashed with riot police as the peaceful rally ended.\n\"The nation has triumphed. They wanted to intimidate the people but the people are here,\" said Mr Maduro at a rally in central Caracas he said was attended by 30,000 people.\n\"We have defeated an attempted coup that tried to fill Venezuela and Caracas with violence, death,\" he said.\nThe opposition hopes the march will pressure the electoral authorities into allowing them to launch the second petition needed to trigger the recall referendum as soon as possible.\nTiming is key as the date when the referendum is held will determine what happens next.\nIf a referendum should go against the president before 10 January, new elections will be held, which the opposition hopes to win.\nBut if it is held after that date and Mr Maduro is recalled, his loyal vice-president will serve out the end of his term until 2019.",

      "explanation": "Source 1, from the BBC, reports on a political rally in Caracas for Mr. Maduro, mentioning that \"Mr Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers.\"  This directly supports the claim in the news caption. The article provides context by describing simultaneous anti-Maduro protests, highlighting the presence of both supporters and opponents of the president at rallies in Caracas. The BBC is a reputable news source, adding to the confidence in the claim's veracity.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Based on both internal and external validation checks, the caption \"Government supporters at a political rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas\" is considered accurate. The internal check yielded a high confidence score (8) because the image clearly shows a crowd of people holding flags and signs that support Maduro. The presence of Maduro's image on a sign further reinforces this observation.  The external check also produced a high confidence score (8), supported by a BBC news report that mentions a political rally in Caracas for Mr. Maduro with a large turnout of his supporters. This corroborates the information conveyed in the caption. The alignment between the image content and the caption is strong, as the visual evidence aligns perfectly with the caption's description of a political rally supporting Maduro. There are no apparent discrepancies or conflicts between the internal and external checks. Both independently validate the caption's accuracy. The high confidence scores from both checks (8 out of 10 for each) demonstrate a strong degree of certainty in the caption's validity. Therefore, the caption is not out of context and is deemed accurate.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption, with high confidence scores.  The image content and external news report corroborate the description of a pro-Maduro rally in Caracas."

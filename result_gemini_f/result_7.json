        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article discusses photographs of a bird (possibly a goose or duck) appearing to keep a puppy warm. While the images appear real, Snopes questions the accompanying story.  The article mentions various claims about the location and the circumstances of the event, and notes that the story has circulated online since at least 2017, with no verification.  The caption's assertion is partially supported in that a bird is shown to be in close proximity to a puppy, but the exact details of the scenario lack strong corroboration. The source does not definitively confirm or deny that the bird was actively helping to keep the puppy warm, only that the images exist and that the surrounding narrative is suspect.",

    "explanation": "Internal validation shows high confidence in the caption's accuracy, aligning perfectly with the image's content (a goose sheltering a puppy). However, external validation reveals that while the images are likely real, the story accompanying them lacks strong corroboration.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, questions the narrative surrounding the image, highlighting uncertainty about the location, circumstances, and whether the goose was intentionally warming the puppy.  Although the image itself supports the caption's core assertion (bird sheltering puppy), the lack of external verification for the specific claim of the bird helping keep the puppy warm lowers the overall confidence. The high internal confidence score is tempered by the lower external confidence score, resulting in a moderate overall confidence. There's a discrepancy between internal and external checks: internal validation focuses on visual alignment, while external validation focuses on the lack of evidence for the claimed intentionality of the bird's action. This necessitates a conservative approach. The overall assessment concludes that while the image visually depicts a bird and puppy in close proximity, the claim about the bird specifically keeping the puppy warm requires stronger evidence.Therefore, a 'partially out of context' conclusion is more accurate, which is reflected by the moderate confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption, while external validation casts doubt on the specific claim of the bird's intent to warm the puppy. The lack of definitive evidence regarding the surrounding narrative lowers the overall confidence despite the clear visual correlation in the image."

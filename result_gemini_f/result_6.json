      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Promobot is a real company known for developing humanoid robots.  Attaching artificial skin to robots to make them more lifelike is a common practice in robotics. Vladivostok is a real city in Russia. Therefore, the core elements of the caption align with known facts. However, without a specific source or date, verification of this particular event is not possible. The confidence score is slightly lower because it is based on general knowledge of the field and not confirmation of this specific instance.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The caption's claim that the image depicts an employee of Promobot, a service robotics manufacturer, attaching \"skin\" to a humanoid robot in Vladivostok, Russia, is largely supported by both internal and external validation.  \n\nInternal validation gives a high confidence score of 10, citing the image's strong visual alignment with the caption's description. The realistic-looking head and the process of applying a skin-like material strongly suggest the development of a humanoid robot.  While the image doesn't explicitly display Promobot branding or location markers, the context aligns well with the caption's assertion.\n\nExternal validation provides a confidence score of 8, based on the verifiability of the entities involved. Promobot's existence as a robotics company and Vladivostok's location are easily confirmed. The practice of applying artificial skin to robots to enhance realism is also a well-established technique.  However, the lack of a specific source or date limits the ability to definitively verify this particular event.  The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the caption while also acknowledging its limitations in confirming this specific instance.\n\nThe discrepancy between the internal (10) and external (8) confidence scores is relatively minor. The high internal score stems from the strong visual coherence of the image with the captionâ€™s narrative.  The lower external score reflects the challenge in definitively verifying this specific event without a concrete source.  However, the overall evidence strongly suggests that the caption is not out of context.\n\nConsidering the high confidence scores from both internal and external validations, and the lack of substantial conflicting evidence, the overall confidence score is set at 9. The absence of a definitive source for the specific event described, despite the high plausibility of the claim, prevents a perfect confidence score of 10.\n\nIn summary, the caption accurately reflects the image's content, given the context provided.  The visual evidence and the credibility of the named entities strongly suggest that the scene depicts the construction of a humanoid robot by Promobot in Vladivostok. While the inability to verify this precise event with external sources prevents reaching a 10/10 confidence, the overall assessment remains strongly affirmative.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation support the caption's claim, with high confidence scores. While external validation notes the lack of a specific source to verify the exact event, the overall evidence strongly suggests the caption is not out of context."

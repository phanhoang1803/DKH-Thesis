Source 1, from BBC, reports on the Bola Tinubu inauguration ceremony at Eagle Square, Abuja, mentioning the presence of various dignitaries. While the source doesn't explicitly state people dressed in Nigerian flag colors were present, the context strongly suggests the possibility.  The absence of direct contradiction and the relevant timeframe make a positive verdict plausible, but without explicit mention in the source, confidence remains moderate.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check finds strong support for the caption's accuracy. The woman in the image is clearly dressed in colors resembling the Nigerian flag (green and white), and the setting appears consistent with a large public square, aligning with the description of Abuja's Eagle Square. The confidence score of 10 reflects this strong internal alignment.\n\nThe external validation, while not offering direct confirmation of individuals dressed in Nigerian flag colors at the event, provides supporting context. The BBC source mentions the inauguration ceremony at Eagle Square, Abuja, with the attendance of various dignitaries and the public.  The absence of explicit mention of people in Nigerian flag colors doesn't disprove the caption, as such details are often omitted in broader news reports. The moderate confidence score of 7 reflects this indirect but plausible connection. \n\nConsidering both checks, the discrepancies are minor. While the external check doesn't directly confirm the specific detail of people in Nigerian flag colors, it strongly supports the overall context of an event at Abuja's Eagle Square. There's no evidence to contradict the caption. Therefore, the caption is deemed not out of context.\n\nThe final confidence score is 8, reflecting the strong internal validation and the plausible, although less direct, external validation. The final verdict leans towards acceptance due to the lack of contradictory evidence and the strong contextual alignment provided by both validation methods.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy, showing strong alignment between the image content and the caption's description. External validation offers supporting contextual evidence but lacks direct confirmation of the specific detail regarding individuals' attire. However, the external context doesn't contradict the caption. Overall, both checks point towards the caption being in context, albeit with a slightly lower confidence score due to the indirect external validation."

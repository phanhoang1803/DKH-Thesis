Hawns shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russells shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts.

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook page that posted the photo did not immediately respond to a message asking for evidence for its claim.\nAn image search shows the photo is doctored.\nThe photo was taken of the couple years ago while Hawn and Russell were out in Los Angeles, according to a September 2015 PopSugar article. They can be seen walking together, holding hands and wearing the same outfits the altered photo shows them in  only without American flags or references to Trump or ISIS on their white shirts.\nIts not the first time Russell has been tied to Trump in viral social media posts. An image recently circulated on Facebook with a quote from Russell praising Trump. We rated that Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nAn altered photo attempts to depict Russell and Hawn as Trump supporters, by adding \"Trump 2016,\" American flags and more to their shirts. An image search quickly shows those arent the original outfits the couple was wearing.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) and a positive verdict, stating that the image shows Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wearing Donald Trump t-shirts.  This is based solely on a visual inspection of the image. However, the external check also provides a high confidence score (10) but gives a negative verdict. It cites three reputable fact-checking sources (Politifact and Snopes) that definitively debunk the image as digitally fabricated.  These sources present compelling evidence, including reverse image searches and comparisons to original, unaltered photos, that confirm the image's inauthenticity. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks is significant. The internal check relies on a subjective visual assessment that is easily manipulated. The external check, on the other hand, employs rigorous verification methods to confirm that the image is a fake.  Given the strong, verifiable evidence from multiple independent fact-checking organizations, the external check's verdict must be given precedence. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because the image it describes is demonstrably false.  There is no uncertainty in this case because the weight of evidence heavily favors the external check, which used robust methods to establish the falsity of the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the image's accuracy, while external check demonstrates high confidence that the image is doctored. External validation, supported by multiple fact-checking sources, overrides internal visual assessment. The caption is deemed out of context."

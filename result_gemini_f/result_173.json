        "content": "There are some good arguments for lowering the drinking age from 21: It is unpopular among most young adults; it arguably encourages underground binge drinking; enforcement is a complete failure on college campuses. And it is notable, of course, that an 18-year-old is considered an adult in almost every context -- including in the voting booth -- except when ordering a beer.\nBut research has shown that a drinking age of 21 does reduce alcohol use by those under 21, including high school students. Alcohol consumption by young adults has demonstrable and serious costs: for example, a lower drinking age leads to more traffic fatalities. Indeed, traffic accidents are a primary reason why Vietnam-era experimentation with lower drinking ages was abandoned. Other impacts of lowering the drinking age may be less obvious, but no less costly.\nMy research with Angela Fertig examined the impact of the drinking age by looking back at the 1980s, when many states moved from a minimum of 18 to 21. Our study found that a lower drinking age was associated with a statistically higher risk of unintended pregnancy and, largely as a result, worse infant health.\nResearch by economists Christopher Carpenter and Carlos Dobkin shows that arrest rates for violent and nuisance crimes rise sharply at age 21 and persist through at least age 23. A lower drinking age would likely cause this period of alcohol-related criminal activity to start earlier and last longer. Evidence also suggests that a lower drinking age leads to higher levels of binge drinking later in life among men.\nAny move toward increasing alcohol availability to young adults must consider its adverse effects, including traffic fatalities, unplanned pregnancy and crime. Policies like increased public transit availability, access to birth control and educational initiatives focused on harm reduction rather than abstinence have been shown to mitigate the detrimental effects of alcohol use by young adults. Lowering the drinking age will only succeed as part of a comprehensive set of policies that address the unintended consequences.",

      "explanation": "The provided text focuses on the debate surrounding lowering the drinking age, not raising it.  Therefore, it's not relevant to the news caption's claim.  The source is from a reputable news domain (The New York Times), but the article does not address the caption's specific claim. There is no information to support or contradict the claim that the drinking age was raised to 23.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption \"The legal drinking age has been raised to 23\" is out of context with the provided image. The image depicts two glasses of flaming liquid, which is irrelevant to a discussion about changes in the legal drinking age.  The internal check found no connection between the image content and the caption, assigning a confidence score of 0. The external check, while attempting to verify the claim about the drinking age change through an external source, found no evidence to support the statement. In fact, the external source focused on a different aspect of the drinking age debate which further strengthens the claim of the caption being out of context. The external check assigned a confidence score of 3, indicating a lack of support for the caption's assertion. The high agreement between the internal and external checks, indicating a strong mismatch between caption and image, leads to a high confidence score of 10 for the overall assessment. The caption is clearly unrelated to the image's content, and there is no factual basis for the drinking age claim made in the caption.  There is no ambiguity or conflict between the internal and external checks. The analysis is straightforward: the caption is completely irrelevant to the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes decisively confirm that the caption is out of context with the image.  The image shows flaming cocktails; the caption discusses a nonexistent legal drinking age change."

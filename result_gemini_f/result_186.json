That protection is now gone. The employees involved in murder and disabling people world wide have two choices: Become a whistle blower or face 20 years to life in prison.\nThere is no place you can hide on this planet or in this planet.\nSo what is in Vaccines that make them so deadly???\nOf the 202 children we have worked with 2 were autistic due to Vaccines given to the Mothers while she was in the military. The other 200 became autistic the day they were vaccinated and all have Indigo Aura ... Those with Chrystaline Auras were killed outright. This author has a Chrystaline Aura.",

      "explanation": "The claim is thoroughly debunked by Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website.

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The claim made in the caption is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check correctly identifies the CDC building in the image but notes the absence of any evidence supporting the claim of an FBI raid.  This aligns perfectly with the external check, which cites Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, to definitively debunk the claim.  Snopes provides clear evidence that the claim originated from a known hoax purveyor and lacks any credible supporting evidence.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence scores (8 from the internal check and 10 from the external check) further solidify this conclusion.  The external validation's confidence score of 10 reflects the definitive nature of the debunking provided by Snopes, while the internal check's score of 8 accounts for the visual aspect which confirms the presence of the CDC but lacks any depiction of the purported FBI raid.  No additional entity analysis is needed to resolve discrepancies as both checks are in perfect agreement regarding the falsity of the caption.  In summary, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the caption is entirely fabricated and has no basis in reality.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly and consistently confirm that the caption is out of context. The internal check points out the lack of visual evidence of an FBI raid, while the external check uses a reputable source (Snopes) to definitively debunk the claim as a hoax."

        "content": "Claim:\nSarah Palin wants to ban \"Arabic numerals\" from American schools.\nIn April 2016, a story popped up on a hoax news web site reporting that former Alaska governor (and John McCain's running mate in the 2008 Presidential race) Sarah Palin took to Facebook to demand a ban on \"Arabic numerals\" in U.S. schools:\nIn keeping with the Republican partys platform of proposed safeguards, Palin also called for advanced screening for all teachers:\nIf foreign elements can swimmingly cross over the river and through the woods, they can just as easily infiltrate the teaching profession in ways we must not encourage. These dangerous foreign walk-overs who look more and more like real every-day normal Americans, lured with gift baskets and teddy bears, often blend into the very footholds of our societal norms after establishing dangerous toeholds.\nPalin, known as a vocal and athletic supporter of Donald Trump, said that she is now a double-barreled, locked and loaded supporter of both Trumps and Ted Cruzs proposed guidelines for stricter immigration laws, border protections and neighborhood scrutinies.\n-An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Mrs. Palins call for the removal of Aerobics from physical education courses. The author regrets the error.\nThere is no truth to this story, which came from a well-known (and prolific) hoax and satire news site. The joke in this case is that \"Arabic numerals\" (also known as Hindu-Arabic numerals) are the numbers most familiar to much of the world, and originated in India during the 6th or 7th century. They were introduced to Europe by mathematicians from what is now the Middle East (shown here as they appeared in the Codex Vigilianus around the 10th century):\nPalin has thrown her political backing behind Trump, and has been active on traditional and social media expressing that support. However, she has made no mention of banning numbers, whether of Hindu-Arabic or Roman origin.",

      "explanation": "The claim that Sarah Palin wants to ban \"Arabic numerals\" from American schools is False. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks this claim, stating that the story originated from a satire news website.  The article details the satirical nature of the claim and points out that Palin has made no such statement. ",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence in the caption's alignment with the image, focusing on the presence of Sarah Palin and relevant keywords. However, the external check, using Snopes as a source, reveals that the claim is false.  The external check's high confidence score (10) and its strong evidence from a reputable fact-checking website outweigh the internal check's assessment.  The discrepancy arises because the image only shows Sarah Palin speaking; it provides no information about the content of her speech. The caption, therefore, makes an assertion not supported by the image itself.  Snopes's detailed explanation, which cites the claim's origin in a satire news website and the lack of any public statement by Palin supporting this claim, definitively demonstrates that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context.  While the internal check correctly identifies the presence of Sarah Palin in the image, it fails to validate the claim made in the caption. The external check provides crucial context missing from the image and the internal assessment, leading to a conclusive judgment that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence from the reputable fact-checking website and the clear contradiction between the image and the caption's assertion.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in entity alignment. External check (Snopes) reveals caption is factually incorrect;  high confidence in its refutation. The external check's findings outweigh the internal assessment, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

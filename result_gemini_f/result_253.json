    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy, primarily because the image clearly depicts a common kingfisher catching a fish.  The mention of Tiszaalpar, Hungary, is considered plausible due to the bird's habitat. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy, showing low confidence (3) and a verdict of CANNOT_VERIFY. The external check indicates a lack of supporting evidence from relevant sources to corroborate the claim of the kingfisher's location. The conflict arises from the internal assessment relying solely on visual evidence within the image, while the external check highlights the absence of supporting external information to confirm the location mentioned in the caption.  This discrepancy is crucial, as the location forms a crucial part of the caption's claim.  While the image strongly supports the kingfisher catching a fish, the uncertainty surrounding the specified location in Hungary significantly reduces the overall confidence level.  Without independent verification of the location, we cannot definitively confirm the caption's accuracy. The final assessment leans toward 'out of context' (OOC: True) due to the significant confidence gap and the inability to externally verify the key geographical claim, even though the visual aspects within the image are consistent with the caption's main description of a kingfisher catching a fish. The low confidence score (4) reflects the inability to resolve the discrepancy fully and highlights the reliance on visual information without adequate external corroboration.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption (confidence: 10), but external verification fails to confirm the location (confidence: 3), resulting in a conflict. The lack of external evidence lowers the overall confidence and leads to an 'out of context' assessment."

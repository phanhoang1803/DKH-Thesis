        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the caption \"The Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut\" is out of context. The internal check, while acknowledging the image depicts a doll resembling Annabelle, expresses uncertainty about the escape event and location, giving a confidence score of 8. The external check, however, provides definitive evidence from Snopes.com and a YouTube video by Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, confirming that the Annabelle doll never left the museum. This external evidence gives a confidence score of 10.  The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty. The internal check is less confident because the image itself doesn't show the escape, whereas the external check provides explicit statements refuting the escape claim.  However, both checks align in their conclusion that the caption is inaccurate.  The higher confidence score of 10 from the external validation prevails due to the strong evidence provided by Snopes and Spera's statement.  In summary, there is substantial evidence from reliable sources to disprove the claim of the Annabelle doll's escape, rendering the caption out of context.",

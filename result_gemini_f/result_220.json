        "content": "Claim:\nA San Francisco mural portrait of Greta Thunberg used 700 gallons of spray paint.\nIn November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about widely shared social media posts claiming irony or hypocrisy at work in the production of a massive San Francisco mural in honor of the young climate activist Greta Thunberg.\nOn Nov. 8, the right-leaning social media activist Brandon Straka tweeted a link to a KPIX-TV article about the mural, adding his own view that, \"The leftist geniuses in San Francisco have decided to send a message about climate change by creating a 6 story [sic] mural of Greta Thunberg using 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\"\nThe text of Straka's tweet, and screenshots of it, were further promulgated by multiple users on Facebook. The KPIX-TV article to which he linked did not contain any reference to the paint used by Argentinian artist Andrs Pereoselli (known as \"Cobre\") in creating the Thunberg mural. As such, it did not provide any evidence to support Straka's key claim, that the portrait of the climate activist required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\nIt's not clear where that figure came from, but it might have originated in an article on the right-leaning website The Blaze, which wrote:\n\"While it is unclear how many spray cans [Cobre] has used, the mural spans four stories and at least one smaller project utilized 500 cans of the paint scientists say can generate asthma-inducing smog.\"\nThe Daily Wire, another right-leaning website, subsequently extrapolated that \"the Thunberg mural will likely take closer to 700 cans to finish.\"\nAnalysis\nIn response to concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint, One Atmosphere, a California environmental non-profit group that collaborated with Cobre on the mural, posted the following explanation to Instagram on Nov. 11:\nSome folks have been asking about the environmental impacts of the Greta mural. Read on for some details. The vast majority of the paint is water-based acrylic exterior paint that was rolled onto the building by hand. The finishing details can only be done with spray paint, but we are using spray cans without CFCs. (CFCs are tremendously damaging to the environment). We are using low pressure cans with a minimal footprint. The cans and the boxes will also be recycled, although many of the cans will first have a second life as part of a separate art project.\nThe cans have been picked up and delivered in an electric vehicle, and the artist and organizers have been travelling almost exclusively by way of electric car, electric scooter or on foot to the project site. The lift being used is also electric, not diesel. We are doing our best to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in that order!\nAfter the completion of the project, One Atmosphere's Executive Director Paul Scott provided further details to Snopes in an email. He firmly rejected the claim that the project required 700 gallons, or even 700 cans, of spray paint.\nIn reality, Scott said he counted a total of 117 used 400-ml cans of spray paint, almost all of them from the MTN 94 brand. That's just over 12 gallons in total. However, only some of that 400-ml capacity is taken up by the hydrocarbon propellant that escapes into the atmosphere (as opposed to the liquid paint, which ends up on the side of the building).\nAll aerosol spray paints use a propellant to help disperse the paint from the can and onto its intended surface. In the past, manufacturers used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals that were widely banned from the late 1980s onwards due to the fact that they deplete the ozone layers in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.\nIn the United States in 2019, spray paint manufacturers use hydrocarbons such as propane and butane as propellants. Unlike CFCs, hydrocarbons don't have a deleterious effect on ozone, but they do have a small effect on global warming. However, it's worth putting the scale of that effect into some context, using a measure known as Global Warming Potential.\nAs the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains on its website:\n\"The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period.\"\nThe CFCs used as propellants in aerosol paint in the past have a GWP of between 5,000 and 14,000. Propane, a hydrocarbon commonly used now as a propellant in spray paint, has a GWP of 4. In his email to Snopes, Scott added that, \"The amount of the propellant is also less because the cans are lower pressure, and obviously only a portion of each can is propellant, so the ultimate GWP impact of the cans we used is very limited.\"",

      "explanation": "The claim that a San Francisco mural of Greta Thunberg used 700 gallons of spray paint is addressed by a fact-checking article from Snopes.com.  Snopes debunks this claim, citing an environmental non-profit group's statement that the actual amount of spray paint used was significantly less, around 12 gallons.  The initial claim was a gross exaggeration spread by a right-leaning social media activist. Therefore, the news caption is considered false based on the fact-check article's findings.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check assessed the caption's alignment with the image, focusing on the entities present (Greta Thunberg's portrait in San Francisco).  It found a strong match for the depicted entities but acknowledged the unverified claim of paint usage.  The internal check gave a high confidence score of 10 because the core elements of the caption (location and subject) are accurately reflected in the image. However, the external validation check provided evidence contradicting the claim of 700 gallons of spray paint.  Snopes.com fact-checked this information, revealing the claim was a significant exaggeration.  The actual amount used was approximately 12 gallons, as reported by the involved environmental non-profit. Snopes' confidence score is also 10, based on solid reporting and corroborating evidence from the organization involved in the mural project. Therefore, there's a direct conflict between the findings.  While the image supports the depiction of Greta Thunberg in San Francisco, the quantitative statement about paint usage is demonstrably false. This discrepancy highlights a limitation of purely visual assessment. The image alone doesn't provide sufficient information to verify the claim about paint quantity.  Hence, the overall assessment leans towards 'out of context' because the significant factual error in the caption outweighs the accurate depiction of location and subject. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence from the fact-checking website and the clear mismatch between the caption's numerical claim and the reality verified externally. The internal check's high confidence was solely about the visual aspects and not on the claim about the amount of paint. The external check's high confidence stems from a detailed and well-sourced fact-check investigation that directly contradicts the caption's quantitative assertion.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation found strong alignment with image content for location and subject, but could not verify the paint quantity claim. External validation revealed this claim was false according to Snopes.com and involved project non-profit, leading to a final assessment that the caption is out of context."

In fact, users who clicked the above-displayed message were greeted with a popup message requesting permission from a Facebook app to post on their behalf, making the article appear less like a hoax and more like an outright scam:\nMessages about Jaden Smith's alleged suicide were shared from various sites, and led to a variety of dodgy-sounding Facebook apps, including \"Smart Mobiles,\" \"Gadgy Land,\" \"Pakiza,\" \"Top Feeds\" and several others.\nIntrepid internet users who clicked the link and gave the app permission were eventually greeted with one of several \"news\" story claiming that Jaden Smith had committed suicide. The web sites responsible for this hoax have published dozens of fake news stories and graphics with this false claim:\nUsers who granted these apps permission to post to Facebook on their behalf quickly found this death hoax posted to their own Facebook feeds, thereby replicating itself across social media.\nJaden Smith himself has been active on his social media accounts, seemingly unaware that he's supposed to be dead. He posted a photograph of himself on 27 July 2016:",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption \"Actor Jaden Smith committed suicide in July 2016\" is completely out of context and factually incorrect. The internal check identifies the factual inaccuracy and the lack of image support for the claim, assigning a confidence score of 0. The external check provides strong evidence from a reputable fact-checking source (Snopes.com) that debunks the suicide claim as a hoax, giving it a confidence score of 10.  There is no discrepancy between the two checks; they both definitively refute the caption's claim. The image itself shows Jaden Smith alive and well, alongside his father Will Smith, further supporting the falsity of the caption.  The high confidence score from the external check, combined with the internal check's confirmation of the factual error, leads to a final confidence score of 10. The caption is demonstrably false and bears no relation to the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly confirm that the caption is factually incorrect and completely out of context.  The claim of Jaden Smith's suicide is debunked by a reliable source, and the image itself contradicts the caption."

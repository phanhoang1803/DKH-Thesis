      "explanation": "The New York Times article directly supports the claim that the FBI investigated whether President Trump's firing of James Comey was an obstruction of justice, which is a national security concern.  The article details the FBI's investigation examining whether Mr. Trump's actions posed a national security threat. While the caption doesn't explicitly state \"obstruction of justice,\" the investigation into the firing's potential threat to national security is the core point of both the caption and the article.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check highlights the direct visual alignment between the image (James Comey amidst reporters) and the caption's focus on the FBI's investigation into his firing.  The external check reinforces this by citing a New York Times article that explicitly details the FBI's investigation into whether President Trump's firing of James Comey constituted a national security threat.  Both checks independently confirm the core assertion: the FBI investigated the firing of Mr. Comey in relation to national security.  There is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external evaluations.  The high confidence scores from both checks (8/10 each) further bolster the assessment. While the caption doesn't explicitly use the phrase \"obstruction of justice\", the external validation clarifies that this aspect was part of the FBI's broader investigation into the national security implications of Comey's dismissal.  The slight difference in wording doesn't undermine the fundamental accuracy of the caption's assertion about the FBI's investigation and its national security context.  In summary, the strong agreement between the internal visual analysis and the external factual corroboration, both with high confidence scores, leads to a confident conclusion that the caption accurately reflects the context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The FBI's investigation into the national security implications of Comey's firing is confirmed by both visual analysis and external journalistic reporting.  High confidence scores from both checks solidify the assessment."

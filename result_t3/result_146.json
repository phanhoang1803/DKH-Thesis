      "explanation": "The provided external evidence is irrelevant to the news caption.  Source 1 is a BBC article about photographs submitted by the public showing scenes in Scotland.

    "explanation": "The image shows a heron flying over a duck on a river. The caption says the heron is flying over a fellow bird at the River Avon in Hamilton.  The internal check has low confidence due to lack of entities. The external check finds no evidence to support the location claim (River Avon, Hamilton).  There is no strong evidence to contradict the caption regarding the heron and the duck. Therefore, the location claim in the caption is considered out of context. ",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows no mismatch between the caption and the image, but lacks entities to perform a strong assessment. External check fails to verify the location claim, resulting in an OOC verdict."

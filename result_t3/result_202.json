      "explanation": "The plausibility of the news caption is moderate.  While orangutans are intelligent and capable of learning behaviors through observation, the claim that a specific orangutan named Sandra learned handwashing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020 requires further verification.  The timeframe aligns with the initial spread of the pandemic, making the connection plausible; however, the lack of widespread reporting on such an event raises doubts. It's possible the video was manipulated or that the claim's viral spread was exaggerated.  The caption's structure also lacks specific details, such as the location of the zoo or source of the video, further reducing confidence.",
      "supporting_points": "Orangutans are known for their intelligence and observational learning abilities; COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020; April 2020 falls within the initial wave of the pandemic; lack of widespread media coverage about a handwashing orangutan; the caption lacks specific details.",

    "explanation": "The image shows an orangutan appearing to wash a brush in a basin. While this action might be interpreted as handwashing, there is no direct evidence linking it to the COVID-19 pandemic or the specific orangutan named Sandra. The internal check identifies COVID-19 related entities, but the external check highlights the lack of verifiable information supporting the claim.  The visual evidence alone does not confirm or deny the claim, leading to a low confidence score.  Therefore, the caption is likely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows partial alignment with the caption due to the mention of COVID-19, but the external check reveals insufficient evidence to support the specific claim about orangutan Sandra and the pandemic. Visual evidence is inconclusive."

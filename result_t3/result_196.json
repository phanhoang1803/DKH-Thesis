        "date": "2017-03-20T11:31:52",
        "content": "Prime Minister Theresa May is to officially notify the European Union next Wednesday that the UK is leaving.\nDowning Street said she would write a letter to the European Council, adding that it hoped negotiations on the terms of exit and future relations could then begin as quickly as possible.\nAn EU spokesman said it was \"ready and waiting\" for the letter.\nMrs May's spokesman also rejected reports an early election may be held, saying: \"It's not going to happen.\"\nUnder the Article 50 process, talks on the terms of exit and future relations are not allowed until the UK formally tells the EU it is leaving.\nIf all goes according to the two year negotiations allowed for in the official timetable, Brexit should happen in March 2019.\nSpeaking in Swansea on Monday, during the first of a series of visits around the UK before she triggers Article 50, Mrs May said she was intent on \"delivering on Brexit and getting the right deal\".\nLast year's referendum result, she added, \"was not just about leaving the EU\" but was a vote for a \"change in the way the country works\".\n\"Part of that is building a strong economy and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth and prosperity are felt across every part of the UK.\"\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the UK was now \"on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation\".\n\"The government is clear in its aims,\" he said. \"A deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe - a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union.\"\nIn response to the news, Mr Tusk tweeted, external: \"Within 48 hours of the UK triggering Article 50, I will present the draft Brexit guidelines to the EU27 Member States.\"\nMr Tusk has previously said he expects to call an extraordinary summit of the 27 other members within four to six weeks, to draw up a mandate for the European Commission's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Under this scenario, talks are likely to begin in earnest in May.\nSir Tim Barrow, the UK's most senior representative at the EU, said the 27 had had plenty of time to prepare for this moment and he expected them to set out their stall \"pretty quickly\".\n\"Our mandate is clear, it is to get on with it,\" he told MPs on the European Scrutiny Committee. \"There is a timetable that everyone has bought into it.\"\nMrs May said last year that she intended to notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by the end of March. The move was approved by Parliament two weeks ago when peers and MPs passed unchanged a bill giving the prime minister the authority to set the process in motion.\nEU leaders have said they want to conclude the talks within 18 months to allow the terms of the UK's exit to be ratified by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament, as well as approved by the necessary majority of EU states.\nMrs May has said MPs and peers will have a vote on the deal she negotiates but she has insisted the UK will leave anyway even if Parliament rejects it. The government has said it expects to secure a positive outcome but made clear there is a chance of there being no formal agreement with Mrs May saying no deal was better than a bad deal.\nAhead of Mrs May naming the date European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted in German newspaper Bild saying the UK may have to abandon hopes of getting a trade deal if it did not agree to the term offered by the EU.\nThese terms may include a 50bn \"divorce bill\" and Mr Juncker said Brexit could bring the remaining 27 members closer together: \"They will all see from the UK's example that leaving the EU is a bad idea.\"\nLabour's Keir Starmer said the opposition would hold the government to account throughout the process, claiming the prime minister had failed to provide certainty about her plans or prepare for the \"clear dangers\" of not reaching a deal at all.\nThe Scottish National Party's Europe spokesperson at Westminster, Stephen Gethins, said: \"Today's announcement... shatters beyond repair any notion or position that the Prime Minister is seeking a UK-wide agreement.\n\"For nine months since the EU referendum, there has been no attempt by the UK government to seek a meaningful discussion or agreement with the devolved administrations.\"\nLib Dem leader Tim Farron, who has called for the public to have their say on the terms of exit in a further referendum, said Mrs May's decision to rule out membership of the single market before negotiations began was proof she was pursuing an \"extreme and divisive\" Brexit.\n\"Leaving the single market was not on the ballot paper in the referendum, it is a political choice made by Theresa May,\" he said.\nLater this week, EU leaders will gather in Rome to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which established the European Economic Community - the initial forerunner to the EU. Mrs May is not attending the event.",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects that Theresa May, as Britain's Prime Minister, was expected to make a statement outside 10 Downing Street in London.  While the provided article focuses on her announcement regarding triggering Article 50, it doesn't contradict the caption. The article mentions her plans to make a statement and mentions several instances of her public appearances before and after this event. The time period (November) is not explicitly stated but could be inferred from the timeline of events described in the article. Considering that the article is from BBC news, it represents reliable external evidence.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: The BBC article focuses on Theresa May's announcement on triggering Article 50. Although the exact date of the statement outside 10 Downing Street isn't specified, the article's context strongly suggests that she would make various public statements around the triggering of Article 50.  The article mentions her visits around the UK before triggering Article 50 and implies additional public statements related to this major event. This makes the caption highly probable.",

    "explanation": "The image shows Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street, which aligns with the caption's description of her preparing to make a statement. Internal entity recognition strongly supports the caption's accuracy. External evidence from a BBC news article corroborates that Theresa May made statements outside 10 Downing Street around the time of triggering Article 50, although the exact date isn't specified in the article. The slight uncertainty about the specific date in November reduces the confidence score slightly, but the overall alignment of visual, textual, and external evidence makes the caption highly plausible.",
    "validation_summary": "The caption accurately reflects the image content and is strongly supported by both internal entity recognition and external evidence from a reliable news source.  A minor reduction in confidence score is due to the absence of precise date confirmation in external evidence, though the context strongly suggests the caption's accuracy."

The site includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says: World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\nThe made-up story, though, received more than 500,000 interactions on Facebook, including 47,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. It was also shared on YouTube and 4chan, an open, image-sharing forum, without the disclaimer. Some 4chan users commented that it was fake, but comments by others indicated that some thought it was real.\nThe bogus story states that Elena Travis, who is described as a 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist, officially broke the world record after receiving her 27th abortion. The photos that accompany the story are actually stock photos from Getty Images.\nAside from the misidentified photos and a disclaimer at the bottom of the story, there are other indications that the story is false. There is no byline on the story and the clinic mentioned as performing the historic operation does not seem to exist. A Google search for Sacramento Street Health Center yielded no results.\nWeve written once before about World News Daily Report and have included the website in our Misinformation Directory, which lists websites that spread misinformation on the internet.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\nSources\nA 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist has officially broken a world record after receiving her 27th abortion.

      "explanation": "The news caption is inaccurate and misleading.  FactCheck.org explicitly debunks the story, identifying it as originating from a satirical website, World News Daily Report, that includes a disclaimer stating its content is fictional. The story about Elena Travis receiving 27 abortions and breaking a world record is fabricated. FactCheck.org's analysis points out the use of stock photos, lack of byline, and non-existent clinic mentioned in the original article, further supporting its classification as misinformation.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: FactCheck.org's article, \"No 'World Record' for Abortions\", directly refutes the claim in the news caption. It states that the story is from a satirical website and is entirely false.  The article details the use of stock photos, the absence of a byline, and the non-existence of the mentioned clinic as evidence of the story's fabrication.  FactCheck.org's designation of World News Daily Report as a source of misinformation further supports this conclusion.",

Internal entity check reveals no overlap between the entities and the caption.  Crucially, external validation from FactCheck.org definitively debunks the story. FactCheck.org identifies the source as a satirical website, World News Daily Report, with a disclaimer stating its content is fictional.  The image is a stock photo unrelated to the false claim.  The combination of a demonstrably false caption, non-matching entities, and an image unrelated to the event, and an authoritative external source confirming the misinformation, leads to the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context.",

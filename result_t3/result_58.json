Snopes identifies the source of the claim as a notorious fake news website, Your News Wire, and labels the story as entirely fabricated.  The Snopes article details how the false claim likely played on a music video where Perry was shown being \"prepared\" by chefs, fueling the false narrative.

Internal entity analysis partially supports the presence of Katy Perry, but flags other entities as out of context.  Crucially, external evidence from Snopes definitively debunks the caption's claim, rating it as entirely fabricated by a known fake news website. The Snopes report details how the false claim originated and spread, highlighting its lack of basis.  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably false and out of context.",

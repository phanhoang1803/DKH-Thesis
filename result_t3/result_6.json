        "content": "There are some good arguments for lowering the drinking age from 21: It is unpopular among most young adults; it arguably encourages underground binge drinking; enforcement is a complete failure on college campuses. And it is notable, of course, that an 18-year-old is considered an adult in almost every context -- including in the voting booth -- except when ordering a beer.\nBut research has shown that a drinking age of 21 does reduce alcohol use by those under 21, including high school students. Alcohol consumption by young adults has demonstrable and serious costs: for example, a lower drinking age leads to more traffic fatalities. Indeed, traffic accidents are a primary reason why Vietnam-era experimentation with lower drinking ages was abandoned. Other impacts of lowering the drinking age may be less obvious, but no less costly.\nMy research with Angela Fertig examined the impact of the drinking age by looking back at the 1980s, when many states moved from a minimum of 18 to 21. Our study found that a lower drinking age was associated with a statistically higher risk of unintended pregnancy and, largely as a result, worse infant health.\nResearch by economists Christopher Carpenter and Carlos Dobkin shows that arrest rates for violent and nuisance crimes rise sharply at age 21 and persist through at least age 23. A lower drinking age would likely cause this period of alcohol-related criminal activity to start earlier and last longer. Evidence also suggests that a lower drinking age leads to higher levels of binge drinking later in life among men.\nAny move toward increasing alcohol availability to young adults must consider its adverse effects, including traffic fatalities, unplanned pregnancy and crime. Policies like increased public transit availability, access to birth control and educational initiatives focused on harm reduction rather than abstinence have been shown to mitigate the detrimental effects of alcohol use by young adults. Lowering the drinking age will only succeed as part of a comprehensive set of policies that address the unintended consequences.",

The external evidence focuses on the debate surrounding lowering the drinking age from 21, not raising it to 23.  Therefore, the evidence does not support or refute the caption's claim. The article discusses the consequences of lowering the drinking age to 18,  but offers no information on any changes to the legal drinking age being raised to 23.  There is no information to support the claim that the drinking age was raised to 23.",

The internal check acknowledges a lack of entities to compare against the caption. The external check reveals that sources focus on debates surrounding lowering, not raising the drinking age, providing no support for the caption's statement.  Therefore, there is no visual or textual evidence to support the caption's claim, leading to an out-of-context judgment.",

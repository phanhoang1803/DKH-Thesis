        "content": "Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.\nAlthough recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 50 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.\nHot and windy conditions are forecast to return to many parts of New South Wales this weekend and authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra.\nAt least 33 people have been killed - including four firefighters - and more than 11 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned.\nIf you can't see the map click here.\nNew South Wales and Victoria have been worst affected\nIn the worst-hit state, New South Wales (NSW), fire has affected more than five million hectares, destroying more than 2,000 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere.\nMore than 1,600 firefighters are currently working to slow the spread of fires and shore up containment lines, the NSW Rural Fire Service says.\nFires have raged near the Australian capital Canberra for weeks - at one stage shutting the city's airport as flames approached the perimeter.\nOn Friday, the worst blaze was just south of the district of Tuggeranong, a 20-minute drive south of Parliament House.\nFears are growing that the rising temperatures and strong winds could make the fire uncontrollable. But the NSW Rural Fire Service says it expects most of the flames to spread south east.\nThe State of Emergency declared in Canberra gives extra power and resources to fire authorities, allowing them to force evacuations if necessary.\nVictoria, where fires have burned 1.2 million hectares, extended a \"state of disaster\" for the worst-hit areas from 2 to 11 January.\nSome blazes are still burning in the state and there are emergency warnings are in place.\nThe military has sent troops, ships and aircraft to the region to help relocation and firefighting efforts. Three people - including one firefighter - have died as a result of the fires.\nSouth Australia has also suffered\nTwo people and an estimated 25,000 koalas were killed when flames devastated Kangaroo Island in the state of South Australia on 9 January.\nThe island is renowned for its unique mix of animal species - and there are fears it may never recover.\nExperts have expressed concerns over the survival of endangered species on the island which include the dunnart - a mouse-like marsupial - and the black glossy cockatoo.\nTens of thousands of farm animals, mainly sheep, were also killed in the fire on the island.\nVideos posted on social media showed efforts to rescue koalas which survived the blazes.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

As we were unable to establish a confirmed death toll for these fires, they were not included in this graphic.\nIf there is a serious risk of fire reaching homes or properties, authorities urge people to leave in good time as fire can travel fast - faster than most people can run.\nSo is this down to climate change?\nMany Australians are asking that very question - but the science is complicated.\nScientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense. Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow.\nData shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says.\nAustralia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C.\nBy the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland.\nA climate phenomenon is behind the heatwave\nThe main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east.\nAndrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave.\n\"The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,\" he says.\n\"A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country.\"",

        "title": "Setting the Record Straight on Climate Change and Arson in Australia's Bushfires",
        "date": "2020-01-17T22:23:27",
        "content": "For example, a video from the conservative content generator PragerU has been viewed 2 million times since it was posted on Jan. 7. The text in the video claims: The popular narrative is that Australias fires are caused by climate change. But the facts say otherwise Since November 8, 2019, nearly 200 arsonists have been arrested for starting brush fires in Australia. The arsonists were responsible for about 50% of the bushfires. Not climate change. Arsonists. Repeat that: Not climate change. Arsonists. But the left doesnt care, because this fact doesnt agree with their science.'\nHeres what the video gets wrong: First of all, nearly 200 arsonists havent been arrested since Nov. 8, 2019.\nAs its source, the video cites a Jan. 7 story from Rupert Murdochs newspaper the Australian with the headline: Bushfires: Firebugs fuelling crisis as arson arrest toll hits 183.\nThe story said that police arrested 183 people for lighting bushfires across Queensland, NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in the past few months. But that total of 183 arson arrests occurred over various periods in 2019, including all of 2019 in the case of Victoria.\nThe story also referenced statistics since Nov. 8, 2019, from only one state  New South Wales. Police there announced that they had taken legal action against 183 people for bushfire-related offenses. Only 24 of those people were charged for alleged deliberately-lit bushfires, according to the police; others were cautioned or charged with different offenses.\nSo, the video used the date from the New South Wales announcement and the number of arson arrests counted over five states and various periods in 2019 from the newspaper story. The effect is an inflated number of arrests since the bushfires began.\nThe larger point in the video, though, is that arson is primarily responsible for the bushfires in Australia, not climate change. That message has been distilled into online memes. It also has been trumpeted by some high-profile political figures, including Donald Trump Jr.\nBut overemphasizing the role of arson and pitting it against climate change distorts the issue.\nThe fact is, hot, dry conditions allow for bushfires to escalate, regardless of how they are started. As we explained in 2017, in a story about wildfires in the western U.S., climate change doesnt cause these fires, but it can exacerbate the hot and dry conditions that make wildfires more likely to develop and grow.\nGenerally, about half of all bushfires are started by natural causes (mostly from lightning), according to Geoscience Australia, a government agency that deals with geology and geography. The other half are caused by people, who start them either accidentally or deliberately. Those that are started deliberately arent necessarily malicious, according to the agency. They could be fires that were meant to be contained, but got out of control.\nThe videos claim that half of the current fires are due to arson is also wrong.\nThat figure appears to be based on another part of the story in the Australian, which said about 50 per cent of bushfires were lit by firebugs and impending fire seasons excited them. It attributed that statement to James Ogloff, a professor of forensic behavioral science.\nWe reached out to Ogloff and asked for the source of that figure. He said it came from a 2008 Australian Institute of Criminology report. But that report, more than a decade old, analyzed only fires that were assigned a cause  13% of those fires were deliberate and 37% were suspicious. It doesnt account for at least 40% of all fires that werent assigned a cause.\nSo we asked Colleen Bryant, the researcher who wrote that 2008 report, if her findings could support the claim that 50% of the current fires are attributable to arson. The short answer is, no. But she also provided to us a 14-page explanation of the current circumstances, which can be read here.\nThe original report is neither a study of bushfires nor arson, she explained. Rather, it is an examination of deliberately lit vegetation fires.\nVegetation fire is a broad category that covers any fire occurring in vegetation, whereas a bushfire is larger, akin to a wildfire. There are many more vegetation fires than bushfires.\nAnd deliberately lit fires arent necessarily arson. They, too, are a broad category that can include arson, but also include suspicious, nuisance and other types of fire ignitions, where the cause of the fire is not conclusive.\nThe original report is based largely on data kept over a four- to five-year period in the late 1990s and early 2000s by various state agencies, but not all fires are recorded. Some of the largest bushfires in northern Australias wilderness are not attended, so they wouldnt be part of that data, for example.\nBased on her analysis of the available fire statistics, Bryant concluded that most of those very large bushfires have a natural origin, and they account for the overwhelming majority of all land burned.",

Hundred of rare koalas are also reported dead among them. Lets pray for Australia Source: University of sydney report #wildfire.\" The Facebook page also has as its cover image a separate photo that shows a kangaroo rushing past a burning house on Dec. 31; that picture was legitimately captured in New South Wales, Australia, by photojournalist Matthew Abbott.\nThe University of Sydney estimated Jan. 3 that 480 million animals have been killed in the New South Wales bushfires since September 2019.\nThe tiger image, however, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe found that the photo is several years old, was not taken in Australia and does not show animals killed in a fire.\nThe image is from 2012 and depicts a bonfire of confiscated taxidermy animals in Jakarta, Indonesia. (Several commenters on the multi-photo post also said that some of the other images are from other fires, as well).\nTrading in or being in possession of protected animals or their body parts is a criminal offense in Indonesia, and animal traffickers can face up to five years in jail and fines up to $10,000 USD.\nJakarta officials seized 258 animal remains in the 2012 raid, according to an article by the Daily Mail, which included 15 tigers, 2 sun bears and 48 deer, before destroying them. The animals had all been killed by poachers before being stuffed and sold to be displayed in peoples homes.",

      "explanation": "The caption \"Australia is burning, but is it this bad?\" is accurate in its broad assertion that Australia experienced severe bushfires, but requires qualification concerning the severity.  Source 1 (BBC) provides substantial evidence of widespread and devastating fires, reporting extensive hectares burned, property damage, fatalities, and significant air pollution. However, this source also acknowledges that while the 2019-2020 season was exceptionally severe, Australia has historically experienced bushfires. Source 2 (FactCheck.org) challenges claims that arson is the primary cause, emphasizing the role of hot, dry conditions exacerbated by climate change in increasing the risk and intensity of wildfires.  The caption's implication of uncertainty regarding the severity is thus supported by the fact that the 2019-2020 bushfires, while exceptionally damaging, were not unprecedented in Australian history. The caption does not make any false claims, and source 3 does not pertain to this question directly. The BBC is a reputable news organization; FactCheck.org is a well-known fact-checking site and helps put context and perspective to the narrative. The overall assessment suggests the caption is accurate but incomplete without a more detailed account of the historical context of Australian bushfires.",

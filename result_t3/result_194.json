        "content": "TBR\nInside the List\nANNE AND NICK: Anne Tyler's new novel, ''Digging to America'' (Knopf), is No. 6 on this week's hardcover fiction list -- but in independent bookstores, it's No. 1. Tyler is reclusive, and while she isn't touring behind her new novel, she did recently answer a handful of questions put to her by readers of The Daily Telegraph of London. Tyler said she was inspired to write ''Digging to America,'' which is partly about an Iranian family in the United States, because her late husband was Iranian. ''For 44 years,'' she said, ''his very large and complicated family has been giving me a close look at what it means to be foreign -- to view America from the outside, to attempt to 'dig' one's way inside.'' Nick Hornby once called Tyler the English language's greatest living novelist, and the admiration is mutual. '' 'High Fidelity' was one of the few books in my life that surprised me,'' Tyler said. ''It was so original and seemingly uncalculated. But I wouldn't be a writer at all if I hadn't read Eudora Welty. Her short stories convinced me that the ordinary, small-town Southern life I was living was a fit subject for literature. Nowadays, I'm enjoying writers who are just emerging: Nicole Krauss, Dana Spiotta, Lara Vapnyar. Their work has so much energy, and they take a lot of risks.''\nBy Dwight Garner\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES; Leaving a Life but Not Quite Escaping\nLADDER OF YEARS By Anne Tyler 326 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24. Anne Tyler's comically touching new novel, \"Ladder of Years,\" begins with a one-page newspaper story headlined \"Baltimore Woman Disappears During Family Vacation.\" The article begins, \"Delaware State Police announced early today that Cordelia F. Grinstead, 40, wife of a Roland Park physician, has been reported missing while on holiday with her family in Bethany Beach.\" It goes on to say that Mrs. Grinstead was last seen walking south along the beach by her husband, Dr. Samuel Grinstead, 55, and her three children, Susan, 21; Ramsey, 19, and Carroll, 15. It adds, \"Her failure to return was not remarked until late afternoon.\"\nBy Christopher Lehmann-Haupt\nReview/Theater; Adapting an Anne Tyler Novel\nIf the sheer emotional weight of family, with all its burdens of love and pain and responsibility and memory, could somehow be represented by a single stage set, it could certainly look like Kevin Rigdon's design for \"Earthly Possessions,\" the new play Frank Galati has adapted from Anne Tyler's novel for the Steppenwolf Theater Company. Mr. Rigdon has taken the possessions of the title -- the household furnishings of Ms. Tyler's heroine, Charlotte Emory of Clarion, Md. -- and piled them high on either side of the stage. The furnishings are clunky lamps, overstuffed chairs, tables, console radios and cabinets of the most comforting sort, the ubiquitous garage-sale totems of every American neighborhood, but Mr. Rigdon has subverted their familiarity by painting them a disconcerting coal-black. And rising above the stage, towering clear to heaven, is a wall of equally homey front doors and back doors and screens and shutters, all just as black, all just as ambivalent in effect. Is the American family a warm place to come home to, Mr. Rigdon's monumental collage seems to ask, or is it a dark tomb that must at all costs be escaped?\nBy Frank Rich\nBooks of The Times; Love, Guilt and Change in a Family\nSaint Maybe By Anne Tyler 337 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $22. To followers of this author's novels, members of the Bedloe family will be instantly recognizable as Anne Tyler creations. This family of likable eccentrics lives, of course, in Baltimore, and to outside eyes, it comes across as the neighborhood's \"version of the ideal, apple-pie household: two amiable parents, three good-looking children, a dog, a cat, a scattering of goldfish.\" Claudia, the oldest of the children, has recently married and started a family of her own. Danny has just announced his engagement to a pretty young woman named Lucy. And Ian, the youngest, has \"crowds of loyal friends\" and \"the prettiest girl in the junior class\" as his sweetheart.\nBy Michiko Kakutani\nDANGER, DEFIANCE AND SURVIVAL\n* I Will Call It Georgie's Blues By Suzanne Newton. 197 pp. New York: The Viking Presss $12.95 (Ages 11 to 15) If the Georgie of ''I Will Call It Georgie's Blues'' has any close relation, it's John Henry West, Frankie's little cousin in ''The Member of the Wedding.'' Seven year-old Georgie is equally touching, but in many ways more fragile, and his presence in this story turns it into something fine and delicate and full of possiblility.\nBy Anne Tyler\nTHE LEDFORDS AND ALL OF US\nGENERATIONS An American Family. By John Egerton. Illustrated. 263 pp. Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky. $19.50 THIS is still a new country, hard as that may be to keep in mind. It's so new that some of our oldest citizens can personally recall people who were present at the nation's beginnings. It should be possible, therefore, to latch onto a chain of memories leading directly back to our earliest days - a thought that first occurred to John Egerton during our bicentennial year. The author of several books of social history, including ''Nashville: The Faces of Two Centuries'' and ''The Americanization of Dixie,'' Mr. Egerton wondered whether any couple existed both old enough and lucid enough to paint a living portrait of our most distant past. And if this couple were a representative one, with the usual fanning out of descendants, wouldn't their family saga read like a biography of America itself?\nAnne Tyler",

The internal check finds no entities to verify, while the external check reveals no evidence of a photographer named Tyler taking photos of families in South Tyneside.  The New York Times articles about Anne Tyler are irrelevant.  Therefore, there is no supporting evidence for the caption's claim. The visual evidence alone is insufficient for validation, given the lack of external corroboration.",

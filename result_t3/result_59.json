    "explanation": "The image clearly shows a large billboard in Piccadilly Circus, London, displaying a tribute to Captain Sir Tom Moore.  The internal entity check correctly identifies the location and person, aligning with the image content. The external check confirms the plausibility of the event described in the caption, given Captain Tom Moore's public profile and the common use of Piccadilly Circus for large-scale tributes.  While there's no direct source for the image, the strong internal and external checks, combined with the visual evidence, make the caption highly probable. The knowledge-based assessment contributes, but its limitations are acknowledged.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal and external validation both support the caption's accuracy. The image directly visualizes the described tribute. While relying on some knowledge-based assessment, the overall evidence strongly suggests the caption is in context."

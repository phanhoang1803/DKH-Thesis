        "date": "2020-04-10T05:24:22",
        "content": "Claim:\nBill Gates is being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations.\nDuring the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020, a popular social media meme asserted that philanthropist Bill Gates was partnered with business magnate George Soros in owning a lab in Wuhan, China (the presumed location where the COVID-19 outbreak originated), and was being sued by India over the deaths of girls resulting from vaccinations:\nIt is true that the Microsoft co-founder, through his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has expended billions of dollars funding research and childhood-immunization programs in developing countries. Gates, who has long warned that we are inadequately prepared to deal with global pandemics, has also pledged to make billions of dollars available for funding the manufacture of vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a member of the Leadership Council for the Gates Foundation's Decade of Vaccines Collaboration effort launched in 2010.\nHowever, the meme jumps the rails at suggesting anything more than that Gates is interested in improving lives through medical research and vaccinations.\nGates does not own a lab in Wuhan, China, in partnership with Soros; that claim is a combination of two separate and false rumors that we have already debunked at length: that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was deliberately engineered as a bioweapon, and that Soros owns the laboratory in Wuhan where the alleged development of the virus supposedly took place.\nThe rumor that \"India is suing Bill Gates because he vaccinated 77,000 third world girls between the ages of 9 & 15 and many of them died\" is also a false one that we have explored at length. This claim is not directly connected to Gates or the Gates Foundation, but rather to the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), which conducted a study beginning in 2009 to see if it could reduce the number of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. (The Gates Foundation was one of PATH's global partners and reportedly provided funding for its HPV study.) The study caused controversy in India when seven of the girls involved in the trial in that country died after receiving their vaccines, but state investigations found those deaths were unrelated to the vaccinations:\nState investigations absolved the trial's managers  PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi  of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was \"very unlikely\" to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as \"unlikely.\" ICMR's director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: \"Based on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,\" he insists.",

Gates children have been vaccinated, according to his former wife, Melinda French Gates. The photo, taken in 1998 for the World Health Organization, shows children with polio in Sierra Leone.\nTHE FACTS: Social media users this week are sharing old, false claims about billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates to question his work around vaccines.\nA post circulating on Instagram shared two false claims  one about Gates children and another about a vaccine program in Africa.\nThe first part of the post claims that Gates own children have never been vaccinated.\nAs The Associated Press has previously reported, French Gates debunked this claim on Facebook in 2019.\nAll three of my children are fully vaccinated, she said in a Facebook post addressing World Immunization Week. Vaccines work. And when fewer people decide to get them, we all become more vulnerable to disease.\nThe post also includes a photo of children in Sierra Leone, and falsely claims they were crippled by vaccines.\nThe post is captioned: Look at what he did to the people in Africa.\nHowever, the photo shows children with polio who were not vaccinated against the disease. The photo was taken by French photographer Jean-Marc Giboux in 1998 and was commissioned by the World Health Organization to document the effects of polio in Sierra Leone due to the lack of vaccination.\nI shot this picture in 1998 in Sierra Leone, Giboux told the AP in a 2020 email. They were kids in a center for children affected with polio, and it was during the Sierra Leone civil war.\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has long been dedicated to promoting access to vaccines around the world and has recently worked to fund coronavirus treatments and vaccine distribution.\n___\nThis is part of APs effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.",

        "date": "2020-05-29T23:37:00",
        "content": "Speculation about a future coronavirus vaccine is ramping up and social-media posts from anti-vaccination campaigners are gaining more traction online.\nWe've been debunking a few recent claims.\nWhy the microchip rumours don't stack up\nFirst up, a conspiracy theory about vaccines that has spanned the globe.\nIt claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it.\nWe've found no evidence to support these claims.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was \"false\".\nThe head of the Russian Communist party this week said that so-called \"globalists\" supported \"a covert mass chip implantation which they may in time resort to under the pretext of a mandatory vaccination against coronavirus\".\nHe didn't mention Mr Gates by name but in the US, Roger Stone, a former adviser to Donald Trump, said Bill Gates and others were using the virus for \"microchipping people so we can tell 'whether you've been tested'.\"\nA new YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggests that 28% of Americans believe that Bill Gates wants to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans.\nRumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually \"we will have some digital certificates\" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips.\nThat response led to one widely shared article, under the headline: \"Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus\".\nThe article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection.\nHowever, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says: \"The reference to 'digital certificates' relates to efforts to create an open-source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe, home-based testing.\"\nBill Gates did not say this about a vaccine\nThe Microsoft billionaire has been the target of many different false rumours about vaccines.\nA recent post on a UK-based Twitter account said: \"Bill Gates admits the vaccine will no doubt kill 700,000 people\" and links to a video featuring right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\nThe claim in the tweet, which has had more than 45,000 retweets and likes, is false and misrepresents Gates' words.\nIn the video, Mr Gates is talking about the efficacy of vaccines in older people and cautions about the risk of side-effects.\nHe sets out a hypothetical situation about the potential harm of side-effects, saying:\"If we have one in 10,000 side-effects, that's way more... 700,000 people who will suffer from that.\"\nHe does not \"admit\" 700,000 will die from a vaccine.\nConspiracy theories about Bill Gates have reached the Italian Parliament, where an independent MP called for Bill Gates to be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\nPandemic for profit?\nThere is a strong anti-vaccination movement in Italy.\nOne popular Italian video, which has been viewed more than 700,000 times on Facebook, has a caption claiming that the pandemic has been \"invented\".\nThe narrator of the clip is Stefano Montanari, an Italian researcher with a degree in pharmacology, who claims the end goal is to get everyone vaccinated.\nHe argues that the epidemic \"will continue to be totally made-up\" until there is a vaccine that \"will bring money and corruption into the already full pockets of some\".\nHe concludes: \"This is a sensational hoax, but a very successful one.\"\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to support his theory that the pandemic is a hoax. It is true that whichever pharmaceutical company develops a vaccine could potentially profit from the success, but the idea that this potential profit would be a motive to invent a pandemic is far-fetched.\nCow-dung vaccine?\nA Facebook meme announcing a \"wonder drug to battle corona\" and a \"cow-dung vaccine\" has been shared widely on Facebook in India.\nSome of the posts, including one shared more than 1,000 times, link to a front-page story from the Ahmedabad Mirror, which reports that a trial of medicine derived from cow's milk, butter, ghee, dung and urine is under way.\nThe cow is considered sacred in Hinduism and some Hindu groups have claimed that drinking cow urine could boost immunity against the virus - a claim we've looked at before.\nHowever, there is no scientific evidence to support this theory, and the trial described in the Ahmedabad Mirror does not mention testing cow dung as a vaccine or prophylactic treatment.\nThe article quotes a doctor as saying: \"Cow urine is known to have medicinal components that can cure Covid-19.\" In fact there is no known cure for coronavirus.\nAdditional reporting by Laura Gozzi, Shruti Menon, Olga Robinson and Shayan Sardarizadeh.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions",

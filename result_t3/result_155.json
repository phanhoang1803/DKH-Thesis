        "content": "Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

      "explanation": "The news caption \"Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\" is FALSE.  Snopes.com fact-checks this claim, revealing that the images of the purple lobster circulating online were digitally manipulated.

    "explanation": "The internal check, lacking entities for comparison, defaults to a true verdict. However, the external check from Snopes.com decisively refutes the caption.  Snopes reveals the image was digitally manipulated; the lobsterman himself confirmed it was a Photoshop joke. While purple lobsters are theoretically possible, no credible evidence supports the claim of such a large purple lobster catch in Maine.  The visual evidence shows a clearly manipulated image, aligning with the external evidence's conclusion that the caption is false. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check yields a true verdict due to lack of entities. However, strong external evidence from Snopes.com and visual inspection reveals the image as a digitally manipulated hoax, resulting in an overall false verdict."

While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as \"making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,\" this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton's impeachment.\nThis tweet does not appear on Lewinsky's official Twitter timeline. We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well.\nWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted.\nThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with \"Twitter for Android.\" Lewinksy's tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone.",

        "content": "Amid the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, a screenshot of a salacious fake tweet attributed to Monica Lewinsky is circulating on Facebook.\nThe fabricated tweet makes it appear that Lewinsky, a central figure in the 1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice and lying under oath, made a sexually suggestive comment involving Trump, oral sex and her interest in seeing Trump impeached. Clintons impeachment charge stemmed from a sexual harassment case, in which Lewinsky, then a White House intern, became famously intertwined following an independent councils investigation into sexual encounters between Lewinsky and Clinton.\nThe viral image in question displays Lewinskys real Twitter profile picture and handle. It makes it look like she authored a tweet time-stamped at 6:06 p.m. on Oct. 3, with 1,610 retweets and over 18,000 likes, that read:\n\"Im willing to take one for (sic) team and give Trump a b****** in the oval office. Apparently, thats the only thing that can convince Republicans to impeach.\"\nThe screenshot was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNo, this is not a real tweet written by Monica Lewinsky.\nThe fake tweet appears to have been created by Instagram user @electorotting  the handle appears in the upper right hand corner of the tweets image. A visit to that Instagram profile shows the Lewinsky tweet and several other fabricated tweets and other memes. The same persons Twitter bio tells people to follow them on Instagram for \"original memes.\" In 2018, the user admitted to the Associated Press that he was responsible for creating a fake tweet made to look like it came from President Barack Obamas verified account.\nPolitiFact reached out to @electorotting but didnt immediately receive a response.\nThere is no sign of the tweet on Lewinskys Twitter profile page. She tweeted multiple times on Oct. 3, but none mentioned impeachment or anything sexually suggestive.\nWe also searched Lewinskys Twitter handle @MonicaLewinsky in the All My Tweets database, which compiles users tweets in a single webpage, and could not find anything from Lewinsky on Oct. 3  as the screenshot shows  that references impeachment, Trump or oral sex.\nAnother red flag demonstrating that the tweet is fabricated: An advanced Twitter search of its keywords came up with (almost) no results. For a viral tweet that has supposedly garnered thousands of retweets and likes, only one similarly-worded tweet from a user who isnt Lewinsky showed up on the platform.\nWe reached out to Lewinsky for comment, but havent yet heard back.\nWe know enough, though, to rate this faux tweet Pants on Fire!",

Both sources definitively debunk this claim, stating that the tweet circulating online is fabricated.  The evidence clearly shows the claim is false, highlighting inconsistencies like the tweet's origin, the lack of it on Lewinsky's official Twitter, and the use of different devices for the alleged tweet compared to Lewinsky's usual posting habits.

        "content": "A British-Ghanaian photographer, whose images captured major social and political changes in London and Accra during the 1950s and 1960s, is having his work exhibited on Piccadilly Circus's big screens, as part of a major retrospective.\nJames Barnor's work will be displayed at 20:21 BST, for 150 seconds, every night throughout April, followed by an exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in May.\nDespite a photography career lasting more than six decades, the 91-year-old became widely known only after an exhibition at the Black Cultural Archives in 2007.\nBorn in 1929 in Accra, Barnor worked as a photojournalist before establishing the Ever Young portrait studio in the Ghanaian capital.\nHis photography during the 1950s captured the nation as it moved towards independence.\nIn 1959, Barnor moved to London to study photography and further develop his skills.\nIn the UK he worked on assignments for South Africa's Drum magazine, often shooting cover images of black fashion models against London backdrops.\nHis photography also captured the experiences of London's burgeoning African diaspora.\nBarnor returned to Ghana in the 1970s, where he established the country's first colour processing lab while continuing his work as a portrait photographer.\nHe relocated again to London in the 1990s.\nFollowing the 2007 exhibition at the Black Cultural Archives, Barnor's work was featured in a number of international exhibitions and gradually became more widely recognised.\nReflecting on his career, Barnor says: \"I [once] came across a magazine with an inscription that said, 'A civilisation flourishes when men plant trees under which they never sit.'\n\"But it's not only plants - putting something in somebody's life, a young person's life, is the same as planting a tree that you will not cut and sell.\n\"That has helped me a lot in my work - sometimes, the more you give, the more you get.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption stating that Erlin Ibreck was a drum cover model in Trafalgar Square, London in 1966 is partially supported by the provided evidence.  The evidence mentions James Barnor, a photographer working for Drum magazine in London during the 1960s, shooting cover images of black fashion models against London backdrops. While it doesn't explicitly name Erlin Ibreck, it establishes the context of a Black fashion model being photographed for Drum magazine covers in London during the specified time period. The lack of direct mention of Erlin Ibreck and the specific location (Trafalgar Square) makes a definitive judgment difficult.  The evidence is reliable as it comes from a BBC article about a renowned photographer. However, it doesn't offer a complete confirmation of the caption's details. Therefore, while the overall context is plausible based on the evidence, we cannot definitively verify all aspects of the caption.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a Black woman in a 1960s-style dress feeding pigeons in Trafalgar Square, London. The caption identifies her as Erlin Ibreck, a drum cover model.  Internal validation finds no misalignment because no entities were provided for comparison. However, external validation, based on a BBC article about photographer James Barnor, suggests that Barnor photographed Black fashion models for Drum magazine in London during the 1960s. While this aligns with the image's context, the external evidence does not explicitly confirm that the woman pictured is Erlin Ibreck, nor does it definitively state she was a \"drum cover model.\" Therefore, the caption's claim is not fully substantiated. Although the overall context is plausible, the lack of direct evidence confirming all aspects of the caption leads to a conclusion of \"out of context.\"",

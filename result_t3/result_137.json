While the caption does not explicitly name the governor, Jerry Brown is a plausible candidate given his past role as Governor of California.  Without confirmation that Jerry Brown is the governor under investigation in the given news caption, I cannot say with absolute certainty.

        "content": "Claim:\nCalifornia's governor is under investigation for possible corruption.\nOn 17 April 2017, the web site consjournal.com published a story purporting to link California Governor Jerry Brown to a corruption investigation.\nHowever, the story didn't stand up to the barest of scrutiny. The headline said that Brown was \"caught in the middle of a $60 billion corruption investigation,\" a premise that is undermined by the sources it cites, each of which states that Brown ordered the probe into the state Board of Equalization  but he was not the subject of the investigation.\nOne of those sources, a March 2017 Sacramento Bee story, identifies the focus of the identification, which was spurred in part by an audit of the department:\nThe reports authors say they found well-paid tax auditors on parking lot duty at a promotional event, a steep rise in spending on activities that do not appear connected to taxes, and misleading information provided to lawmakers.\nThe audit takes particular aim at board member Jerome Horton, finding that he has reassigned public employees to work for him, arranged events that strayed from the agencys mission and opened a call center in his district without securing the consent of his fellow elected leaders. Horton has defended his outreach events as a way to reach large numbers of taxpayers.\nThe following month, Brown asked the state Justice Department to investigate the department, which collects an estimated $60 billion a year from more than 30 types of taxes, including fuel for motor vehicles and jets; alcoholic beverage taxes; and taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products, among others. It functions independently of the state Franchise Tax Board, which collects personal income taxes, and the Employment Development Department, which focuses on payroll taxes.\nA separate audit conducted in November 2015 found that board staffers incorrectly sent nearly $47.8 million in taxes to the state general fund. California State Controller Betty Yee undertook the review after noticing \"irregularities\" in the fund.\nBesides ordering an investigation into the board, Brown said in a letter to its members that he had barred it from hiring \"key personnel\", and restricted its ability to issue contracts without outside approval.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that California's governor is under investigation for possible corruption. The external evidence from Snopes.com focuses on an investigation into the California State Board of Equalization, which was initiated by then-Governor Jerry Brown.  While Brown ordered the investigation, the evidence explicitly states that he was not the subject of it. The investigation concerned potential corruption within the Board itself, not Governor Brown. Therefore, the caption is misleading; it implies the Governor is the subject of the corruption investigation, which is not supported by the reliable evidence provided. ",

    "explanation": "The image shows Jerry Brown, who was the governor of California.  The caption states that California's governor is under investigation for possible corruption. However, external evidence from Snopes.com reveals that while Governor Brown ordered an investigation into the California State Board of Equalization for potential corruption, he was not himself under investigation. Therefore, the caption is misleading, implying that Governor Brown was the subject of the investigation, which is not supported by reliable evidence. The internal check acknowledges the uncertainty due to the caption's lack of explicit naming of the governor, but the external evidence decisively contradicts the caption's implication.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds a plausible link between the image and caption but lacks definitive proof. External evidence from Snopes.com refutes the caption's claim, indicating the governor was not the subject of the investigation, hence, out of context."

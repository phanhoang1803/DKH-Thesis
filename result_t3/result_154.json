        "content": "Claim:\nAn episode of \"The Simpsons\" predicted that U.S. President Donald Trump would cancel his trip to Denmark after the prime minister refused to sell Greenland to the United States.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nThe animated show \"The Simpsons\" has garnered a reputation for \"predicting\" future events during the course of its nearly 30-year run. While a few odd coincidences exist, Simpsons prediction hoaxes may outnumber actual Simpsons predictions.\nFor example, \"The Simpsons\" did not predict that U.S. President Donald Trump would ride down an escalator while announcing his bid for president; Lady Gaga's Superbowl halftime show; the video game Pokemon Go; the fire at Notre Dame cathedral; a mass shooting during a screening of \"Black Panther\"; Trump's touching a glowing orb; or Trump's death.\nIn August 2019, after Trump mulled the idea of buying Greenland and then announced that he was canceling a trip to the area after Denmark's prime minister rejected the idea, another Simpsons \"prediction\" started to circulate on social media.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a message on Twitter about how the animated show had predicted the kerfuffle.\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow made a similar joke on Twitter:\nWhile these tweets were likely posted in jest, some people didn't quite get the joke. At least two threads were started on \"The Simpsons\" section of Reddit asking if the prediction was real, and multiple people chimed in on Twitter about the show's uncanny ability to tell the future. Murphy's tweet was also shared on Fark as proof that \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening had a time machine.\nWe searched Frinkiac, a website named after the Simpsons' bumbling mad-scientist character Professor Frink. The site allows fans to search the show's archives for favorite quotes and jokes. And nothing surfaced for mentions of the words \"Greenland,\" \"Trump,\" and \"Denmark\" together.\nFurthermore, we've previously covered the show's \"predictions\" about Trump's presidency. And as far as we can tell, the first mention of a \"President Trump\" came during the season 11 episode, \"Bart to the Future,\" in 2000. Trump was mentioned in prior seasons, but never as president or a potential buyer of Greenland:",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article provides strong evidence that contradicts the news caption.  Snopes explicitly rates the claim as false, citing a lack of evidence within the Simpsons archives and highlighting the frequent exaggeration of the show's predictive abilities.  The article examines specific instances of claimed predictions that were later proven false, demonstrating the prevalence of misleading interpretations and the need for verification. The article also points out that while Trump was mentioned in older seasons of The Simpsons, he was never depicted as president or as considering the purchase of Greenland. Therefore, the news caption's assertion is unsubstantiated.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on the presence of relevant entities. However, the external check, using Snopes, strongly refutes the claim, stating it's false and providing evidence showing no such prediction exists in \"The Simpsons\" archives.  The image shows Matt Groening holding a Simpsons pillow, which is irrelevant to the claim's validity. The external evidence is much stronger than the internal check, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",

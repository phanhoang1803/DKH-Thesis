      "explanation": "The caption's plausibility hinges on the assumption that Sri Lanka's government would resort to advertising for a hangman, which, while unusual, isn't entirely implausible given bureaucratic processes and potential skill shortages.  The claim about the president's stance on capital punishment is plausible given the global variation in death penalty attitudes. However, there is uncertainty about whether this specific method of recruitment would be employed.  The absence of corroborating news reports lowers confidence.",
      "supporting_points": "Sri Lanka has a history of using capital punishment (though it may not be consistently implemented). Governments often use public channels for recruitment.  Advertising for specialized roles, especially those with ethical implications, might be less common but not illogical.",

    "confidence_score": 3,
    "explanation": "The image shows a person reading a newspaper's classifieds section, focusing on employment opportunities. This is completely unrelated to the caption's claim about Sri Lanka seeking a hangman through want ads.  The internal check fails to find the named locations within the caption. The external check acknowledges some plausibility in the caption's core idea (advertising for unusual roles) but lacks direct evidence, resulting in a low confidence score. The discrepancy between the image and the caption is significant. There's no visual support for the caption's content.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check: No support. External check: Low confidence. Visual evidence: Direct contradiction. The caption is out of context."

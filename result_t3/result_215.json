      "explanation": "The provided news caption cannot be verified or refuted based on the external evidence. The evidence is an image gallery submission page from the BBC Scotland news website, which does not contain information about Joe, Joshua, a rainbow, or any expressions of support for the NHS.  Therefore, there is no basis for evaluating the accuracy of the caption using the provided source.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 5,
    "explanation": "The image shows two children looking at a rainbow painted on a wooden fence. While the image aligns with some aspects of the caption (children, rainbow), there is no evidence to support the names \"Joe\" and \"Joshua\", nor the claim of the rainbow being in support of the NHS. The external evidence corroborates this lack of supporting information. Therefore, significant parts of the caption lack support from both visual and external evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "The internal check defaults to true due to a lack of entities for comparison. However, the external check reveals a significant mismatch, concluding that the caption is likely out of context because crucial information within the caption lacks support from both the image and external sources."

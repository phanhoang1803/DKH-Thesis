        "date": "2021-05-15T03:47:24",
        "content": "A US envoy has arrived in Tel Aviv for de-escalation talks as unrest between Israel and the Palestinians continues.\nHady Amr will take part in talks with Israeli, Palestinian and UN officials and reinforce what US diplomats said was the need for a \"sustainable calm\".\nAn Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip killed 10 people on Saturday, while a Palestinian rocket killed a man in Israel.\nThis week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014.\nUS President Joe Biden made diplomatic phone calls to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. The international community has urged both sides to end the escalation.\nAt least 139 people have been killed in Gaza and nine in Israel since this fighting began on Monday. Israel says dozens of militants are among the dead in Gaza, while Palestinian health officials say nearly half are women and children.\nThe flare-up of violence over the last six days came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem, which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.\nHow did the fighting escalate on Saturday?\nThirteen people died in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, with 10 killed by an Israeli air strike at a refugee camp west of Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said.\nA five-month-old baby is said to be the only survivor of that strike, found trapped in the rubble next to his dead mother. A number of people were also reported missing.\nAkram Farouq, 36, dashed out of his home in Gaza along with his family after a neighbour told him they had received a call from an Israeli officer warning their building would be hit, Reuters news agency reports.\n\"We haven't slept all night because of the explosions, and now I am out in the street with my wife and children, who are weeping and trembling,\" he said.\nAn estimated 10,000 Palestinians have left their homes in Gaza since Monday because of the conflict, according to the UN.\nSaturday also saw an Israeli air strike destroy a tower block in Gaza housing media organisations. No-one is known to have died in this attack.\nIsraeli officials reported about 200 rocket launches from Gaza overnight, with homes hit in the southern cities of Ashdod, Beersheba and Sderot.\nIn Beersheba, 19 people were taken to hospital after getting slightly hurt while running to shelters, and three suffered from shock, The Times of Israel reports.\nIn the afternoon, a rocket hit a street in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, killing a man. He was reportedly hit by shrapnel in his apartment.\nAbout 2,300 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel since Monday, with about 1,000 intercepted by missile defences and 380 falling short and dropping into Gaza itself, Israel's military says.\nThere had been concerns of heightened tensions on Saturday as Palestinians were commemorating what they call al-Nakba, the Catastrophe. It marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced or driven from their homes in the Arab-Israeli war, which began the day after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948.\nWhat happened to the Gaza tower block?\nOn Saturday afternoon, an Israeli air strike destroyed a high-rise building housing media organisations, including The Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, plus a number of offices and apartments.\nIn a statement released shortly afterwards, the Israeli military said the building housed military assets belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. The building's landlord has denied this.\nThe Associated Press (AP) said the block was hit roughly an hour after Israeli forces ordered people to evacuate.\nThe news organisation's CEO, Gary Pruitt, said: \"This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life. A dozen AP journalists and freelancers were inside the building and thankfully we were able to evacuate them in time.\"\nWhat is the US envoy seeking to achieve?\nMr Amr's arrival comes ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on Sunday. The US embassy in Israel said the aim of his trip was to \"reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm\".\nMr Biden's administration has had to rapidly step up its game on the diplomatic front without a full team in place: there is not even a nominee yet for ambassador to Israel.\nMr Amr is a mid-level diplomat without the kind of rank held by special envoys in previous US administrations, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says.\nBoth sides need to be able to say they've won\nThe end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007.\nForeign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now.\nFor that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won.\nHamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem.\nIsrael will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is \"restore deterrence\". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

The provided evidence focuses on the Israeli-Gaza conflict, reporting deaths from air strikes and rocket attacks.

    "explanation": "The internal check shows some alignment between the image and caption, but the external evidence strongly contradicts the caption's claims. The image depicts police officers with firearms, which is consistent with the caption mentioning the use of force. However, external evidence points to a completely different event (the Israel-Gaza conflict) that does not involve the stated crowd control methods or the death of a bystander from police action.  The significant discrepancy between the visual, internal, and external evidence leads to a low confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is out of context.",

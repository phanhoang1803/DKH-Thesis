        "content": "When I last visited Damascus in 2008, the historic Old City district was full of Western students learning Arabic. Before bloody conflicts engulfed them, both Damascus and the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, were favorites with foreigners seeking to learn Arabic.\nEight years ago, U.S. student Kara Francis told me that while she did have to field some questions about then-President George W. Bush, she never felt looked down on for being American.\n\"No, to the contrary, every time I tell a Syrian that I'm American, they just get really happy and excited,\" she said back then. \"And you know, they tell me that they don't like Bush, and I tell them that I don't either.\"\nIn November, I spent a week in Damascus and found things are different now. The foreign students are gone. Nearly six years of conflict have killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians and displaced millions more. The Obama administration has repeatedly called for President Bashar Assad to step down, and anti-American feelings are abundant.\nThat's in large part, Syrians say, because of the brutal devastation wrought by a war that neither Western powers, regional actors, Russia nor the U.N. seem willing or able to stop. Those hard feelings are reinforced daily by the preferred news outlets here  state-run television and RT, the Russian broadcaster that serves up a steady diet of negative stories about the U.S.\nDamascus still has places like Caf Rawda, a popular downtown hangout for intellectuals, artists and academics. It's known as a place to find unusually candid opinions  philosophical, political or otherwise  in a city where dissent can be uncovered and punished by the authorities with shocking speed.\nThose conversations are probably still taking place, but on this visit, I didn't get to hear them. Once the management learned of my presence, I was asked to leave  not for being a reporter, but for being an American reporter.\nAt another, smaller caf a few blocks away, I met Mohammad, who greeted me with the warmth and politeness I remember from eight years ago. He agreed to answer my questions if I didn't reveal his family name or where he works. In this tightly controlled state, even explaining what's wrong with American foreign policy requires permission.\nHe said anti-American feelings are stronger now, but it's not just the USA.\n\"Actually, we don't just hate America, it's all the Western powers, everyone standing back and watching Syria get consumed by war or adding to the killing for their own reasons,\" he said. \"We have no good feeling towards the American government, of course, after many years of bad policies. We watched Iraq crumble and never imagined it could happen here.\"\nEvery country has at least one national myth: America was the melting pot where immigrants came to build a new life. Many Syrians still like to think of their country as the moderate, pan-Arab peacemaker that strove to hold a fractious region together. Now people wonder if Syria can hold itself together.\nMohammad said the Syrians who are dying in their homes and in the ocean fleeing to Europe know what it would take to silence the guns  but it's out of their hands.\n\"To stop this war, everyone knows we need an agreement between Russia and America,\" he said  adding, perhaps a bit hopefully, \"If they agree, it will stop immediately.\"\nI got in touch with Mohammad again after Donald Trump's election as U.S. president to see what he thought.\nHe said the Syrian government will probably be happy with the election results, given Trump's oft-stated wish to get along with Russia. But he's not convinced it will bring peace. What if Trump and Putin agree, in Mohammad's words, to \"keep the Syrian fire pit burning?\"\nHe says a friend of his, a visual artist, is planning a new series of works. It will explore the theme of \"insanity taking over the world.\"",

        "content": "U.N. investigators established that sarin gas was used in parts of the rebel-held Ghouta suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus in 2013. The United States accused Syria's government of conducting the attack, which it estimated killed around 1,400 people, but Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels.\nMaking the film was an emotional but necessary experience for Husari and his performers, who were witnesses to and victims of the attack, and not trained actors.\n\"The most difficult thing was the casting and auditions,\" said Husari, who took about two months to write, produce and direct the 15-minute film and is currently editing it.\n\"A 70-year-old man said to me: I want to be part of this movie because I lost 13 of my family ... I want the world to know what we've been through. And all I wanted from him is just to be a dead body,\" he said.\n\"I was amazed with how much those people were able to express their tragedy and to cooperate with me on this movie.\"\nSyria's civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced 11 million -- about half of Syria's pre-conflict population. It has caused a refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe and drawn in regional and global powers.\nMohamed Demashki, a business student and professional bodybuilder before the war who plays the main character, said he took part in the film because of its message.\n\"It tries to convey to the world that the people who live here are not just fighters, they are not terrorists. They are people with a life. The war conditions them to become fighters,\" he said.\nWhen the sarin attack happened, Husari took his camera to the makeshift hospitals that sprang up to cope with thousands of victims and sent the footage to international media.\n\"I wasn't filming because I am a cameraman, I was filming because this is the only thing I could do for the victims,\" he said.\n\"During it, you can't feel anything, you just feel shock ... After, when you just think about what you have witnessed, you rethink how big and real and really tragic this was. It is not easy for me to watch my footage.\"\nU.S. President Barack Obama had said use of chemical weapons would be a red line, but after the 2013 attack, it became clear Washington would not back up his words with military action.\nWhile Syria destroyed its declared stockpile of chemical weapons under international supervision, warring parties continue to accuse each other of attacks involving mustard gas, chlorine and other chemicals.\nHusari, who studied film at the Brighton Film School in Britain, now makes a living covering the Syrian conflict for international news organizations, but still hopes to make filmmaking his career.\nSpeaking to Reuters by phone over a background wail of air raid sirens and the roar of warplanes, Husari said that living the daily reality of war will equip him to tell the story of the conflict when the war ends and films can start to be made.\n\"Let's just think about how I reacted to those war jets in the sky. It has become something very normal to me, and this is something it is really hard to understand from the outside,\" he said.\nHe has acquired the tools to direct actors to accurately respond to events in a conflict setting, he said.\n\"I feel I have a responsibility in the future to tell this story, these stories, through cinema and drama. That's usually what happens after every war,\" he said.\nWith parts of Damascus's Ghouta under opposition control from the beginning of the conflict, a number of areas have come under siege by Syrian government and allied forces.",

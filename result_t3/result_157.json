        "content": "Venezuelas government-controlled National Electoral Council said that President Nicols Maduro won reelection July 28, but the U.S. government and other world leaders are calling for more transparency and have said evidence shows Maduro lost.\nThe National Electoral Council has not released vote counts by precincts, as Venezuelan law requires. Maduros main challenger, Edmundo Gonzlez Urrutia, has also declared victory. Gonzlez Urrutias party says it has at least 80% of the vote tallies, known as \"actas,\" and that they show he won at least 67% of the vote.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Aug. 1 that the vote processing and results announcement by the National Electoral Council \"were deeply flawed, yielding an announced outcome that does not represent the will of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\"In the days since the election, we have consulted widely with partners and allies around the world, and while countries have taken different approaches in responding, none have concluded that Nicols Maduro received the most votes this election,\" Blinken said. \"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonzlez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuelas July 28 presidential election.\"\nFlorida's Republican U.S. senators blamed President Joe Bidens administration for Maduro claiming victory. Florida has the biggest Venezuelan population in the U.S.\n\"Maduro has stolen another election from the Venezuelan people & the Biden-Harris admin helped him do it by fueling his power with sanctions relief & appeasement,\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said July 29 in an X post.\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also posted July 29 on X: \"Biden & Harris broadly eased Trump sanctions on Maduro regime as part of a deal for elections in #Venezuela,\" adding that the election \"was a complete fraud.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump said July 31 on Truth Social that \"Kamala Harris should never have taken the Trump Oil Sanctions off Maduro.\" Trump also said that the promise of free and fair elections was \"fake\" and that Venezuelans' \"blood\" was on Harris and Bidens hands.\nThe Biden administration eased sanctions on Venezuela after the Venezuelan government agreed with opposition leaders to hold elections this year. But Latin America experts we spoke to said its simplistic and inaccurate to imply that the sanctions lifting helped Maduro stay in power.\n\"An easy explanation saying, Well, if we had only kept sanctions, none of this would have happened, that's just simply not true,\" said Eduardo Gamarra, a Florida International University political science professor.\nGamarra said statements such as these ignore a broader, more complicated context. For example, Maduro remained in power despite tougher sanctions under Trump.\nElectoral officials tally votes July 28, 2024 after polls closed for presidential elections in Caracas, Venezuela. (AP)\nBiden eased some sanctions after it Venezuela agreed to hold elections\nIn October 2023, Maduros government and the main opposition alliance signed the Barbados Agreement, committing to hold open and fair elections in 2024 with independent international observers. The U.S., in exchange, relieved some Trump-era sanctions for oil and gas companies, warning that the sanctions would return if Maduro did not uphold the agreement.\nAt the time, the Biden administration was under domestic pressure to increase oil production. In 2023, U.S. oil reserves were at their lowest level since 1983, federal energy data shows. Oil companies in the U.S., such as Chevron, that the sanctions affected, also pressured Biden to lift them, Gamarra said. With the lifting of sanctions, U.S. companies could pump oil from Venezuela again.\nIn April, the U.S. reimposed some sanctions on Venezuela after it said the government fell short of fulfilling some of the commitments it agreed to in the Barbados Agreement. For example, Maria Corina Machado, the opposition leader, and an alternative opposition candidate, were banned from running for president.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro holds a small copy of the constitution July 31, 2024, as he gives a news conference at Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela. (AP)\nMaduros government says he won reelection. Did lifting sanctions affect the outcome?\nDespite the disputed election results, Latin America experts partly credited the Biden administrations sanction policy for Venezuela holding an election with an opposition candidate.\nGamarra presented two possible scenarios that could have unfolded without the Barbados Agreement and the U.S. negotiations: Maduros government wouldnt have held elections, or would have held elections without a genuine competitor.\n\"Without external incentives the Maduro government might not have allowed Gonzlez to run at all,\" said Rebecca Hanson, an assistant professor at the University of Floridas Center for Latin American Studies.\nHanson and other Latin America experts also noted that a usually fragmented opposition coalesced during these elections. Without this, \"it would be much more difficult to know if election results had been manipulated,\" Hanson said.\nThe Barbados Agreement also \"committed the (Venezuelan) government to enter a terrain where they were forced to reveal how uncompetitive they were,\" said Javier Corrales, a political science professor at Amherst College.\nThe Biden administration provided the \"best option\" Venezuelas opposition has had in 25 years to oust Maduro from political power in a \"democratic way,\" Gamarra said.\nAlejandro Velasco, a New York University Latin American history associate professor, said, \"What has been happening over the last year is that the government has seen an opposition which has surprised it by being very united, very cohesive, many of the things that the opposition has not been able to achieve in the last 10 years.\"\nVenezuelas opposition has had a history of boycotting elections and having internal fragmentation.\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado and opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzlez Urrutia hold up vote tally sheets, July 30, 2024, during a protest against the official presidential election results in Caracas, Venezuela. (AP)\nThe U.S. has imposed sanctions on Venezuela for decades, Maduro remains in office\nThe U.S. has had fraught diplomatic relations with Venezuela for decades and started imposing sanctions in 2006, according to the Congressional Research Service. Trump increased and expanded the sanctions, targeting not just specific people, but also industries, University of Illinois political science professor Damarys Canache wrote in January.\nOver the past decade, Venezuelans have faced hyperinflation; food and medicine shortages; and human rights abuses. As a result, since 2014 nearly 8 million people have fled the country, according to the United Nations.\nUnder Trumps sanctions, Maduro had no incentive to conduct free and fair elections, Velasco said.\nExperts said its common for countries to negotiate or pressure other countries via sanctions. The U.S. has done it, with different levels of success with Cuba, Iraq, Nicaragua and the Balkans.\nPolice hurdle a gas canister at protesters demonstrating against the official election results declaring President Nicolas Maduro's reelection, the day after the vote in Caracas Venezuela, July 29, 2024.

        "content": "Venezuela's President Nicols Maduro has won re-election to another six-year term, in a vote marred by an opposition boycott and claims of vote-rigging.\nAmid food shortages stemming from a severe economic crisis turnout was low.\nThe National Electoral Council (CNE) put it at just 46% but the opposition alleges it was even lower.\nThe main opposition candidate, Henri Falcn, rejected the result soon after the polls closed and called for new elections.\n\"We do not recognise this electoral process as valid... we have to have new elections in Venezuela,\" he said.\nWhat's the result?\nWith more than 90% of the votes counted, Mr Maduro had 67.7% - 5.8 million votes - CNE chief Tibisay Lucena announced. Mr Falcn had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said.\nWhy is there a row about the turnout?\nWith Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote.\nThe CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots.\nThe opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed.\nCan the CNE figures be trusted?\nUnder the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections.\nIt is made up of five members. The opposition alleges that four of the five are government stooges and therefore does not trust the body to be independent.\nLuis Emilio Rondn, the one CNE member which has been critical of the government, said he did not recognise the results because \"Venezuelans' freedom to vote\" had not been respected.\nWhat was President Maduro's reaction?\nMr Maduro and his supporters were jubilant. The 55 year old told cheering crowds outside the presidential palace in Caracas that \"the revolution is here to stay!\".\nHis supporters chanted \"let's go, Nico!\" as fireworks went off and confetti was fired in the air.\nHe also mocked his main rival, Mr Falcn, saying he had been left \"groggy\" by the knockout victory Mr Maduro had achieved.\nAnd while on the one hand he called for dialogue with the opposition, he also told supporters that \"the opposition must leave us alone to govern\".\nPrevious attempts at dialogue between the opposition and the government have failed.\nWhy is the opposition crying foul?\nThe main opposition coalition had warned that the election would not be free and fair.\nIt said the poll had been brought forward from December 2018 to take advantage of disarray within opposition ranks and that some of the most promising candidates had been banned from standing or jailed, while many others had fled the country.\nThat is why it called for a boycott. Mr Falcn however broke ranks, arguing Venezuelans should be given a chance to vote Mr Maduro out of office.\nBut following the vote, he too alleged it had been rigged in Mr Maduro's favour, by abuse of the scanning of state-issued benefits cards used for accessing food. He has called for a rerun.\nHow did people react in Venezuela?\nBy Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, Caracas\nSuch was the expectation that Nicols Maduro would win that his rivals admitted defeat, denouncing the result before it had even been announced. There was never going to be any result other than a Maduro victory - and Venezuelans knew that.\nIt feels like most people here are no longer outraged. Disappointed, maybe, but it's par for the course in a country where political freedom feels increasingly limited.\nMr Maduro has promised change in Venezuela - why he needed a second mandate to do that is anyone's guess. He's already been in the job five years. Added to that, change for the better under Mr Maduro is unlikely. With international pressure likely to build after these results, and with a crumbling economy, his job is harder than ever - as are the lives of Venezuelans.\nWhat has the international reaction been?\nAs polling started, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the election as a \"sham\" on Twitter.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose accept and continue.\nThe US mission to the United Nations called the process an \"insult to democracy\" and Chile and Panama said that they would not recognise the result.\nEl Salvador and Cuba, on the other hand, congratulated President Maduro on his election win.\nWhat next?\nAll eyes are now on the US to see whether it will impose sanctions on Venezuela's all-important oil sector, as it has threatened to do.\nThe European Union and Latin American countries had also warned ahead of the vote that they would take measures against the government if it went ahead with the election.",

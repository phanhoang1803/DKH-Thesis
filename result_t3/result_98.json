    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 4,
      "explanation": "The scenario described in the caption is plausible.  Protests targeting the fossil fuel industry and central banks are common, and using a fire extinguisher on a small, symbolic fire (a paper globe) is a believable action within such a protest.  The location (ECB headquarters in Frankfurt) is also realistic for such a demonstration. There's nothing inherently implausible about the description. However, without specific verification of the event, the confidence level is not absolute.",
      "supporting_points": "• Climate activism and protests against fossil fuels are widespread.\n• Symbolic actions and prop use are common in demonstrations.\n• The European Central Bank is a frequent target for protests related to economic and environmental policies.\n• Fire extinguishers are readily available and could be used (though perhaps inappropriately) to extinguish a small fire.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The image strongly supports the caption's description of a person using a fire extinguisher on a burning globe during a demonstration.  The internal and external checks both find the caption plausible. However, the external check is knowledge-based, relying on the common occurrence of such protests and the plausibility of the actions described.  Lack of direct evidence from a reputable news source limits the confidence score. The location details (Frankfurt, Germany) are consistent with the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Image and caption align well. Internal and external checks support the caption's plausibility, but the lack of direct evidence lowers the confidence score."

That meme claimed BLM had raised \"over a billion dollars\" but had not used that money to provide necessities such as food, housing, or schooling; instead, they had expended it on buying \"huge charter busses to transport members to riots\":\nAs for the first part of the meme, BLM is a \"decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people\"; it isn't a centrally organized group that was founded for the purpose of feeding the hungry, providing housing, or funding schooling, nor does it raise money on that basis.\nMoreover, the photograph accompanying this meme does not show any buses purchased by BLM \"to transport members to riots,\" or for any other purpose. The vehicles pictured here belong to the Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, who wrapped their buses with the Black Lives Matter name as a show of support for the movement, as documented on the Raptors' Twitter account:",

      "explanation": "The news caption is inaccurate. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, debunks the claim.  The image in question shows buses belonging to the Toronto Raptors, not buses purchased by Black Lives Matter. The Raptors used their buses to show support for the BLM movement by wrapping them with the BLM logo. The caption misrepresents the purpose and ownership of the buses, suggesting they were purchased by BLM to transport members to riots. This is false.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes article directly refutes the claim.  It states that the photo shows buses belonging to the Toronto Raptors, which had BLM branding as a show of support.

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the presence of entities related to Black Lives Matter and buses in the image and caption.  It correctly identifies these entities but doesn't assess the accuracy of the caption's claim regarding the buses' ownership and purpose. The external check, using a reputable source (Snopes), definitively refutes the caption's claim. Snopes provides evidence that the buses belong to the Toronto Raptors and were used to show support for BLM, not purchased by BLM to transport members to riots. This discrepancy between the caption and the confirmed facts makes the caption out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from the external source directly contradicting the caption's claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially supports the caption by identifying relevant entities. However, external evidence from Snopes strongly refutes the caption's claim, revealing a misrepresentation of the buses' ownership and purpose.  The caption is definitively out of context."

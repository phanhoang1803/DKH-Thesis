The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks the claim that Disney announced a remake of 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' with Kate Winslet.  The source identifies the announcement as a hoax originating from a fan-made movie poster that circulated on social media.  Therefore, the caption's central assertion is false.",

However, external verification from Snopes.com confirms that this poster is fan-made and that Disney has not announced a remake of the film with Kate Winslet. The news caption is therefore factually incorrect and out of context.",

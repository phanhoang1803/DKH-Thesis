On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

The image is of a Brazilian girl with a medical condition, not a pregnant child. The caption uses the image to promote an Islamophobic agenda by falsely connecting a Muslim man to the child's condition. The Snopes article provides detailed information about the original image and its misuse, including the child's identity and medical history, as well as the original source of the image.",

The original news caption falsely claims the girl is 9 years old and pregnant by a Muslim man.  Internal validation finds no connection between the provided entities and the false caption. External validation, specifically a Snopes fact-check, definitively proves the caption is false and misleading.  Snopes reveals the image depicts a Brazilian girl with a liver and spleen condition, refuting the pregnancy claim and exposing the Islamophobic misuse of the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly indicate that the caption is completely false and out of context. The image shows a child with a medical condition, not a pregnant child, and the caption's association with a Muslim man is entirely fabricated."

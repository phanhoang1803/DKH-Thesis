Instead most were walking with a purpose, perhaps to go to work or to pick up lunch.\nThe bigger shops had several people inside but if you looked through the windows of the more specialists shops, the sales assistants were standing alone, with no-one to serve.\nPeople eating in a sit-down restaurant were pretty much eating alone, however places where food could be taken away had a steady trade.\nThere were still a few tourists, strolling down either looking for their hotel or pointing out the sights, but how long they will stay here remains to be seen.\nLondon is not on lockdown - but people are definitely attempting to keep a social distance.\nAll pictures subject to copyright",

      "explanation": "The BBC news report describes streets around popular landmarks in London as quieter than normal on the day in question, but not deserted.  While Leicester Square's specific condition isn't detailed, the overall description of London's streets as less busy, not deserted, suggests the caption is inaccurate.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: BBC News report states that streets around London landmarks were quieter than normal, but it does not state that Leicester Square was deserted.  The report mentions Oxford Street being far from busy but not empty, indicating that a degree of activity was present.  The report gives examples such as some people shopping and eating in restaurants and some tourists present.",

    "explanation": "The image shows Leicester Square with some people present, but far fewer than would be expected normally.  The internal check correctly identifies Leicester Square. However, the external evidence from a BBC News report indicates that while London streets were quieter than usual on March 17th,  they weren't completely deserted.  The BBC report specifically notes some activity on Oxford Street, implying that complete desertion was not the norm in central London that day.  Therefore, while the image displays a less crowded square than usual, describing it as \"deserted\" is inaccurate according to the corroborating evidence. The visual evidence, while showing fewer people, does not support \"deserted\" which suggests a complete lack of people.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the caption's identification of Leicester Square. However, external validation from a BBC News report contradicts the caption's claim that the square was deserted, indicating it was quieter but not entirely empty. This discrepancy, supported by visual observation of the image, leads to an overall conclusion that the caption is out of context."

        "content": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP)  A beloved giraffe at a zoo in South Dakota has died.\nOn Thursday, the Great Plains Zoo and Butterfly House & Aquarium in Sioux Falls announced the death of Chioke, an 18-year-old reticulated giraffe. He died March 28.\nFollowing a severe fracture in his front left foot, Animal Care and Veterinary leaders made the difficult, but responsible, decision to humanely euthanize him, the zoo said in a news release.\nChioke, born in Busch Gardens in Tampa, Florida, came to the zoo in 2007. He grew to nearly 15 feet tall and sired three offspring, who went on to other zoos. The Great Plains Zoo remembered him for his playfulness.\nHe had recurring hoof and foot issues in his later years, including two fractures to the tip of his toe bone and resulting arthritis, the zoo said. He suffered a more serious fracture in March.\nThe zoo consulted nationwide for a treatment plan and used several methods, including drugs, rest and laser therapy, but ultimately decided to euthanize Chioke due to quality-of-life concerns after his team had ruled out immobilizing him for surgery or an orthopedic device, and X-rays showed the fracture had worsened.\nZoo staff visited the giraffe to say goodbye, feeding him apple biscuits, a favorite of his.\nWe remember Chioke as a gentle, curious, mischievous giraffe who was always up for feedings and interacting with his keepers and guests, the zoo said. Chioke means gift from God, and he certainly was.",

        "content": "SCOTT SIMON, HOST:\nAs humans age, our medical needs change. That's true for animals. Zoos are increasingly concerned with the needs of their older residents. Some are getting creative about how they care for these elderly animals. WYPR's Scott Maucione reports from the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore.\nSCOTT MAUCIONE, BYLINE: Like many in their older years, Joice is dealing with hip arthritis.\nMELISSA SOMOGYI: She is on a joint supplement, and she also gets ibuprofen as needed if she is feeling a bit sore.\nMAUCIONE: That's Melissa Somogyi. She's a zookeeper, and Joice is a chimpanzee. At 51 years old, Joice is well past the average lifespan for her species. They usually live to be about 40. Today, she's blowing raspberries at her zookeepers.\n(SOUNDBITE OF CHIMPANZEE BLOWING RASPBERRIES)\nMAUCIONE: The arthritis has limited her range of motion and caused some walking issues.\nSOMOGYI: One of the coolest things that we do with her is a kind of like a physical therapy.\nMAUCIONE: Unlike human patients, chimps have one of the strongest bites in nature at 1,300 pounds per square inch. The physical therapy can be a little tricky. The zookeepers always keep a barrier between them and the chimps. They fashioned special PVC pipes to stick through the bars.\nSOMOGYI: So we will do a training session with her every day, and we will move her feet around in different positions and locations and really just stretch out those legs and hips. And that seems to help her quite a bit.\nMAUCIONE: Joice lays on her back - think happy baby pose - and rests her feet on the pipes. Zoos are trying to think critically about their aging animals as new science comes out on how to care for them. Brian Aucone is a senior vice president for life sciences at the Denver Zoo.\nBRIAN AUCONE: So as an animal is getting to old age, what does that mean? What are the things that we need to do differently?\nMAUCIONE: Animals in captivity often live longer. They don't have to worry about getting eaten by predators. And unlike their peers in the wild, they also have access to preventative care.\nAUCONE: Whether that's from an animal health standpoint with our vet team, whether from a care standpoint, you know, nutrition.\nMAUCIONE: Back at the Maryland Zoo, keepers are opening large gates, and two giraffes scamper out for the day. Caesar's a 16-year-old reticulated giraffe. He's 18 feet tall and 2,400 pounds. His enormous size makes him prone to joint and hoof issues, especially now that he's hitting the upper end of his species' average lifespan. Dr. Ellen Bronson's the director of animal health at the Maryland Zoo.\nELLEN BRONSON: Caesar is very gregarious. He's very involved in his own care.\nMAUCIONE: As zoos learn more about animals, they try to keep consent in mind. They teach animals to come to the gates to receive care. If the animals decline some treatment and it's not critical, zookeepers respect their decision.\nBRONSON: He participates voluntarily in his medication administration, which is currently being done intramuscularly with syringes.\nMAUCIONE: Zookeepers spend a lot of time here, sometimes more than with their human families at home. They're also aware that these are wild animals and are careful not to treat them like pets. Still, they have strong attachments.\nBRONSON: We watch them grow up under our care. We watch them, you know, have their first tumbles. We take care of them as they become parents themselves and then as they age. And we're also with them at the very end.\nMAUCIONE: That's Dr. Ellen Bronson again.\nBRONSON: We are able to euthanize animals at the end when we think that their quality of life is no longer acceptable.\nMAUCIONE: When that happens, being able to end their suffering in their final days, she says, is a true gift.\nFor NPR News, I'm Scott Maucione in Baltimore.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright  2023 NPR.

      "explanation": "The caption \"A giraffe at Denver Zoo\" is too vague to be definitively confirmed or denied based on the provided evidence.  While Source 2 mentions the Denver Zoo and its senior vice president for life sciences discussing geriatric animal care, it doesn't specifically state that a giraffe is present at the zoo at that time. Source 1 discusses a giraffe's death at a different zoo entirely. Therefore, the caption lacks sufficient supporting evidence. The absence of contradictory evidence does not constitute confirmation.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The image shows a giraffe at what seems to be a zoo. However, the external validation reveals that the caption is too vague. Although one source mentions Denver Zoo, it doesn't confirm the presence of a giraffe. Another source discusses a giraffe's death at a different zoo. Thus, while the image aligns with the caption's general theme, the lack of conclusive supporting evidence, combined with the potential ambiguity, results in a low confidence score and an 'out of context' determination.",
    "validation_summary": "The image shows a giraffe in a zoo-like setting, aligning with the caption. However, external validation reveals insufficient evidence to confirm the location is Denver Zoo, despite mentioning the zoo in a different context. Hence, a low confidence score and OOC status are assigned."

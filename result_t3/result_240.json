They fled political persecution and compulsory military service, long before the current conflict.\nEthiopia's government said on Friday it was returning a large number of \"misinformed\" Eritrean refugees to Tigray after they had fled to the capital Addis Ababa - a moved which has alarmed the UN.\nWhat is the conflict about?\nThe conflict started on 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects the situation in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Both sources confirm the fighting between Ethiopian government forces and the TPLF, resulting in a large number of deaths and displacement.  Source 2 explicitly mentions that \"Hundreds, even thousands, of people are thought to have been killed in the conflict, while about 50,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan.\" This directly supports the caption's claim of hundreds killed and approximately 50,000 fleeing to Sudan. While the exact numbers remain uncertain due to communication blackouts, the overall picture presented in the caption aligns with the evidence. The BBC as a source is generally considered reliable for news reporting. However, a limitation is that the information is based on reports from different agencies and limited access, hence the uncertainty around the exact number of deaths and refugees.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a woman holding a young child, which aligns with the caption's description of refugees fleeing the Tigray conflict. The internal check confirms the correct identification of Tigray and Ethiopia as locations within the context. The external check validates the caption's claim of refugees fleeing to Sudan due to the conflict, supporting the overall narrative. While the image itself doesn't directly show the location being Sudan, the context provided by the news caption and external evidence strongly suggests this scenario. The image therefore serves as supporting visual evidence for the news caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the news caption. The image is consistent with the description of refugees from the Tigray region, and external sources verify the conflict and displacement of people to Sudan."

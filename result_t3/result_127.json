        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is inaccurate. Snopes.com debunks the claim that the Kenyan government used members of the Maasai tribe to enforce quarantine orders by whipping people.  The video circulating online is from a Kenyan comedian and intended as entertainment. While the Kenyan government did use violent tactics to enforce curfews, as reported by the Washington Post, this did not involve the Maasai tribe in the manner described in the caption. Therefore, the caption misrepresents the situation by conflating a comedic video with actual government actions and falsely associating the Maasai tribe with this enforcement.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes.com article states that the video is miscaptioned and from a Kenyan comedian; it does not depict the Kenyan government employing the Maasai tribe to whip people. Source 1: The Washington Post reported on violent tactics used by Kenyan security forces to enforce curfews, but not those involving the Maasai tribe as depicted in the video.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a man in Maasai clothing, but there is no evidence of whipping or violence.  Internal validation correctly identifies the Kenyan context. However, external validation from Snopes decisively refutes the caption's claim. Snopes confirms the video is from a Kenyan comedian, not official government action, and that the claim of Maasai tribe members whipping people to enforce quarantine is false.  The Washington Post's report on violent government enforcement methods supports the inaccuracy of the caption's specific claim regarding the Maasai tribe.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption's context, but strong external evidence from Snopes and the Washington Post completely refutes the core claim, showing the caption is out of context."

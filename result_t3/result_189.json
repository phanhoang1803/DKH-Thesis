        "content": "Claim:\nA video captures a cat with an extremely deep meow.\nIn May 2017, a 2015 video featuring a cat with an unusually deep voice inexplicably went viral, and was duly picked up by various tabloids:\nDont let this cats small stature fool you  he has a bass voice that would put Barry White to shame.\nIn a video filmed by the kittys owner, hes just chilling on the kitchen counter. Unsurprisingly, his ridiculously low voice has gone viral, with a lot of people wondering how its physically possible for such a tiny cat to produce such a noise.\nThere are several reasons to be skeptical about this footage. The video was originally posted to YouTube by \"Cash CatFlava\" in December 2015, bearing the description \"So this is Jack and he has some sort of type of laryngeal paralysis? At least thats what the vet told me.\"\nSome cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: \"While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat's meow, I've yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat's meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn't change over time!\"\nAccording to the American College of Veterinarian Surgeons, a cat with laryngeal paralysis may display harsh panting or a coarse (not deeper) voice:\nIn dogs and cats with laryngeal paralysis, the muscles that normally pull the airway open do not function properly. When an affected pet breathes in, the walls of the airway do not pull openrather, they are sucked into the opening, or in severe cases sucked shut. Early in the condition, this creates increased noise when they breathe; later, it can completely obstruct their airway, and they can suffocate. The early signs of laryngeal paralysis can be quite subtle.\nYou may notice:\nharshness in their panting\nincreased panting or panting when cool and calm\na hoarse or raspy-sounding bark\nA video of a cat suffering from laryngeal paralysis shows that their meows are not comically deep, but squeaky (and arguably a little sad):\nOur attempts to find similar videos of cats with unusually deep voices were unsuccessful. In fact, the only similar video we could uncover was uploaded by the same YouTube account, Cash Cat Flava, in October 2013:\nSetting aside for the moment what a coincidence it would be that the same person has come across two cats with laryngeal paralysis who sound identical, this video actually gives itself away as a fakery in the first few seconds. Before the cat exits the house, you can hear audio of its actual regular-pitched meow.",

    ],
    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The news caption is largely inaccurate. While the source mentions the caption verbatim, it also thoroughly debunks the claim.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, investigates the viral video and concludes it's likely overdubbed, with the cat's meow not naturally having such a deep bass voice. The source provides evidence suggesting the deep voice was added artificially and that a naturally deep meow is not a known symptom of laryngeal paralysis, a condition initially suggested as an explanation. Therefore, the caption's assertion of a naturally deep bass voice is unsupported and likely false.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that a video of a cat with an extremely deep meow appears to be overdubbed.  The source cites a veterinarian's opinion that such a deep, human-like meow is not typical for cats and that laryngeal paralysis, initially suggested as a possible cause, doesn't manifest in that way. The source also points out a previous video from the same YouTube channel showing the cat's normal meow, undermining the claim of a naturally deep voice.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check is inconclusive due to the lack of entities. However, the external check from Snopes strongly suggests the caption is false.  Snopes provides evidence that the video's deep meow is likely an overdub, not a natural characteristic of the cat. The claim that the cat has a naturally deep bass voice is therefore unsupported and likely fabricated. The image itself shows a small cat, which might make the claim seem plausible at first glance, but the external evidence definitively refutes the caption's central claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check inconclusive; external evidence (Snopes) strongly contradicts the caption, indicating the caption is out of context."

      "explanation": "There are no entities provided to compare against the caption.  Therefore, a judgment cannot be made on their usage, accuracy, or contextual correctness.  The caption is internally consistent, but without entities, there's nothing to evaluate in this regard.",

      "confidence_score": 3,
      "explanation": "While geese are known for protective behavior towards their own young, extending such behavior to an unrelated, abandoned puppy is unusual but not entirely impossible.  The plausibility hinges on the goose's individual temperament and prior experiences. There's no inherent biological incompatibility, but such cross-species nurturing is outside the norm. The caption's emotional tone is somewhat typical of social media posts and may not reflect strictly objective reporting, reducing confidence.",
      "supporting_points": "Geese are protective birds. Cross-species nurturing is rare but not unheard of. The caption's phrasing is emotionally charged, common in social media but less so in traditional news.",
      "verdict": true

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The image shows a goose with its wings spread over a small dog.  The visual evidence strongly supports the caption's core claim of the goose sheltering a puppy.  The internal check doesn't provide entities to cross-reference, limiting its direct support. The external check acknowledges the unusual nature of interspecies nurturing but finds the caption's core message plausible, albeit with limitations. The emotional tone of the caption is not strictly factual, but it is typical for social media sharing. Overall, there is no major contradiction. The lower confidence score reflects the reliance on general knowledge and absence of direct evidence to confirm the specific context surrounding the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Visual evidence strongly supports the caption, while internal checks are inconclusive due to the lack of entities. The external check finds the central claim plausible but unusual, and notes the typical social media phrasing."

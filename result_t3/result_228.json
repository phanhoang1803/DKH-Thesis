While the pictures do show an engine that has been removed from an aircraft, when and where they were taken (and whether they have any connection to Air China or any other airline) is unknown. Nonetheless, they do not document a case of substandard repairs or an occurrence anything like the circumstances described in the accompanying text. The pictures included in the e-mail show engine fan blades that have suffered foreign object damage (FOD) such as encountering a bird strike or a hail storm, and the \"seatbelts\" are tie-down straps used to secure the engine to a shipping stand as it is removed from the aircraft for inspection, repair, or replacement.",

The claim has circulated with various airline attributions since at least 2001.",

Snopes.com, a reliable fact-checking website, confirms this inaccuracy, stating that the image depicts an engine removed for inspection or repair, secured with tie-down straps, not a hasty repair with seatbelts. The claim has circulated with misinformation since at least 2001.",

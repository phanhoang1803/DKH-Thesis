        "content": "Summary\nTo hear President Donald Trump tell the story of the U.S. steel industry, it went from dead or going out of business to thriving all because of the 25% tariffs on imported steel he instituted in March 2018. While the tariffs have benefited U.S. steel producers, the reality of the impact isnt that stark.\nDomestic prices went up, for instance, but are now back down below the level they were when Trump was inaugurated. Production has gone up, too, but has been higher as recently as 2014. While the industry has announced several new investments, its simply not true that a new mill hadnt been built in 30 years, as the president wrongly claimed. Steel and iron mill jobs have increased, but theyre below the pre-Great Recession level. And technology has been a major factor affecting the long-term jobs decline.\nBelow, well look at several claims Trump has made about the steel industry in recent months and how they measure up to the facts.\nIn late March 2018, Trump instituted the 25% tariffs on imported steel, and 10% tariffs on aluminum, with temporary exemptions for some countries, using his authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. As required by the act, the Commerce Department had determined that the imports threatened national security. Two months later, he permanently exempted Argentina, Brazil and South Korea from the steel tariffs, with quotas on imports instead. Australia was also exempted, without a quota. In August 2018, Trump increased the tariff on steel from Turkey to 50%.\nThis year, in May, Trump lifted the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and lowered the tariff on Turkey back to 25%. U.S. companies also have received exclusions on certain imports.\nAnalysis\nSteel Was Dead?\nThe claim: And, by the way, steel  steel was dead. Your business was dead. Okay? I dont want to be overly crude. Your business was dead. And I put a little thing called a 25% tariff on all of the dumped steel all over the country. And now your business is thriving.  Trump, in a speech in Monaca, Pennsylvania, Aug. 13\nThe facts: The 25% tariff on most imported steel helped the U.S. steel industry: Prices went up (though theyre now a little below what they were when Trump took office); productivity has increased; imports decreased. But Trump exaggerates the before-and-after picture.\nThe industry wasnt dead before the tariffs, and there werent signs it was going out of business before his election, as he claimed on July 15. If I hadnt been elected, you would have no steel industry right now. It would be gone, he said at a Made in America event at the White House.\nIts safe to say the entire U.S. steel industry would not be gone had Trump not been elected.\nThe US industry has been vibrant, innovative and dynamic for the last 40 years, James Moss, a partner in First River Consulting, told us in an email.\nMoss, who has been a consultant to the steel industry for more than 20 years, said the U.S. has been a leader in the development, expansion and improvement of new technologies  such as the rise of the minimills, which produce steel from scrap metal using electric arc furnace, or EAF, technology. In 2002, minimills for the first time overtook the traditional blast furnace mills for steel production, according to a 2003 government report on the changing profile of the U.S. steel industry.\nMoss described the change as a classic US industrial story of creative destruction, which neither Europe nor Japan allowed to happen, in part, because of the industrial and social disruption it would have caused.\n[T]here are two industries. There is the declining blast furnace based industry and there is the thriving and growing electric arc furnace based industry, Moss said. [T]he blast furnace industry has been dying, but the EAF industry has been thriving. As a result, the [U.S.] steel industry overall was and is far from dead.\nWell look at several metrics for the industry: production, prices, imports and capacity utilization.\nProduction. Production is up since 2016, but it has been higher as recently as 2014. Figures from the U.S. Geological Survey, which gets its data from the American Iron and Steel Institute, show an increase in raw steel production from 2016 to 2018 of 10.8%. Production hit 87 million metric tons in 2018, but was 88.2 million metric tons in 2014.\nThese are improvements, but weve seen improvement of similar double-digit magnitude in the past, John Anton, director of steel analytics at IHS Markit, told us in citing monthly year-over-year production increases, from a high of 9.1% in January to a low of 3.1% in June. Weve also seen deep cuts in production in the past, he added. But production is up.\nRaw steel production in the U.S. topped 100 million metric tons in 2000, stayed in the 90-million range throughout that decade, and dropped considerably in 2009 during the Great Recession. Production rebounded the following year to 80.5 million metric tons, climbing higher in subsequent years before dropping 10.7% from 2014 to 2015 and remaining at that lower point through 2016.\nWhat happened in 2015-2016? Overproduction everywhere, Anton said, which lowered prices. By 2015, globally, not just the U.S., prices were absolutely atrocious.\nThe industry is filled with times when people get too enthusiastic, Anton said. Its the history of the industry.\nCicero Machado, principal analyst for Americas steel and iron ore at Wood Mackenzie, told us 2015-2016 was a low point for the industry. Not only in the U.S., but certainly in other regions, he said.\nDemand, he said, wasnt growing at a pace most steelmakers had expected. The Trump administration, Machado said, gave some excitement to steelmakers, with talk of tariffs (which were put into place) and investments in infrastructure (which havent materialized). That spurred production.\nMuch of what analysts told us about the industry pre- and post-tariff reflect classic supply and demand.\nTyler Kenyon, a vice president equity research analyst at the financial services firm Cowen, told us the tariffs prompted steel buyers to accumulate inventory, as the U.S. does rely on steel imports to meet demand. Buyers were basically fearful of their ability to procure the material they needed, Kenyon said. What we saw was a massive inventory accumulation in excess of what underlying demand would suggest is appropriate.\nWe asked Moss why  if the industry is as vibrant as he said  crude steel production has declined in recent decades. He gave three reasons, which he summed up as part macro-economic, part technical and part wrong metric for measuring vitality.\nSteel is a mature industry in a developed economy. We use less and less of it for every dollar of GDP. As much as our infrastructure needs renovating, were mostly built out. So were not a very steel intensive economy compared to say China, he said. Second, everything got lighter. Steel got lighter (thinner gauges) and stronger (better grades) so you use less of it for a given application. Plastic displaced some of it, too. So you would expect there to be a decline in use as an economy matures. Third, steel processing technology got much more efficient.\nPrices. The 25% tariffs on imported steel then boosted prices in the U.S., at least for 2018, which was good news for steel companies bottom lines.\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board  no fan of the tariffs  noted in a Feb. 3 editorial all the superlatives steel company executives used on investor calls. Nucors and Steel Dynamics CEOs said 2018 was a record year for their companies, and AK Steels and U.S. Steels CEOs said it was the best in the last 10 years.\nWith the price spike, the mills were minting money, the editorial argued, to the detriment of Americas consumers and steel-reliant industries. Ford Motor Co. said its tariff costs on steel and aluminum amounted to $750 million in 2018, and Caterpillar said it would raise prices in the second half of 2018 to offset higher costs due to the tariffs.\nThe steelmakers were very happy, Machado said, but the end users, probably not so much. There are always two sides to this story.\nMachado shared yearly pricing figures from Wood Mackenzie for hot rolled coil, a benchmark of the industry. The annualized numbers show prices jumping from $687 per U.S. ton in 2017 to $918 in 2018 and back down to $682 this year. Prices hadnt reached more than $900 per U.S. ton since hitting $964 in 2008.\nProjections through 2025 from Wood Mackenzie show prices staying around $660 per U.S. ton in coming years, which is close to the average price from 2010 through 2017.\nWeekly pricing data from Argus Media in the chart below show the impact of the tariffs, as prices increased in anticipation of the tariffs and continued to rise in the months immediately after the tariffs, hitting a high of $913 per U.S. ton the week of July 9, 2018, before falling and stabilizing this summer. Argus has the hot rolled coil price at $588 per U.S. ton the week of July 30, which is lower than it was the week of Trumps inauguration.\nThe price spike in 2018 was unsustainable. U.S. steel prices went up by more than the tariff rate, said Anton, who put the increase at about 53% higher than European prices. When you go too high, he said, youre going to attract imports. Prices now in the U.S. are only about 7% higher than European prices, he said.\nAs soon as prices remain high, imports will still be something very attractive, Machado said, noting that the tariff didnt cover all countries, such as Brazil. We saw a big jump in Brazilian imports into the U.S.\nAnd then theres the issue of that accumulated inventory before the tariffs. For 2019, Machado said, Demand is weakening, supply is outpacing demand.\nKenyon said that over the last year, weve seen the supply chain attempt to work down those inventories.\nImports. Machado said the tariffs did work in terms of keeping imports low, though Wood Mackenzie expects 2019 imports to be lower than 2018, more so because U.S. prices fell. (Commerce Department figures support the expectation that imports will decline for 2019.) End users of steel, he said, arent looking for imported steel as much because domestic prices are lower. But if prices increase again, end users will find ways to import from some countries not in the 232 list.\nImport figures from the U.S. Geological Survey show imports fell by 7.5% from 2017 to 2018, but theyre up from 2016.\nOther factors influencing U.S. prices, production and imports include the easing of the tariffs, weakening global demand and the economy generally.\nIn May, the Trump administration lifted the 25% tariff on steel imported from Canada and Mexico, and U.S. manufacturers have asked for and received exclusions for certain imported products. An April Congressional Research Service report said the administration had approved 16,500 steel exclusions out of a total of nearly 70,000 requests as of March 4.\nKenyon pointed out the tariffs now only apply to 30% of imports. Census figures for July show that the tariffs would have applied to 33% of total steel products imported, by quantity, once the exempted countries are excluded. That calculation doesnt include the exclusions Commerce has approved for U.S. steel buyers.\nThe steel industry reflects broader economic factors, Blake Hurtik, editor of Argus Metal Prices, said. It follows consumption and construction activity, and global markets.\nCapacity. The boost in price due to the tariffs and subsequent boost in cash flow for U.S. companies also prompted capacity expansions. A lot of capital is being invested in the steel industry right now, Kenyon said.\nWhen Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross issued his report to the president on his investigations into imports of steel and aluminum and his recommendations for tariffs, he said an 80% capacity utilization was an important benchmark. Each of these remedies is intended to increase domestic steel production from its present 73% of capacity to approximately an 80% operating rate, the minimum rate needed for the long-term viability of the industry, the Feb. 16, 2018, press release from the Commerce Department said.\nU.S. steel mills were operating at 80.3% of their capacity in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to figures provided to us from the American Iron and Steel Institute. An AISI spokesman said capacity for the first half of 2019 was 81.2%, and the rates in August also hovered around 80%.\nAISI provided quarterly and yearly capability utilization rates dating back to 1994, which show rates well above 80% for most of that time period but not post-Great Recession.\nStock prices. Stock prices for U.S. steel companies hit peak prices when the tariffs were implemented, but theyve tumbled since. U.S. Steel stock is down 75% from late February 2018 and 66% from January 2017, when Trump took office, while Nucor stock is down 30% from January 2018 and 19% since January 2017. However, Kenyon said once Trump was elected, investors were buying steel stocks in anticipation of pro-steel policies from the administration, and measuring the fall in stocks from peak levels due to the tariffs, doesnt truly reflect whether the industry is better off or not.\nNew Steel Mills\nThe claim: [W]e didnt have a new mill built in 30 years, and now we have many of them going up.  Trump, Aug. 13\nThe facts: Trump is completely wrong about that, Moss said, echoed by other experts.\nFirst River Consulting provided us with charts that show the U.S. steel industry since 1989 has added about 40 million short tons, or U.S. tons, (as opposed to metric tons) of carbon steel capacity (excluding stainless steel).\nFlat (or sheet and plate) steel  which is used for cars and washing machines, for example  is the most in demand, and accounts for 80% of the new capacity since then, Moss said. Long steel capacity accounts for the rest.\nIn all, Moss identified for us 23 new steel mills that added 33 million tons of annual capacity since 1989. Most of the new mills opened between 1992 and 2002. But eight of them have been built since 2007, including these three large-capacity mills:\nBig River Steel announced plans for a1.6-million-ton-annual-capacity steel millin 2013, broke ground on construction in 2014, and started production in December 2016.\nThyssenKrupp USAannounced in May 2007 that it would build a steel mill in Alabama, which opened in late 2010 at a final cost of $3.6 billion. It has the annual capacity to produce 4.7 million tons of carbon steel  making it the single largest new plant that has opened since 1989, according to First River Consulting.\nIn 2007, Severstal completed construction of the newest and most advanced electric arc furnace facility in the world, as acorporate press release described it. The company doubled the size of the facility when it completed phase two of the project in 2011, increasing annual steel production capacity to 3.4 million tons.\nAlthough it is not true that the U.S. hasnt built a new mill in 30 years, the president is right that there has been a lot of investment in the steel industry recently, said Machado at Wood Mackenzie. The amount of announcements that were made last year  was substantial, he said.\nSix new steel mills with a combined annual capacity of 7.2 million tons have been announced since 2017, according to First River. The largest is a mill in Sinton, Texas, which Steel Dynamics Inc. announced in late 2018. The mill will have an annual capacity of approximately 3 million tons.\nAll of the new facilities use the electric arc furnace technology, Moss said.\nNo one will build a new blast furnace based steelmaking facility again in the US, Moss said, because they are too expensive to build and maintain, too dirty and come with a whole bunch of corollary investments that make it hard for the steel mills they support to make money.\nIn fact, U.S. Steel in early March 2018 announced it would restart a blast furnace at its Granite City, Illinois, plant that had been idle since December 2015, citing anticipated increased demand from Trumps action on tariffs. But by June, U.S. Steel said it would idle two other blast furnaces in the U.S. and one in Europe, and restart production when market conditions improve. In August, it announced it would idle another plant in Indiana this fall.\nHurtik at Argus Metal Prices said the big capacity announcements are scrap-based, not blast furnaces. Not everybody is going to be winner. Steel is not a homogeneous thing, he said.\nSteel Jobs\nThe claim: Were putting  our steel workers back to work.  Trump, at a campaign rally, Cincinnati, Ohio, Aug. 1\nThe facts: Iron and steel mill jobs have gone up by 4,500 from January 2017 to June, a 5.6% increase, according to the latest figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe level of employment in June  85,300 workers  was 16% below the 101,700 workers in May 2007, months before the Great Recession.\nWhen we contacted the Trump campaign about the presidents claims, one factor Deputy Communications Director Zach Parkinson pointed to was job growth under Trump and a 13,500 drop in those jobs during Barack Obamas presidency. That figure is correct. Iron and steel mill jobs under Obama declined during the Great Recession, rose back up by late 2011 to the level they were when he had taken office, and slowly declined again, most considerably in 2016.\nThe long-term trend for the industry has been a decline in employment, as the chart below shows, but much of that is due to changes in technology, experts told us.\nSteel and iron mills employed 187,800 people in January 1990, and its less than half that figure now. Anton at IHS Markit said thats primarily due to new technology and more efficient mills. It takes fewer people to make the same amount of steel. Imports are a problem, he said, but improved efficiency is the No. 1 reason that you dont have as many people employed.\nThe Trump campaign also pointed to news of wage increases negotiated by unions at U.S. Steel and the mining company Cleveland Cliffs in 2018 as evidence of Trumps positive impact on the industry.\nThe United Steelworkers press release on the wage hikes at U.S. Steel noted the company projected earnings of $2 billion in 2018  as weve explained, a time of high prices for domestic steel  and workers rightly wanted a share of that success, USW International President Leo W. Gerard said. But it took a unanimous union vote to strike in September to get the new wage agreement.\nSteel Dumping\nThe claim: And they still dump, but now the United States takes in billions of dollars and the dumping is much less, and the steel companies are thriving again.  Trump, Aug. 13\nThe facts: Its unclear exactly what impact the tariffs have had on dumped steel, though, as we said, imported steel overall declined from 2017 to 2018. And 2019 imports may be lower still, though Machado said thats mainly because U.S. prices fell.\nAt the White House on July 15, Trump said, We put massive tariffs on dumped steel. But the tariffs were broader than individual antidumping measures, which were already in place.\nAntidumping cases are specific to the product, country and sometimes to the company, Anton said, whereas the Section 232 tariffs were on every country, except certain exemptions. He said dumping cases are filed every year, including cases under then-President Barack Obama.\nOn March 1, 2016, Obamas Commerce Department announced a 266% duty on cold-rolled flat steel from China, as well as duties on certain steel from Brazil, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the U.K. It upped that to 522% in May 2016.\nAt the time Trumps tariffs were imposed, the U.S. had 164 antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect for steel that restricted imports of individual steel products from certain countries  including Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey, according to the Commerce Departments Jan. 11, 2018, report recommending increasing tariffs on all steel imports. That represented a 60% increase since the departments last Section 232 investigation of the steel industry in 2001, the report said.\n(As the Congressional Research Service explained in an April report, antidumping duties are imposed when the U.S. International Trade Commission determines that goods are sold at less than fair value in the U.S. market, while countervailing duties are imposed when foreign governments are subsidizing the cost of those cut-rate imports.)\nThe Commerce report said antidumping and countervailing actions can address specific instances of unfairly traded steel products, but they are not enough in this case.\n[G]iven the large number of countries from which the United States imports steel and the myriad of different products involved, it could take years to identify and investigate every instance of unfairly traded steel, or attempts to transship or evade remedial duties, the report said.\nThe U.S. doesnt get much of its imported steel from China, which was the 11th largest source of steel for the U.S. in 2018, the same spot it held in 2016. China was the seventh largest source of steel imports in 2015, but the metric tons imported dropped considerably the following year, by 63%, according to figures from the Department of Commerce. The top three sources of U.S. imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico.\nBut China is the No. 1 steel producer in the world, by a long shot.\nHurtik at Argus Metal Prices told us even if China isnt selling steel to the U.S., its selling steel somewhere. It has an impact no matter where it ends up.\nThe April CRS report said, While China is the worlds largest steel producer, accounting for roughly 45% of global capacity, relatively little Chinese steel enters the U.S. market directly, due to extensive U.S. dumping and subsidy determinations, but the large amount of Chinese production acts to depress prices globally.\nLooking Ahead\nTheres no expiration date on the 232 tariffs. The CRS report said the presidents actions can remain in place for such time, as he deems necessary to adjust the imports so they dont threaten to impair the national security, according to the statute.\nMachado told us that while demand is weakening, Wood Mackenzie expects some growth in demand over the next two years, driven by commercial construction and infrastructure. He also expects imports to increase, partly because end users will find ways to import if prices are higher in the U.S. and partly because he expects that free trade policies would be restored.\nThe overall impact on the U.S. economy, as opposed to only the steel industry, is more complicated. The CRS report said that generally economic models would show the negative effect of higher prices for those using imports is greater than the benefit of higher profits and expanded production in the import-competing industry and the additional government revenue generated by the tariff. Theres also an impact due to retaliatory tariffs, which were imposed on $23 billion of U.S. goods in 2018 by six trading partners.\nBut CRS said the direct economic impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs may be limited because such products made up only 2% of all imports in 2018.\nSources\nCongressional Research Service.

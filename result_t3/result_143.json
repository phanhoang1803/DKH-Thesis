    "explanation": "The image shows Joe Biden interacting with a crowd of people, some of whom appear to be taking photos with their phones.  Amy McGrath is not visually identifiable in this image. The internal check shows a reasonable level of accuracy in identifying named entities. However, the external check reveals that the provided evidence (a link to the New York Times' 2018 midterm election results) is insufficient to verify the claim about Biden campaigning for McGrath in October 2018.  The external source does not provide information on campaign activities. The lack of corroborating external evidence and the absence of Amy McGrath in the image lead to a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal entity recognition partially supports the caption, but the external evidence fails to verify the claim about Biden campaigning for Amy McGrath.  The image itself doesn't show McGrath."

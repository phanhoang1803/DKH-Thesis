        "date": "2022-08-22T00:00:00",
        "content": "In New York, left-leaning politicians talk about how progressive their state is. But when it comes to voting, the Empire State has been slow to adopt voter access measures that have been passed elsewhere for decades.\nIn California, voting by mail without having to come up with an excuse to do so started four decades ago. And Arizona allowed it beginning in 1991. It doesnt exist in New York.\nEarly in-person voting began in New York in 2019. Texas has had it since the late 1980s. Florida adopted it in 1998 and broadened it in 2004.\nVoting rights advocates point to recent wins they say improves access to the ballot box: the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act, a sweeping law to prevent racial discrimination, and a bill passed by the Legislature to move the voter registration deadline closer to the election.\nBut they were caught off guard in November, when New Yorkers resoundingly rejected two measures to make it easier to vote: being able to register to vote on the same day as an election and casting an absentee ballot without an excuse.\n\"Those are the biggest, most important things we can do now to expand access to eligible voters who currently are not participating in the political process,\" said Perry Grossman, a supervising attorney who works on election law cases with the New York Civil Liberties Union.\nNew Yorkers who voted in November didnt agree.\nNo-excuse absentee ballots, which can reduce long lines at in-person polling locations, are available in some form in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The proposal was rejected by 55 percent of New York voters. Same-day registration, which allows people to register to vote on the day of an election, is available in some form in 21 states and the District of Columbia. It was rejected by 56 percent of New York voters.\n\"It was a stinging defeat for those of us who have been working on these issues,\" said Sarah Goff, deputy director of Common Cause New York.\nIf lawmakers want to put the measures up for a vote again, they would have to pass them again in two consecutive legislatures.\nVoter mistrust\nThe states Republican and Conservative parties campaigned against the proposals. Gerard Kassar, chairman of the state Conservative Party, pointed to local cases of fraudulent absentee ballots as reasons for his opposition. In an ongoing, sprawling investigation in Renssalaer County, a Republican council member in Troy pleaded guilty in June to identity theft in connection with casting three fraudulent ballots, and in a case on Staten Island, a Republican candidate for city council was suspected of using forged documents, leading to an investigation by the district attorney that began last year.\nStudies of no-excuse absentee ballots and same-day registration have shown that the policies do not lead to widespread voter fraud. Claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election have also been found to be false.\nThe Conservative Party spent around $3 million on advertisements to defeat the no-excuse absentee ballot and same-day registration proposals, as well as a reapportionment proposal, which also failed, Kassar said.\nVoters mistrust in county boards of election, which are run by political appointees of the Democratic and Republican parties, helped the Conservatives campaign, he said. He cited a recount in Rep. Claudia Tenneys last election, where 55 votes were discovered long after Election Day and voter registrations that were never processed as an example of dysfunction at some boards.\nTenney represents an upstate district that touches eight counties, but big problems exist downstate, too. The New York City Board of Elections has mishandled voter rolls, absentee ballot distribution and polling place operation.\nKassar supports early voting and wants people to vote.\n\"I do want to see people come out,\" he said. \"Were trying to stop fraud.\"\nThe NYCLUs Grossman said authorities have the tools to find fraud, as they did in Troy and Staten Island.\n\"Those are two instances of millions of absentee ballots cast,\" he said.\nHe said that turnout in November was low, which didnt help, and that voting rights advocates need to make a case to counter false or exaggerated claims of widespread fraud.\n\"Theres the constant tension between people screaming fraud and how it undermines the integrity of elections if any ineligible voter casts a ballot, versus the severe undermining of the integrity of elections that occurs when lots and lots of eligible voters arent participating,\" he said.\nWhere New York ranks\nNew York has made uneven progress in improving access to more voters. The state boasts the longest Election Day polling hours in the country, from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Gov. Kathy Hochul has extended through 2022 a provision that allows absentee ballots to be used by people concerned about contracting or spreading viruses like COVID-19, in addition to the longstanding other reasons, such as being out of the county on the day of an election or being a caregiver for an ill or disabled person.\nFrom 2016 to 2020, New York has made it easier to vote, according to the Cost of Voting Index. Academic researchers looked at laws in all 50 states, at such things as whether a state has automatic voter registration, how close to Election Day people can register to vote, and whether states allow early or mail-in voting. Despite New Yorks improvement, in 2020 the state ranked below nine other states: Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Utah, Massachusetts, California, Maryland, New Jersey and Arkansas.\nHistorically, political parties dont want greater access to the ballot, said Robert M. Stein, a political science professor at Rice University. \"They only want to bring people to the polls who are certain to vote for their candidate. Many of the laws intended to increase voter access have failed to deliver more voters to the polls, of either partisan persuasion,\" Stein said.\nVoting rights advocates in New York say that progress on changing restrictive laws began in 2019, when the Democrats took control of the State Senate. With Democrats already the majority party in the State Assembly, the party gained full control of the Legislature. That year, lawmakers approved nine days of early voting before an election, as well as online voter registration, and reduced restrictions on enrolling in a party before a primary election.\nOther changes in the last few years are automatic voter registration, which registers people to vote automatically when they interact with certain state agencies, unless they opt out. The Legislature passed it but it hasnt taken effect yet. Lawmakers have also codified an executive order that restored voting rights to people released from prison.\nThe bill that allows people to register 10 days before Election Day, instead of the previous 25 days, has to be signed by Hochul to become law. This will allow people to register and cast a ballot on the first day of early voting.\n\"Theres been a lot of progress, but theres still work to do,\" said Patrick Berry, counsel in the Democracy Program of the Brennan Center for Justice, which advocates for voting rights.\nBerry and Grossman called the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act landmark legislation that makes New York a leader in fighting racial discrimination at the polls. The act is intended to restore protections provided for in the U.S. Voting Rights Act that were removed after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder in 2013.\nThe act has many parts. It makes voting materials more accessible to non-English speakers, protects against voter suppression, and puts the burden on municipalities that have historically discriminated against minority groups to ensure these voters have access to the polls. Instead of forcing voters who have been disenfranchised to file a lawsuit after the election is over, counties that have a record of discrimination must get their election plans approved in advance. Counties that would have to do this are places where there is housing segregation, or law enforcement discrimination of minority groups, or a history of voting rights or civil rights violations. They must submit their polling place setups and other voting activities to the attorney general in advance of an election, known as preclearance.\n\"New York is about to have the only functioning preclearance program in the United States,\" said Grossman, who advocated for the acts passage.\nAs for this years voting, advocates suggested that voters check to make sure they know what district theyre voting in. Redistricting for the House of Representatives, state Senate and Assembly districts have changed district lines.\nThe state has made other changes this year:\nAbsentee ballots will have prepaid return envelopes.\nVoters who request to vote by absentee are no longer allowed to vote on a machine if they want to vote in person, though they can vote in person by affidavit ballot.\nWeekend hours for early voting have been expanded and there are more early voting sites.\nAbsentee voters will have an opportunity to cure their ballot if it was mailed in time but arrived after Election Day and was not postmarked.\nRELATED: All of our fact-checks and stories about elections",

        "date": "2022-11-08T00:49:24",
        "content": "Quick Take\nMail-in ballots have become a popular way to vote in the U.S. But the unfounded claim persists that mail ballots lead to rampant fraud and, if counted after Election Day, they are suspect. By law, many states dont start counting mail ballots until after polls close, and some continue to accept them for days after Election Day if they are postmarked by that date.\nFull Story\nA claim that seems to contradict itself  that counting all ballots will result in election fraud  was widespread in 2020 and has resurfaced ahead of this years midterms.\nFormer President Donald Trump made the claim multiple times prior to the 2020 election, alleging that mail-in ballots tabulated after Election Day were suspect and that courts should stop states from counting them. We wrote about it at the time, explaining that many states accept ballots after Election Day if they are postmarked by that date and most states arent legally allowed to start counting mail-in ballots until Election Day. So its routine to get the results after Election Day.\nNevertheless, the claim has lingered among election deniers and has had a mainstream resurgence recently.\nFor example, Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson  who hosts one of the most watched cable news shows, according to Nielsen  played a clip from President Joe Bidens Nov. 2 speech on democracy and elections, in which the president noted the popularity of voting by mail.\nWe know that more and more ballots are cast in early voting or by mail in America, Biden had said. And we know that many states dont start counting those ballots until after the polls close on Nov. 8.\nThat means, in some cases, we wont know the winner of the election for a few days  until after a few days after the election, he said. It takes time to count all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly manner.\nBut Carlson, looking incredulous, framed Bidens remarks this way: Heres Joe Biden telling you that, thanks to the changes, the many changes, Democrats have made to our system of voting  all of which make voter fraud easier to commit  we may not know the results of the elections for a few days. But dont be alarmed. Everything is completely on the level. And whatever you do, do not ask questions or else youre a criminal.\nOn Twitter, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz  who had challenged Trump in 2016, but later became an ally  posted a suggestive version of the claim, inaccurately saying: Why is it only Democrat blue cities that take days to count their votes? The rest of the country manages to get it done on election night.\nAnd a popular conservative Twitter account posted a similarly suggestive version of the claim: Funny how we could easily count every vote in every state on election night until a few years ago.\nFalse claims and conspiracy theories  particularly those aimed at the integrity of U.S. elections  have been bouncing around in partisan echo chambers for at least two years. So, many of the most common claims  like this one  are now familiar enough to the target audience that those who push them dont have to be explicit; they just have to make a suggestive reference to get the point across.\nBut at least one conservative commentator on Facebook is still spelling it out. Lars Larson, whom weve written about before, wrote in a lengthy post on the topic that counting ballots and reporting the results after Election Day is how you cheat when your party is about to lose a major election.\nLike the others, Larson questioned why the vote count couldnt be completed on election night, saying, A hundred years ago, America with no special technology or computers managed to get national elections counted the same day. In fact, prior to 2020, almost all elections produced a result on election night.\nThe problem with all of these posts is that they misrepresent the process and falsely suggest that there is something untrustworthy or nefarious about tabulating mail-in ballots after Election Day.\nWhat Counts and When\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 39 states dont allow counting to start until Election Day. Of those, 16 states dont allow counting to start until the polls close.\nAnd, according to the NCSL, 19 states accept and count mailed ballots after Election Day as long as they are postmarked on or before that date.\nContrary to Cruzs claim that only Democrat blue cities take days to count their votes, states that traditionally vote Republican  such as Alaska and Mississippi  are among those that dont allow tabulation to start until polls close on Election Day. Both states also accept mailed ballots that arrive days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked on time.\nIt is true, though, that Democrats are more likely to vote by mail than Republicans, which can lead to the so-called red mirage on election night  meaning that early results based primarily on in-person voting may favor Republicans before mail-in ballots potentially favoring Democrats are counted and reported.\nRegardless of party affiliation, though, its reasonable to expect that the outcome wouldnt be available until after election night if mail-in ballot tabulation doesnt begin until then and if appropriately postmarked ballots continue to be accepted after Election Day. The winner of the presidential race in Alaska wasnt called by the Associated Press in 2020 until Nov. 11, eight days after the election.\nAnother important factor is the increasing demand for mail-in voting.\nVoters use of mail-in ballots has grown steadily since the early 1990s, according to a report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Election Data + Science Lab.\nBy 2018, which was a midterm-election year, mail-in ballots made up more than 25% of total voter turnout, according to a report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\nNot surprisingly, the demand sharply increased in the 2020 election, which was held in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic before vaccines had become available. In 2020, 43% of voters cast their ballots by mail, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commissions report on that election.\nRequests for mail-in ballots this year remain high, but not as high as 2020.\nFor example, 1.4 million voters have requested mail-in ballots for the 2022 election in Pennsylvania. That compares with 3 million who did so in 2020. (Pennsylvania is a key state that could determine control of the Senate next year. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey chose not to run for another term, leaving a close race between Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Republican.)\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer has reported that results from this years election shouldnt take as long as they did in 2020. The newspaper predicted that most votes will be reported on election night, with the vast majority being counted by midday on Wednesday.\nThat contrasts with 2020, when the results werent clear until the Saturday following Election Day.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of State, like others, had recommended changing the law to allow counties to start opening ballot envelopes to prepare them for counting before Election Day in order to cut down on the amount of time taken for tabulation.\nBut the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled Legislature couldnt agree on implementing changes.\nMail-In Voting Safeguards\nThe fact is, mail-in ballots  like other forms of voting  are largely secure, and there is scant evidence of fraud.",

        "date": "2024-11-01T13:39:06",
        "content": "What early voting can - and can't - tell us about the US election\nElection day in the US is officially on Tuesday, but millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. With early voting events around the country drawing lines, more than 62.7m voters had handed in ballots by Thursday - a landmark number.\nPartisans on both sides have been quick to cite the early voting data as evidence that their side is gaining some kind of decisive advantage. But what does it all mean? That's a hard question to answer.\nThere's one thing we can say for certain: American voting habits have changed as pandemic behavioural shifts stick around. This year's early voting totals are well shy of the 101.5m early ballots cast in 2020, when the Covid virus kept many away from crowded polling places, but its more than the total early votes cast in 2016 (47.2m) or 2012 (46.2m).\nThough each state handles early voting differently, we can also learn a little about who is participating. Some states release raw totals of votes cast through mail-in ballots, in-person voting days or both. Many share the party registration of voters and sometimes more detailed demographic information, such as gender, race and age.\nThe rest of the picture, however, is much murkier and any insight into this election season is best taken with a heavy dose of salt.\nMany of the conclusions about early voting are being drawn based on the demographic data alone. We won't find out which candidates these ballots have been cast for until election day.\nBut here's what I'm noticing, from state reports as compiled by the University of Florida Election Lab.\nFewer Republicans are waiting until election day\nRepublicans appear to be losing their wariness of early voting. In 2020, they made up 30.5% of the total early votes cast in the 20 states that track party registration, versus 44.8% for Democrats. That was due, in part, to Trumps warning that mail voting was rife with corruption.\nThe former president is singing a different tune this year, and so far Republicans are too. They represent 36.1% of early votes cast across the country, while Democrats represent 38.9% (the remaining quarter has come from voters not affiliated with any party or who have registered with a third party).\nThats important because it means a red mirage effect may be less pronounced. Republicans took an early lead four years ago in places like Pennsylvania because election-day in-person votes were counted before poll workers tallied the early ballots, which leaned in support of Democrats.\nWomen are already turning out in large numbers\nMeanwhile, Democrats this year might be encouraged by the gender gap  at least as far as early vote participation.\nIn the six states that report gender data, including the battlegrounds of Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina, women are casting 54.2% of the early ballots so far. Thats a few percentage points higher than the 2020 mark found in a post-election exit polls conducted by Edison Research.\nIf recent surveys are correct and women are now backing Democrats by a historically large margin, it could mean a boost for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\nMixed picture in key states\nDrilling down into individual states, more than 50% of eligible voters have now cast ballots in Georgia  a sign that voter enthusiasm is high. The early turnout there is slightly whiter and older than the early voting 2020 electorate. That could help Donald Trump.\nThe former president is also getting good news in Nevada, where more registered Republicans have cast ballots than registered Democrats. Thats a dramatic break from past elections, when Democrats built up a big early voting advantage, particularly in the Las Vegas metropolitan area, which helped them prevail despite a surge of rural conservatives voting on election day.\nLike most early voting data, Nevadas tabulations come with an asterisk, however. A growing number of young voters are now unaffiliated independents even though they lean left. If they end up casting ballots for Harris, it could put the state into Harriss column on election day.\nThere are similar glass half-full or half-empty examples all over the map. In Pennsylvania, for example, more registered Democrats have voted than Republicans  but they are doing so by a smaller margin than in 2020, when President Joe Biden won the state.\nAnd none of that takes into account independent voters, frustrated moderate suburban Republicans who may be voting for Harris or traditional blue-collar Democrats who are now on board with Trump.\nAnd, lest we forget, 158m Americans cast ballots for president in 2020  65.9% of the voting-eligible population. Even if we don't hit that mark this time around, there are still a lot of potential ballots waiting to be cast.\nPolitical junkies may be desperate to read the tea leaves with just a handful of days until the election, but for the moment the results are mostly just hot water.\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

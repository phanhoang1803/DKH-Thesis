The caption mentions Congress passing a law under Trump's presidency. However, the entity \"G, ##SA\" seems to be an incorrect extraction.  \"Inauguration Day\" is correctly identified as MISC, although it could be argued to be an EVENT type entity. The use of \"In, ##au, ##gu, ##ration\" as part of \"Inauguration Day\" is a bit unusual, and this aspect lowers the confidence score.  There is no explicit mention of an organization named \"GSA\" in the caption, making this entity extraction questionable. I am uncertain about the accuracy of \"G, ##SA\". ",

        "content": "Claim:\nUnder former U.S. President Donald Trump, Congress passed a law that gives outgoing presidential administrations control of American armed forces after Inauguration Day, for up to 60 days.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn early 2021, a rumor circulated online alleging that former U.S. President Donald Trump remained the leader of America's armed forces despite the fact that Joe Biden took the presidential oath of office on Jan. 20.\nSnopes became aware of the below-displayed image, which claimed Congress passed a law in 2019 (under Trump) that allows outgoing presidents to control the federal departments of defense and homeland security after the inauguration of their successors, for up to 60 days.\nIn other words, the image claimed Trump could issue orders for all branches of the country's armed forces  including the Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard  even though he was no longer commander in chief. Under terms outlined in the post, Trump would supposedly retain that executive authority until March 21.\nThe claim was an erroneous interpretation of an amendment to a longstanding law governing presidential transitions, the 1963 Presidential Transition Act.\nThat act outlines requirements for the General Services Administration (GSA), the executive branch agency that oversees the setup of White House operations between Election Day and Inauguration Day (when a new administration takes over), and has received various updates by Congress over the decades.\nThe claim, however, stemmed from an amendment (S. 394), proposed by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in February 2019.\nThat bill, which became law in March 2020, ultimately clarified the GSA's role during transitions and established new conditions for presidential candidates before Election Day  including a requirement that they enter into a formal agreement with GSA, outlining the agency's commitment to them if they win.",

        "title": "What Laws Has Trump Signed In His First 100 Days? : NPR",
        "date": "2017-04-27T06:00:00",
        "content": "Even though President Trump calls the 100-days measure \"ridiculous,\" the White House is still touting what one press release called the president's \"historic accomplishments\"  including 28 laws he has signed since taking office.\nBut when it comes to legislation, political scientists say it is better to measure significance than to simply add up the number of bills. It is better, they argue, to ask whether a law changes the status quo or introduces a new policy idea.\nBy that measure, there is not as much to show legislation-wise for Trump's first 100 days.\nOf the 28 new laws signed by Trump, two name Veterans Affairs clinics in honor of people, one adds National Vietnam War Veterans Day to the list of days people and businesses are encouraged to fly American flags, five are related to personnel matters (including the waiver allowing James Mattis to become secretary of defense), and one extends an Obama-era policy allowing veterans in some circumstances to get health care outside of the VA system.\n\"Congress passes laws all the time, naming post offices after people, doing minor things that they can get through,\" said Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary in the Obama administration and as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. Panetta doesn't see any major legislation in this administration's first 100 days.\n\"Presidents throughout history are acknowledged as a success when they get legislation passed through the Congress  major legislation that affects the lives of people. And that ultimately will be the test for this president,\" Panetta said.\nDuring the campaign, Trump signed a \"Contract With the American Voter,\" in which he promised to work with Congress to introduce 10 bills \"and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration.\"\nOf those 10, only one  the American Health Care Act  has made it into legislative form, and it has not yet gotten a vote. The Trump administration did announce broad outlines of a tax system overhaul this week, but it isn't expected to be written into legislation until later this year.\nIn a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Trump's legislative affairs director Marc Short was asked to name the new president's most significant legislative accomplishment  to name one major new law  but he took issue with the question.\n\"I would say that confirming a Supreme Court justice of the United States who will probably be there for 30 years is a big legislative achievement,\" said Short. \"I would say the regulatory impact we've had on the economy is a big legislative achievement. And we look forward in the coming days to hopefully continue to make progress on the appropriations process and on health care.\"\nWhen he talks about \"regulatory impact,\" Short is referring to the 13 laws passed under the Congressional Review Act. Before Trump, the 1996 law had been used only once before, by George W Bush. But with GOP in control of both the House and the Senate, the Trump White House had a rare chance to significantly roll back rules written by the previous administration.\nThe Congressional Review Act allows Congress to reverse rules within 60 legislative days of their submission, requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. In the current Congress, that means Democrats are not able to block the rollbacks.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan touted the 13 laws as \"measures to take excessive regulations off the book so we can grow this economy.\"\nThey included a rule meant to protect streams from pollution, which opponents argued hurt the coal industry; and a rule requiring financial advisers to put consumers' best interests ahead of their own, which critics said would hurt retirees.\nRounding out the 28 laws, three modify existing programs and two encourage agencies to try something new.\nBut in the realm of legislation, 100 days is a short period of time. Significant bills take a long time to complete, often measured in years rather than days.\nPresident George W. Bush's first tax cut and No Child Left Behind initiative didn't pass in the first 100 days. The Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank financial industry regulations didn't become law in President Barack Obama's first 100 days either, though he and Congress did pass a nearly $800 billion stimulus bill. Other than that, Obama signed several program re-authorizations, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (that had been in the works in the previous Congress) and a bill naming a post office.\nTime frame aside, Trump learned with the health care bill he hoped to pass and sign weeks ago that having the president's party control both the House and the Senate doesn't guarantee the numbers needed for priorities to breeze through.\n\"President Obama faced a lot of the same problems,\" Panetta noted.\nPanetta said Trump will be judged on whether he can put together a working coalition, which will most likely require reaching across the aisle. Thus far Trump has tried to do everything with one-party rule  not even attempting to win Democratic votes (not that they would have been forthcoming).\nIf this year ends and Trump hasn't found a way to work with Congress and pass significant legislation like the health care bill or his tax plan, he won't be judged kindly. Presidents succeed or fail based on their ability to work with Congress.\nThe 28 Bills That Trump Has Signed Into Law\nExtending Obama-Era Policy\nS. 544: \"A bill to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to modify the termination date for the Veterans Choice Program, and for other purposes.\"\nModifying Existing Programs\nH.R. 353: \"Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017\"\nS. 442: \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017\"\nH.R. 72: \"GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017\"\nRepealing Obama-Era Rules And Regulations\nH.J.Res. 67: \"Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by qualified State political subdivisions for non-governmental employees\"\nH.J.Res. 43: \"Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule submitted by Secretary of Health and Human Services relating to compliance with title X requirements by project recipients in selecting subrecipients\"\nH.J.Res. 69: \"Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule of the Department of the Interior relating to 'Non-Subsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and Closure Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska' \"\nH.J.Res. 83: \"Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to 'Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness' \"\nS.J.Res. 34: \"A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to 'Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services' \"\nH.J.Res. 42: \"Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants\"\nH.J.Res. 57: \"Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to accountability and State plans under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965\"\nH.J.Res. 58: \"Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to teacher preparation issues\"\nH.J.Res. 37: \"Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation\"\nH.J.Res. 44: \"Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of the Interior relating to Bureau of Land Management regulations that establish the procedures used to prepare, revise, or amend land use plans pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976\"\nH.J.Res. 40: \"Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007\"\nH.J.Res. 38: \"Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of the Interior known as the Stream Protection Rule\"\nH.J.Res. 41: \"Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to 'Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers' \"\nNaming Something/Siting A Memorial/Encouraging Flag Flying\nS.J.Res. 1: \"A joint resolution approving the location of a memorial to commemorate and honor the members of the Armed Forces who served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield\"\nH.R. 1362: \"To name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA Clinic\"\nH.R. 609: \"To designate the Department of Veterans Affairs health care center in Center Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, as the 'Abie Abraham VA Clinic' \"\nS. 305: \"Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act of 2017\"\nEncouraging An Agency To Try Something New\nH.R. 321: \"Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers (INSPIRE) Women Act\"\nH.R. 255: \"Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act\"\nPersonnel-Related\nS.J.Res. 30: \"A joint resolution providing for the reappointment of Steve Case as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution\"\nS.J.Res. 36: \"A joint resolution providing for the appointment of Roger W.

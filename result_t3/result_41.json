Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a pile of gold during his time in the military.\nIn June 2020, an old photograph supposedly showing U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects the content of the external evidence.  The evidence from Snopes confirms that an old photograph circulated online showing a person sitting on gold bars. However, the evidence definitively refutes the claim that the person in the photograph is Senator Tom Cotton.  Snopes' investigation shows the photo is of a soldier from the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Iraq in 2003, predating Cotton's military service and unit assignment.  Snopes also notes that Cotton's spokesperson confirmed the man in the photo is not him. Therefore, the caption is accurate in describing the circulation of the photograph but inaccurate in associating it with Senator Cotton.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a soldier sitting amidst a pile of gold bars. The caption claims this is Senator Tom Cotton. Internal and external evidence strongly contradicts this claim.  Internal analysis finds no mention of Senator Tom Cotton in the provided entities.  External evidence from Snopes definitively refutes the claim, stating the photo is of a soldier from the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Iraq in 2003, predating Cotton's military service. Snopes also cites Cotton's spokesperson denying the photo depicts him. Therefore, the caption is misleading and out of context.",

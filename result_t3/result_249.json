Brian Kemp and his mother dressed in KKK garb.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image circulated on social media shows a young boy and a woman dressed in Klu Klux Klan (KKK) robes and hoods, with a caption identifying the pictured persons as now-Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and his mother:\nNo evidence suggests this is actually a picture of the Georgia governor or his mother. The photograph is part of the Bettmann Archive, available through the visual media company Getty Images with a caption noting that the identities of the pictured persons are unknown:\nMore important, Getty Images lists the creation date for this photograph as April 27, 1956. As Brian Kemp was born in 1963, it is not temporally possible that he could be the young boy seen here.",

The image is from 1956, predating Brian Kemp's birth in 1963, making it impossible for him to be depicted.  The identities of the people in the photograph are unknown, according to Getty Images.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies \"Georgia\" as a location. However, external evidence from Snopes definitively refutes the caption's claim.  Snopes confirms that the image predates Brian Kemp's birth, making it impossible for him to be depicted. The image's subjects are unknown, according to Getty Images.  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably false and out of context.",

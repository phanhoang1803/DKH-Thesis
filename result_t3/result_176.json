        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is partially accurate but misleading.  The external evidence confirms that images of a bird (identified variously as a goose or a duck) with a puppy circulated online. However, the evidence strongly suggests the story accompanying the images is fabricated or at least significantly embellished. The claim that the bird was actively keeping the puppy warm to save it from freezing is unsupported.  The original source of the photos is unclear, and Snopes suggests the images originated from Chinese social media in 2017, with a false narrative added later. Therefore, while the core visual element of the caption (bird and puppy together) is confirmed, the emotional narrative and specifics about the event's location and cause are questionable and likely untrue.",
      "supporting_points": "- Snopes confirms photos of a bird and puppy exist and have circulated widely. \n- Snopes states the images likely originate from Chinese social media in 2017. \n- Snopes casts doubt on the story accompanying the images, stating it is suspect and lacks verifiable evidence. \n- The claim about the bird saving a frozen puppy from a pole in Montana is deemed highly improbable and added later to increase the story's impact.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a bird, possibly a goose or duck, with a puppy nestled underneath its wings. While the visual evidence aligns with the caption's core description (bird and puppy together), external evidence from Snopes strongly refutes the narrative that the bird was actively keeping the puppy warm to save it from freezing in Montana. Snopes indicates the images are older, possibly originating from Chinese social media in 2017, and that the story about the bird rescuing a frozen puppy was added later to increase engagement.  Therefore, while the image itself isn't manipulated, the caption's implied narrative is misleading and out of context. The internal check was inconclusive due to the lack of entities for comparison but does not contradict the external findings.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check was inconclusive. External evidence from Snopes casts significant doubt on the narrative accompanying the image, indicating the story is likely fabricated or embellished. The image itself is real, but the context provided in the caption is false."

    "explanation": "The image clearly shows a common kingfisher catching a fish. The location mentioned, Tiszaalpar, Hungary, is consistent with the kingfisher's natural habitat. Internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. Although lacking direct visual confirmation of the exact location, the image and the description are consistent with known facts. Therefore, we can confidently assess that the caption is not out of context. The lower confidence score reflects the limited external evidence available.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption's accuracy. While lacking direct visual confirmation of location, the context is consistent with a kingfisher's behavior and habitat."

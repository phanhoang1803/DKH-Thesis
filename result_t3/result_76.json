    "explanation": "The image shows President Biden signing a document while Vice President Harris observes. This aligns with the caption. However, external evidence fails to verify the specific document being signed as the \"American Rescue Plan\". The internal check identifies key entities but misses the \"White House\" context.  The low confidence score reflects the lack of definitive external verification of the specific legislation signed.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows partial alignment with the caption but lacks crucial location information. External validation fails to confirm the document's identity as the \"American Rescue Plan\", leading to a low overall confidence score."

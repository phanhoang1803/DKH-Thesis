      "explanation": "The caption is plausible.  Army soldiers participating in Republic Day parades in India is a known event.  Soldiers checking their equipment before a parade is also standard procedure. The mention of swords might be less common in modern armies, but ceremonial units or historical reenactments could involve swords.  The date and location are also consistent with Republic Day celebrations. However, I lack specific knowledge of the Indian Army's parade equipment in 2021 to confirm definitively if swords were used.",

    "explanation": "The image strongly supports the caption. A soldier in uniform is clearly shown preparing his sword in a dimly lit setting, consistent with the description of a Republic Day parade rehearsal.  Internal entity analysis confirms the presence of relevant entities ('Indian Army'). External validation provides plausible support based on general knowledge of Republic Day events and army protocols, although certainty is limited due to the absence of direct evidence about the specific parade in 2021. The overall assessment leans towards a likely accurate caption, but the lack of definitive external confirmation keeps the confidence score at 7.",
    "validation_summary": "Image and caption align well; internal entity analysis is positive; external validation is plausible but limited by lack of specific evidence. Overall, a likely accurate caption."

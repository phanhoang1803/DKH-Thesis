Police said that the victim had made the vehicle from scratch, possibly using an online design.\nSergeant Colin Nuttall said there had been a \"collapse in the structure'' when the accident happened about midday on Sunday, with his partner and a next-door neighbour looking on.\nAn engineer is now examining to determine what exactly went wrong.\n\"He took it up there for a test-run. It was the first time he'd tried to drive it, but I'm not sure if it was the first time he'd started it up,\" said Sgt Nuttall.\n\"His partner and neighbour were there at the time, they saw it.\"\nPolice said anyone could build or fly a hovercraft in New Zealand without a licence.\nThe newspaper went on to quote a former member of the Hovercraft Club of New Zealand, Ashley Shaw, who said the craft were generally safe.\n\"To make them, it's a piece of cake. I designed my own,\" he said.\n\"Hovercraft are inherently very, very safe and simple devices. They are quite stable.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that Mr. Read, 55, took up a hobby for the first time a year ago. The provided evidence details the death of Dr. Alastair Kenneth Senior, 40, who died while operating a home-made hovercraft for the first time.  The caption is inaccurate regarding the name, age, and specific circumstances. While both stories involve a first-time hobbyist, the details are completely different. The evidence is from a reputable source (BBC News), making it reliable, but it doesn't support the caption's claims.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a man with a telescope, seemingly an amateur astronomer. The caption mentions Mr. Read, 55, taking up a hobby a year ago.  The internal check flags a mismatch in names (Mr. Read vs. Mike Read). The external check reveals a strong conflict. The BBC News article cited describes a completely different event: the death of Dr. Alastair Kenneth Senior, 40, while using a homemade hovercraft for the first time. This is a significant discrepancy, rendering the original caption inaccurate and out of context. The image provides no evidence to support the caption's details about Mr. Read.",

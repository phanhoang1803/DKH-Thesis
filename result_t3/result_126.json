Source 1 is a collection of photos from Africa, mentioning Reuters, PA, and EPA as picture sources. There is no information about coffin makers in Harare, Zimbabwe, or any related context. The caption lacks supporting evidence from the source, making it impossible to assess its accuracy.",

    "explanation": "The image shows two men working on coffins, seemingly in a workshop. While this aligns with the caption's description of \"coffin makers\", there's no specific information in the image or provided external sources to confirm the location as Harare, Zimbabwe.  The internal entity recognition is unreliable. The external source only offers a collection of photos with no specific details about this image's origin or context. Therefore, the claim of the image depicting coffin makers in Harare, Zimbabwe, lacks sufficient evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal insufficient evidence to confirm the caption's claim about the image depicting coffin makers in Harare, Zimbabwe. The image's visual content shows coffin making, but location verification is missing."

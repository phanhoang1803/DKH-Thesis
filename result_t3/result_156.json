Cameron has a mutated form of leprosy that is so rare, less than one in 600 million people will ever encounter someone who has it.\nThe strain, leprosis metapupalis carnivore, essentially turns its victim into a walking pile of dead skin, rotting flesh, and festering organs while keeping the brain functioning at primal levels and the heart pumping just enough to send diseased blood to the marrow and muscles to allow the person to be mobile.\nThis is not a genuine news item. TheLastLineOfDefense.com is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories, and carries multiple disclaimers labeling its content as fiction:\nIn a cynical world where the news of the day often seems fake, The Last Line of Defense offers today's busy conservative a place to go to read things they'll enjoy and congregate with a bunch of people they agree with. So while everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway.\nDISCLAIMER: Americas Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth.

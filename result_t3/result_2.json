        "content": "Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 15th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.\nUnder the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 15th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.",

The external evidence from Snopes explicitly debunks the claim that President Obama overruled Donald Trump's 2016 election victory and ordered a revote.  Snopes reports that claims of Obama ordering a revote are \"fake news.\" While Snopes mentions an executive order regarding a recount and potential special elections in specific precincts, it clearly states that this was not an overruling of the election result but rather an investigation into alleged voter irregularities.",

    "explanation": "The image depicts Donald Trump with a distressed expression, accompanied by a caption suggesting self-doubt. This image has no direct connection to the news caption claiming that President Obama overruled Trump's election victory.  The internal check correctly identifies the named entities but fails to recognize the factual inaccuracy of the caption. The external check from Snopes definitively debunks the news caption as fake news, providing strong evidence that the caption is out of context.  The visual element is unrelated to the false claim presented in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal entity recognition is accurate, but the caption's factual claim is false. External evidence strongly supports the caption's inaccuracy.  The image is unrelated to the false claim."

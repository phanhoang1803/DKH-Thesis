Several disturbing images from the blackout went viral on social media. One image shared on several different Twitter accounts, however, had nothing to do with that power outage, despite claims to the contrary:\nThe author of the above tweet asserted this image to be taken in Texas during the 2021 blackouts, but this is impossible. The image used in that tweet has been on the internet for years.\nFor example, the image appears in a January 2018 article on EbaumsWorld titled \"36 Amusing Pictures That Will Destroy Your Boredom.\" It can be found, as well, in a December 2019 article about preventing frozen pipes on the website of the company Thompson Building Associates.\nBecause the photo predates the Texas blackout by several years, online claims linking it to current events in Texas are \"False.\"",

However, the external check from Snopes strongly refutes the claim that the image was taken during the Texas blackout in February 2021.

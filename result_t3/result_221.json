        "content": "Claim:\nTed Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.\nOn 28 April 2017, a number of unreliable web sites began publishing stories reporting that rock musician and conservative icon Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident in Montana:\nTed Nugent, 70s rocker turned hunting guide and conservative icon, was shot and killed early this morning in a tragic hunting accident. While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks this claim in two separate articles.  Source 1 directly addresses the death hoax, providing evidence that Nugent was alive and well on the day the rumor spread, citing Facebook Live videos and statements from his spokeswoman. Source 2 further supports this by including the \"Ted Nugent Death Hoax\" article among several other fact-checks on claims related to Nugent, clearly indicating that the death claim is false.",

    "explanation": "The image shows Ted Nugent playing a guitar.  The caption claims that he was killed in a hunting accident. This claim is contradicted by strong external evidence from Snopes, which debunks the death hoax and provides evidence of Nugent being alive on the day the rumor circulated.  The internal check correctly identifies the person mentioned in the caption, but cannot verify the claim of death. The external evidence is significantly more reliable and decisively refutes the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation partially supports the caption by correctly identifying Ted Nugent. However, strong external evidence from Snopes overwhelmingly refutes the claim of his death, making the caption demonstrably false and out of context."

        "content": "LAS VEGAS (AP)  CES, the Consumer Technology Associations annual trade show of all-things tech, is kicking off in Las Vegas this week.\nThe multi-day event, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, is set to feature swaths of the industrys latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care and more  with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Consumer Technology Association bills CES as the worlds largest audited tech event held in-person. Organizers hope to bring in some 130,000 attendees this year. More than 4,000 exhibitors, including over 1,200 startups, are also expected across 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.\nThats still below the headcounts of pre-pandemic years and would mark a 24% dip in attendance compared to the show held in early 2020, just before COVID-19 consumed much of everyday life. But 2024 is on track to beat more recent years. The anticipated numbers would surpass 2023s nearly 118,000 attendees, for example.\nPeople are pumped for this. Theyre pumped because its post-COVID (and) theyre coming back, Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, said. And the CEO level support from around the world has been amazing.\nBig names set to exhibit at CES this year range from tech giants and automakers to leading cosmetics brands  including Amazon, Google, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and LOreal. The show will also spotlight the Consumer Technology Associations partnership with the United Nations Human Security for All campaign, which recently added technology as its eighth human security pillar.\nAfter two days of media previews, CES will run from Tuesday through Friday. The show is not open to the general public -- its a business-to-business event often used for industry professionals to network and connect.\nThe Associated Press spoke with Shapiro about CES 2024 and what to expect this week. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nCES 2024 IS HERE. WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES OF THIS YEARS SHOW?\nThe overall theme of the show, in a sense, is sustainability. Its green. Its the U.N. human securities  including those that focus on clean air, clean water, food as well as health care. And the U.N. just added a new one, which is technology itself. The show is built around these human securities.\nFrom mobility to health care, the exhibiting companies are providing solutions in the post-COVID world. Were also getting older, were living longer and theres fewer people to take care of us. Technology is the answer.\nAI IS EVERYWHERE THIS YEAR. HOW MUCH SAFETY OVERSIGHT IS THERE ON THE DEVICES WELL SEE IN THE COMING DAYS?\nAI is like the internet itself. Its a huge ingredient that will propel so much innovation. The difference is now generative AI, which can learn from what youve done. And you can apply that to so many different aspects of what we do that will make our lives better  especially in a health care area.\nLike any tool since the invention of fire, the government plays a very big role in making sure there are certain safety barriers. Weve been working with the U.S. Senate and theyve been hearing from every interested party about what we need  including a national privacy law. AI is a tool and it can be used for doing tremendous good, or it could be used for doing harm. And we want to focus on the good.\nAUTOMAKERS ALSO HAVE A BIG SPOTLIGHT AT CES. CAN WE EXPECT ANY IMPACT FROM THE RECENT UAW STRIKE?\nIn terms of a trade event, this is like the biggest car event in the world. We see car companies from all over the world on the floor.\nThey will be there in different ways, and some choose not to be here for one reason or another. Certainly the strike had an impact for some of the Detroit companies, but the rest of the companies from around the world are very strong  notably from Europe, Vietnam and Japan.\nWE SAW VIDEO GAME EXPO E3 BITE THE DUST LAST MONTH. WHAT ROLE DO TRADE SHOWS PLAY TODAY AND HOW CAN CESS FUTURE BE ENSURED?\nSince COVID, trade shows have actually become more important for business leaders  because they understand and appreciate that relationship-building. That face-to-face time is very important. A person who goes to CES, for example, has on average 29 different meetings. What is more efficient than that?\nAnd then theres something you cant get online, which is serendipity. Its discovery. Its learning what you dont know and its being inspired. Someone said to me on the way here, I love going to CES because I come back optimistic for the world. I come back with 50 ideas and it energizes me. And thats whats so important. I think we have a great future, and innovation is going to be what fuels us. And we will get there by gathering the worlds innovators together.\n_____________\nVideo producer James Brooks contributed to this report.",

        "content": "LAS VEGAS (AP)  Welcome to CES 2024. This multi-day trade event put on by the Consumer Technology Association is expected to bring some 130,000 attendees and more than 4,000 exhibitors to Las Vegas. The latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more will be on display, with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Associated Press will keep a running report of everything we find interesting from the floor of CES, from the latest announcements to most quirky smart gadgets.\nGYROGLOVE WORKS TO HELP THOSE WITH HAND TREMORS\nRoberta Wilson-Garrett used to be a morning person who would leap out of bed at dawn. Until, that is, she was diagnosed with Parkinsons disease six years ago.\nNow her hands twist and tremor, making the morning, when her medicine is wearing off, especially difficult. It takes hours for her to get ready for the day. All her coffee mugs have lids on them now.\nBoston-based GyroGear, a medical tech startup, debuted a hand-stabilizing glove at CES 2024 that it hopes will help people like Wilson-Garrett regain control of their lives.\nIt makes life normal for me again. The things that you take for granted, I dont take for granted anymore, Wilson-Garrett told AP on the show floor as her right hand shook. It gives me back a piece of my old life when I have the glove on.\nWhen Wilson-Garrett slipped on the black glove, her right hand relaxed, and she was able to hold a pen and write her name.\nThe GyroGlove is now available for $5,899.\nADVANCING AI WITH FORTUNE TELLING\nCan generative AI tell your future? A fortune teller showcased by South Korean manufacturing and IT services giant SK Group at CES this week gives us a glimpse.\nSKs AI Fortune Teller, which is powered by high-bandwidth memory technology, claims that it can tell users their fortune by reading their emotions. The machine snaps a photo of your face and, naturally, asks you to select a card from an on-screen deck. Within moments, the AI analyzes facial characteristics and produces an Tarot card-like print with a short, future-looking message or piece of advice.\nThis AI fortune teller isnt available to consumers outside of CES, but its featured in the Las Vegas show to help display SKs latest tech and sustainability advances. Other attractions advertised at the SK Wonderland interactive exhibit include a fully-electric dancing car and train thats capable of being powered by hydrogen energy\nHYUNDAIS NEW FLYING TAXI CONCEPT LANDS AT CES\nA new flying taxi concept, dubbed the S-A2 by Hyundai, made its debut at CES 2024.\nThe South Korean vehicle manufacturer envisions the electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle as a commuter solution for urban areas with heavy traffic.\nHyundai claims the vehicle will be able to cruise at 120 mph (190 kph) at a 1,500-foot (460-meter) altitude while operating as quietly as a dishwasher.\nThe S-A2 builds on Hyundais S-A1 concept, which made its debut at CES in 2020. Company officials say they are working to get the vehicle ready to meet flight standards set by nations around the world.\nA NO SMOKE INDOOR SMOKER\nGE Appliances is looking to change the way you smoke food with its new $1,000 indoor smoker.\nAbout the size of a toaster oven or microwave, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker can fit a full brisket cut in half, 40 chicken wings or three racks of ribs. It still uses wood pellets to achieve a smokey flavor, but its technology traps the smoke inside, making it perfect for people who live in urban environments, like high-rise apartments, said Whitney Welch, a spokesperson for GE Appliances.\nGAMING ACCESSIBILITY FOR INCLUSION\nA focus on accessibility in the gaming industry is on the rise. Just this October, Sony launched the Access controller for Playstation.\nTo talk about the wins so far and the road ahead, CES 2024 featured a panel of four players for The Evolution of Accessible Gaming.\nFor Paul Amadeus Lane, an accessibility consultant and broadcaster who moderated the panel, gaming is a lifelong passion, but when he got in a car accident that left him unable to use his fingers, he first thought his gaming days were over.\nIt was like I lost a good friend. But then that good friend got reunited when I found out about all these accessibility features, Lane said during the panel.\nMark Barlet, founder of AbleGamers, said people with disabilities are 56% more likely to be socially isolated, and combatting that is what drives his organization. Further, he says its smart business.\nTwenty percent of the population has some sort of disability and you start looking at game companies competing for eyeballs  all of a sudden, talking about, Hey, would you like to sell more games? becomes a really powerful conversation.\nWhen asked what advice theyd give to game developers, panelists Liz Schmidlin, user research lead at PlayStation, and Michele Zorrilla, senior user experience researcher at Insomniac Games, echoed a similar statement: Start working accessibility conversations in early on in the design process.\nBarlet added, Good accessibility is good design.\nYOUR OWN PERSONAL ROBOTIC MASSEUSE\nArtificial intelligence has been seen powering smart home hubs, cars, TVs, medical devices and even fingernail printers at CES 2024. Now its giving massages.\nCreated by French company Capsix Robotics, iYU uses artificial intelligence to perform a real-time body scan and recommend the best kind of experience for the user. A robotic arm then performs a variety of massage techniques.\nWANT A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD FOR YOUR iPHONE?\nIts a new product but the functionality might ring familiar  Clicks Technologies iPhone keyboard is making a splash at CES 2024.\nAccording to co-founder Johnathan Young, the smartphone accessory is aimed at three core audiences: iPhone users with dexterity or accessibility issues, the younger generation looking to stand out, and people who miss their previous smartphone keyboards.\nPrices range from $139 to $159.\nGETTING YOUR VOICE BACK\nDutch startup Whispp aims to use AI to help millions of people suffering from vocal impairments speak again in their natural voices.\nWhile many current technologies focus on speech-to-text or text-to-speech, Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI, resulting in almost real-time speech conversion.\nUsers can recreate their distinct voice by providing recordings of their current or past voice, adding a personalized touch to their own communication.\nAt CES 2024, Whispp launched an AI-powered assistive speech and phone-calling app.\nMARTHA STEWART, TECHNOLOGIST\nOn Tuesday, businesswoman and media personality Martha Stewart took to the kitchen stage at the Samsung CES booth to craft her Martha-tini and smashed potatoes using the companys SmartThings technology.\nAs a bonus, the famed cooking, entertaining and homemaking celebrity revealed how she first got hooked on the tech culture scene.\nWell, I got my first computer in 1982. An IBM. I still have it. ... and all my friends and I would sit up all night long trying to figure out what the computer could do for us.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Rio Yamat, McKinnon de Kuyper and Shawn Chen contributed to this report",

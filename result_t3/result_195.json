Although the Tumblr page stated that their material consisted of \"100% sourced and verified quotes,\" we investigated several of the entries shared by that page and found all of them to be false.\nThe Tumblr page made its agenda clear in its description, \"Get to know the psychopath known as Hillary Clinton a little better.\"\nWe attempted to unearth this quote in the pages of Clinton's 1996 book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, but (unsurprisingly) came up empty-handed.\nThe only credible publication to connect this quote to Hillary Clinton was the Tallahassee Democrat. That connection, however, was posted on 26 October 2015 (a day after the putative quote appeared on the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr page) and appeared in the web site's \"Zing\" section, which features opinions and \"snappy one-liners\" from anonymous users.\nWhile it's true that Hillary Clinton published a book in 1996 called It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, it does not include the statement in question, and Clinton (a parent herself) has not said at any point that she believes children should be raised primarily by the state, with their parents taking a secondary role.",

        "content": "Summary\nOne of Clintons signature claims has come under fire from political foes, quoted by the Boston Globe, who say she doesnt deserve credit for expanding federal health insurance for millions of children.\nWe review the record and conclude that she deserves plenty of credit, both for the passage of the SCHIP legislation and for pushing outreach efforts to translate the law into reality.\nAnalysis\nHillary Clinton has made the claim literally thousands of times, repeating it constantly in her ads, debate appearances and stump speeches. She \"got health insurance for six million kids,\" according to one ad. (The version shown here ran in Texas, but a similar ad also ran heavily in Wisconsin.)\n[TET ]\nClinton Ad: \"Obligation\"Clinton\nNarrator: She fought for universal health care long before it was popular. Got health insurance for six million kids, and expanded access to health care to the National Guard. Now shes the only candidate for president with a plan to provide health care for every American. A top economist calls Hillarys plan the difference between achieving universal health coverage  and falling far short. If you believe health care is Americas moral obligation, join her, Tuesday. Hillary Clinton. Clinton: Im Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. [/TET]\nWe had not previously had reason to question her role in the creation of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) during her husbands administration, but last week the Boston Globe ran a story with the headline, \"Clinton role in health programs disputed.\"\nThe Globe said Clinton \"had little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.\"\nThis was quickly picked up and amplified in various political blogs accusing her of exaggeration and even \"lying.\"\nSo, weve reviewed the Globe story, and the record. The newspaper account quotes a political foe, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, as saying she doesnt deserve credit for the legislation. Hatch cosponsored the legislation and has endorsed the GOPs presumptive nominee, John McCain. The newspaper also said that \"privately, some lawmakers and staff members are fuming\" over Clintons claim but didnt name any of them. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who cosponsored the 1997 legislation that eventually led to the creation of SCHIP, was asked whether Clinton was exaggerating her role. The Globe said he wouldnt criticize Clinton \"directly\" but said: \"Facts are stubborn things  I think we ought to stay with the facts.\"\nKennedy, of course, is now backing Clintons rival, Barack Obama, for the nomination. But last year, before that endorsement, he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying something quite different, which the Globe did not note in its story:\nSen. Edward M. Kennedy, Oct. 6, 2007: The childrens health program wouldnt be in existence today if we didnt have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\nIn that same story, The APs Beth Fouhy concluded, \"While Kennedy is widely viewed as the driving force behind the program, by all accounts the former first ladys pressure was crucial.\" She quoted Nick Littlefield, who had been a senior health adviser to Kennedy, as saying, \"we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\"\nThe APs assessment is backed up by others we consulted. Adam Clymer, former chief Washington correspondent for the New York Times, covered the legislative maneuvering and also wrote about it in a 1999 book, \"Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography.\" Clymer wrote that Kennedy \"worked with\" Hillary Clinton to get White House support for a Senate measure to grant $24 billion for the new program, rather than the $16 billion approved by the House. \"With strong administration support, the $24 billion stayed in,\" he wrote. Then, when the bill finally passed, Kennedy \"credited the President, the First Lady, [Senate Democratic Leader Tom] Daschle, Marian Wright Edelman, head of the Childrens Defense Fun, and Hatch. \"\nClymer, in an exchange of e-mails, told FactCheck.org:\nAdam Clymer: On balance, I would say of course Kennedy and Hatch deserve most of the credit, but Hillary helped by making sure the Administration stuck with the $24 billion in [the Senate-House] conference. She didnt write the legislation but she played a significant role in getting it passed.\nOther accounts at the time the legislation was passed and since give Clinton substantial credit. The pro-Republican Washington Times newspaper credited (or perhaps more accurately, blamed) Hillary Clinton for the program in a 1997 article. The paper said it had obtained documents from 1993 showing that the White House \"plotted\" to push a \"Kids First\" insurance program if Mrs. Clintons universal health care proposal failed.\nWashington Times, Aug. 6, 1997: The plan signed into law yesterday by Mr. Clinton and pushed by the first lady is a duplicate of the 4-year-old health care task force idea, except that it is paid for by a 15-cent tax on cigarettes. One of the co-authors of the plan, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Massachusetts Democrat, credited Mrs. Clinton for her \"invaluable help, both in the fashioning and the shaping of the program.\"\nYears later, when Clinton was first running for the Senate, Kennedys aide Littlefield was still giving her credit. The New York Times quoted him as saying, She was a one-woman army inside the White House to get this done. He said that when President Clinton himself was showing reluctance to back the new legislation out of fear it would upset a budget deal with Republicans, \"We went to Mrs. Clinton and said, Youve got to get the president to come around on this thing, \" and she did.\nMore Than Just Legislating\nMoreover, Hillary Clinton took a major role in translating the new law into action. The program leaves to the states the job of setting up coverage and getting children enrolled, a task that continues to be a struggle to this day. In February 1999, after 47 states had set up SCHIP programs, the Clintons launched a drive to \"Insure Kids Now.\" Hillary took the lead, speaking first before her husband in an East Room event at the White House.\nHillary Clinton, Feb. 23, 1999: At least half of all uninsured children are eligible for federal-state health insurance programs, but too often their parents dont know or dont believe they qualify. As successful, for example, as Medicaid has been, an estimated 4 million eligible children are still not enrolled.\nIn April that year the first lady gave a speech saying nearly 1 million children had been enrolled during the previous year, but that increasing the figure was \"one of the highest priorities\" of her husbands administration. She said the president would seek $1 billion to fund a five-year \"outreach\" effort, with a goal of increasing enrollment to 5 million by 2000. Our conclusion: Clinton is right on this one.\n by Brooks Jackson\nSources\nMilligan, Susan. \"Clinton role in health program disputed.\" The Boston Globe, 14 March 2008.\nGray, Jerry. \"Through Senate Alchemy, Tobacco Is Turned Into Gold for Childrens Health.\" The New York Times, 11 Aug. 1997.\nBedard, Paul. \"Budget a back door to Clintoncare; Childrens health insurance is similar to coverage pushed by Hillary in 93.

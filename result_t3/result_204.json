On Monday one soldier died after a Nato convoy was attacked in Kabul.\nThe Haqqani network, whose leadership is believed to be based in the tribal area of Pakistan, is reported to have a strong presence in several eastern provinces of Afghanistan including Paktika, where the attack took place.\n\"Around 17 of the victims are children between eight to 14 years of age,\" said Maj Gen Siawash, head of the Kabul military hospital. At least 60 people were also wounded.\nIt is thought to be one of the deadliest attacks to hit Afghanistan in recent years. Reports say the crowd gathering to watch the volleyball tournament in a remote district of Paktika was very dense, which is why casualties were so high. People had come from surrounding districts to cheer on their home teams.\n\"I was watching the game, sitting on the ground with my brother, when the blast happened,\" 11-year-old Mohammad Rasuol told the AFP news agency. He was wounded in the chest and his brother is in intensive care, AFP reports.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that Afghans wounded in a blast received treatment in a Kabul hospital on Monday.  Source 1 reports a suicide bombing at a volleyball match in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday, resulting in at least 50 deaths and 60 wounded. While the caption doesn't specify the location of the blast, the source mentions that on Monday, a soldier died after a NATO convoy was attacked in Kabul.  The caption's statement about Afghans being treated in a Kabul hospital on Monday is consistent with the possibility that some of the wounded from either the Sunday bombing or the Monday attack were treated in a Kabul hospital.  However, the caption lacks the specificity to definitively confirm the exact event. The caption is plausible given the events in the source, but it lacks precise details.",

Source 1 mentions that Maj Gen Siawash, head of the Kabul military hospital, reported on the victims of the Sunday bombing.

    "explanation": "The image shows multiple patients in hospital beds, consistent with the caption's description of Afghans wounded in a blast receiving treatment. The internal check correctly identifies \"Kabul\" as a location. The external check finds supporting evidence from news reports of attacks in Afghanistan, including one in Kabul, resulting in injuries. While the exact event depicted isn't definitively pinpointed, the overall context of the image and news reports strongly suggests the caption is accurate.",

The image shows injured people in a hospital, consistent with the news report of casualties from attacks in Afghanistan, including one in Kabul.  While there is a lack of perfect specificity, the contextual plausibility is high."

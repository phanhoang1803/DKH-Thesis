The parody account mimics the distinctive aesthetic and style of NowThis videos. On Twitter, NotThis News describes itself as \"The number one source for 100% totally factual pop culture news,\" but also includes the word \"parody\" in its description.\nThe footage of Drake Bell, star of the Nickelodeon show Drake and Josh, in the NotThis News video is actually taken from his visit to the home of YouTuber Brian Awadis (known as FaZe Rug) in January 2017. Awadis addressed the NotThis News hoax in February 2018, and Bell himself confirmed it was a joke in a phone conversation between the two friends:\nThe tweets in the video are also hoaxes. The first, sent by \"Deborah Brown,\" was actually posted on 16 February 2018, the same day the video was posted. In the video, the tweet is edited to appear as if it was posted in November 2017, garnering 187,000 retweets. In reality, it got two:\nAnd the response \"Let's make it happen brotha\" was never sent by the Make-a-Wish Foundation. NotThis News fabricated it for the purpose of their video.",

    "explanation": "The image shows Drake Bell at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2014. The caption describes a hoax video by \"NotThis News\" involving Drake and Drake Bell. While Drake Bell's presence in the image is relevant to the caption's mention of him, the image itself doesn't directly depict the hoax described in the caption. The image lacks the context of a video, Twitter interaction, or the specific event described. Internal analysis partially aligns with the caption (mentions of Drake and Drake Bell), while external evidence strongly supports the caption's description of the hoax. However, the lack of direct visual connection between the image and the hoax reduces the overall confidence score. Therefore, the caption is out of context concerning the visual provided.",

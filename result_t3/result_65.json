        "content": "Claim:\nSinger Celine Dion died in a plane crash in November 2019.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn November 2019, a video supposedly featuring a CNN news report about the death of singer Celine Dion was widely circulated on social media:\nThis is not a genuine CNN news report, and Dion did not perish in a plane crash.\nThis video is not hosted on CNN.com. Rather, it was posted on websites such as online.newstrends2k18.info and https://worldnews.hytactv.info. These are not a credible sources for news. In fact, these websites don't appear to have a functioning homepage and seem to have been set up simply to host this fraudulent news report.\nViewers who watched this video will notice that the two news anchors never actually say Celine Dion's name. Rather, they say \"we have some terribly sad news to report this morning, heartbreaking, and devastating\" before cutting away to a still image of the singer. That's because the first few seconds of this video come from a news report about the death of a different celebrity: chef Anthony Bourdain.\nHere's the original news report:\nWhoever created the fraudulent video took the first few seconds from CNN's report on Bourdain's death, changed the chyron to read about Dion, and then cut the footage short and replaced it with an image of the singer.\nWe should also note that this fake video started circulating on or prior to Nov. 3, 2019. Since then, Dion has held concerts in Milwaukee and Detroit, something that would be difficult to do after dying in a plane crash:",

        "content": "Celine Dion, Courage (Columbia Records)\nThe search is officially over: If youve been wondering what the saddest song of 2019 is, weve found it. Its on Celine Dions new album, Courage.\nTrack No. 11, For the Lover That I Lost, will have you weeping for two good reasons  one of the songwriters is Sam Smith, that master of grief, while the singer herself is still mourning twin deaths.\nI laid a dozen roses for the lover that I lost/I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost, Dion sings.\nCourage is her first English-language album since the passing of her husband, Rene Anglil, and brother, Daniel, only two days apart in 2016. Dion has dealt with the losses before on her French album Encore un soir, released seven months after the deaths, and this time shes moving gingerly forward.\nThere are soaring ballads of lost love but mostly indicators of hope and perseverance, like when she sings Im flying on my own (on the wings of your love) on Flying on My Own and on the title track, where she vows to keep going: Courage dont you dare fail me now.\nI have missed you, so heavily/But the weights kind of lifting, she sings on the gospel-tinged I Will Be Stronger, adding: I dont feel like giving up just because you climbed off.\nThere are even stems shooting up new love  the 60s throwback How Did You Get Here and the gentle piano ballad written by Skylar Grey called Falling in Love Again. The cover of the album shows Dion walking away from flames, her dress sullied, a woman bowed but not broken.\nSince Dion isnt a songwriter, its not always easy to know what shes going through. But what she chooses to add her titanic voice can tell volumes. And the 16-track Courage is a very strong mature pop album with modern and EDM touches showcasing one of the worlds most jaw-dropping vocalists, this time often rawer than we are used to.\nDion is like a sonic chameleon that changes colors depending on who is nearby and this time Sia is around for two very Sia songs (Baby and Lying Down with David Guetta), but there are also offerings from such longtime collaborators as Liz Rodrigues and Jorgen Elofsson.\nThe standard edition album ends with the spacy, dark and melancholy Perfect Goodbye  and Dion even slips in the rare curse word. Shes angry. Dont need to understand if Gods got a plan/Its out of our hands anyway, she sings. Were just glad her heart will go on.\n______",

Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, debunks this claim in Source 1, citing the video's origin as a manipulated CNN report about Anthony Bourdain's death.

Source 2, an AP News review of Celine Dion's album 'Courage', released in 2019, further supports the refutation of the death claim by implicitly showing she was alive and actively working.

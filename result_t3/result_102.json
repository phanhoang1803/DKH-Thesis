It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

Their investigation reveals the image circulating online is digitally fabricated; the original image predates Trump's campaign, and the Trump-related elements were added later. This directly contradicts the news caption's assertion that Hawn and Russell were seen wearing Trump campaign shirts.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies the entities \"Donald\" and \"Trump\", aligning with the caption's mention of Donald Trump campaign shirts. However, the external check, using Snopes as a reliable source, strongly refutes the caption. Snopes demonstrates that the image is digitally fabricated, with Trump-related elements added to a pre-existing image. This discrepancy signifies a significant out-of-context claim. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially supports the caption, identifying relevant entities. However, external evidence from Snopes conclusively proves the image is digitally manipulated and the caption's claim is false."

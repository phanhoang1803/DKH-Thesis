This disinformation displays TCD's phone number and an incorrect TCD email/web address. THESE IMAGES ARE FAKED TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS. But some people believe them. TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didnt come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely. Thurston County Democrats needs your help fighting fascistic disinformation. www.ThurstonDemocrats.org. Thank you.",

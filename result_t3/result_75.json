        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a bear chasing a skier down a mountain in Romania in January 2021.\nRating:\nTrue\nAbout this rating\nIn 2016, a video went viral that supposedly showed a bear chasing a snowboarder down a mountain. Since that video was fake  it featured computer generated imagery  we were skeptical when we came across a similar video in January 2021 supposedly showing a bear chasing a skier down a mountain.\nThis is a real video.\nThe Romanian news outlet Digi 24 reported that this video was filmed on a ski slope in Predeal, Romania. The incident was filmed by multiple people on the chairlift who watched the scene unfold below. Digi 24 reports that the people on the chairlift yelled (translated via Google):\n\"Give it faster, give it faster! Come on, the bear is chasing you ! Give it faster! God forbid, don't look back!\"\nHere's another video of the incident:\nThe man in the video escaped unharmed.\nIon Zaharia, the county gendarmerie inspectorate, said that when the person realized what was happening, the skier threw a backpack on the ground. This distracted the bear and allowed the person to ski to safety.\nA video report from Obiectiv 3 shows the bear ending the pursuit after finding the bag.\nOfficials on the mountain said that they may  as they have done when similar situations arose in years past  attempt to relocate the bear away from the ski slopes.\nThis incident may seem unusual to some viewers as they have been told (incorrectly) that one way to evade a bear is to run (or ski) downhill. Bears, however, can run downhills at surprising speeds. According to the National Wildlife Federation, bears are nearly as fast as horses, and can reach speeds of 35 mph:\nMyth: Bears cant run downhill.\nIf youre being chased by a bear, dont run downhill! Bears can run as fast as a horse (35 mph), and they can do it uphill, downhill, and everything in between. A bear can outrun you no matter what, so if you see one in the wild do not try to run away from it. Instead, you should stand tall, wave your arms, and talk loudly but calmly. Back away slowly, but stop moving if the bear follows you.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a bear chasing a cyclist down a mountain road.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing a bear chasing a bicyclist down a mountain road has long circulated online, with various humorous captions attached to it over the years. In February 2019, for example, the Facebook page \"Inspire Uplift\" shared the image along with the caption \"Meals on Wheels in Canada\":\nThe original photograph (which featured a bear but no biker) can be traced to a September 2014 post on photographer Adonis Arias' Tumblr page. That posting didn't provide much information about the picture other than it was taken in Yellowstone National Park. (We reached out to Arias for more information but did not hear back prior to publication of this story.)\nHere's a look at the original image (right) and the doctored version (left):",

      "explanation": "Source 1 describes a verified incident of a bear chasing a skier down a mountain.  Source 2 debunks a manipulated image of a bear chasing a cyclist. The news caption mentions a bear chasing a bicyclist down a mountain road. While Source 1 supports the general idea of a bear chasing someone downhill, it does not corroborate the specific details of the caption (cyclist, mountain road). The difference between a skier and a cyclist, and a ski slope and a mountain road, is significant enough to cast doubt on the accuracy of the news caption in relation to the available evidence. The caption's inaccuracy is further highlighted by Source 2's debunking of a similar-themed manipulated image.  Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the caption is considered inaccurate.",

Source 1 verifies a bear chasing a skier, not a cyclist, down a mountain slope. Source 2 debunks a manipulated image with a similar theme, further supporting the inaccuracy of the caption.  The discrepancy between the caption's details (cyclist, mountain road) and the verified event (skier, ski slope) in Source 1 highlights the caption's lack of accuracy. The visual evidence, while seemingly supporting the caption at first glance, is insufficient to outweigh the strong evidence against its accuracy. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context.",

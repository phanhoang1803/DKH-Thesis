      "explanation": "Chelsea Clinton's spouse is Marc Mezvinsky.  While it is possible for a spouse to have family connections to other prominent figures, there's no widely known information linking the Clintons and George Soros through marriage.  The statement requires verification; therefore, confidence is moderate.",

    "explanation": "The image depicts George Soros, but the caption claims Chelsea Clinton is married to his nephew. This claim is contradicted by external evidence showing Chelsea Clinton's spouse is Marc Mezvinsky. Internal entity analysis also finds inconsistencies, with some entities related to an economics festival which are irrelevant to the caption.  The visual evidence only shows George Soros, offering no support for the marriage claim. Therefore, the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly suggest the caption is inaccurate. The image shows George Soros, but the caption's claim about Chelsea Clinton's marriage is false according to external sources and lacks visual support."

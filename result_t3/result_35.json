      "confidence_score": 4,
      "explanation": "The caption describes a plausible scenario. Giraffes are known to inhabit the areas mentioned (Amboseli National Park, Chyulu Hills, Tsavo), and the existence of wildlife corridors and electric fences (to deter animals from entering certain areas or crossing roads) is also realistic.  The date is plausible. The only uncertainty is the specific placement of the electric fence - while it's possible, it's not something I can confirm without more detailed knowledge of that particular sanctuary.  However, overall the description is consistent with general knowledge of wildlife management in African national parks and the behaviors of giraffes.",
      "supporting_points": "Giraffes inhabit East Africa, including Kenya; Amboseli National Park, Chyulu Hills, Tsavo are real and known wildlife areas; electric fences are used in wildlife management; wildlife corridors exist to link protected areas; February 8, 2021 is a valid date.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The image shows a giraffe crossing a road, seemingly near some sort of infrastructure that could be interpreted as an electric fence. This aligns with the caption's description of a giraffe crossing a road in a wildlife sanctuary, although no fence is explicitly visible. The external assessment points to the plausibility of the overall scenario. However, the lack of direct visual evidence regarding the electric fence lowers the confidence score. The internal check lacks sufficient data for a thorough assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "The image generally supports the caption, but the absence of explicit visual confirmation of the electric fence leads to a lower confidence score. External knowledge supports the plausibility of the scene, but the assessment remains knowledge-based."

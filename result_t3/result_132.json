        "content": "Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

        "content": "While overfishing threatens fish stocks in many parts of the world, Maine's lobster population keeps on growing. It's all thanks to a few simple measures that ensure adult males and females get plenty of opportunity to meet, and reproduce.\nRush hour starts early in Boothbay Harbour. Newcomers to this little town in Maine are woken by diesel engines at half past four in the morning. It is not the roar of trucks but a low throb and thrum.\nAfter a while it is reassuring, restful - the sound of the lobster boats heading out.\nThey are not large - about 35 feet long (around 10 metres), some crewed by their owner alone, most with one hired hand, the stern-man.\nThey stream out in the morning and come home in the evening, like city commuters.\nBut the lobsterman's commute is more impressive - past rocky islets, under ospreys nesting on marker poles, surprised by seals suddenly alongside, porpoises and sometimes mighty whales.\nFrom the shore out beyond the reefs and islands, the surface of the sea is dotted with brightly coloured cylinders 1ft (30cm) tall, curving to a point at the bottom, each with a short pole sticking out of the top, like giant anglers' floats.\nAttached to each of these thousands of buoys - boo-ees, they call them here - is a pair of lobster traps.\n\"There are more than 200 boats in the area,\" Glenn Townsend, the assistant harbourmaster tells me, \"each licensed to set up to 600 traps, and they tend to fish to the limit.\"\nI could not see how the lobster stock could withstand the onslaught.\nBut Finn Carroll, sternman on the Optical Illusion, says the lobster population is growing, because of - rather than in spite of - the fishing.\n\"There are strict controls,\" Finn explains, over a Dogfish Head (that's a beer, not a seafood delicacy) in Robinson's Wharf.\n\"If we catch a berried hen, a female carrying eggs, we cut a v-notch in the right flipper next to the middle of her tail. Then we put her back. You can't land a notched lobster.\"\nIt takes two moults for the notch to grow out, so the female has a chance to spawn for at least another two years.\n\"They have to be 3.25 inches (8cm) from the eye socket to where the tail begins. Any shorter, they go back.\"\nMany fisheries have minimum size limits. In Maine, there is also an upper limit.\nIf a lobster is more than five inches (12.5 cm) from eye to tail, it goes back too.\nMany will be male so, as well as a high proportion of breeding females, this ensures there are lots of big, mature males scuttling about the seabed.\nBoothbay lobster traps are carefully designed - for the comfort and safety of crustaceans.\nThey will not damage their claws on the way in, and the bars are spaced so that the little ones can come and go.\nTo avoid \"ghost fishing\", one wall is biodegradable so, should a trap be parted from its boo-ee and lost, its inmates will be able, after a bit, to stroll free.\nI think, in my next life, I would like to be a five-inch-plus male lobster in Maine - as much food as I can eat, with all that bait, lots of girls and always a lobster trap handy to shelter in from predators.\n\"If it wasn't for us, there wouldn't be nearly as many lobsters,\" Finn says. \"They're usually solitary, fighting for scarce food, even eating each other. What we're doing is more farming than fishing, really.\"\nAt $2.75 (1.75) per pound or $6 (3.80) a kilo, that is a good day's work.\nSo it is no wonder that lobster fishing in Boothbay Harbour is not the easiest of industries to get into.\nThe number of permits is limited. Sons tend to take over from their fathers. But if you serve your time (at least two years) as a sternman, there is a chance you will get one.\nThere is a lot to learn - the lore as well the law.\nEach lobsterman's buoys are painted differently.\nI show Finn one that I found washed up. He knows whose it is immediately.\nTheoretically, lobstermen can set their traps anywhere. In reality, people have territories and, if one person intrudes on another's - as might have happened here - his gear will be cut.\nAs well as the chart in his boat, the lobsterman carries another in his head.\nCutting gear is one thing, stealing lobsters from another fisherman's traps quite another.\nFinn tells me of a lobsterman with an expensive narcotics habit who was caught doing this.\nFisheries protection officers coated a suspicious fisherman's trap lines with an ink that shows up under ultraviolet light.\nThe culprit's hands glowed a guilty purple.\n\"He lost everything,\" Finn whispers, \"his license, his boat, everything. He had to leave town.\"\nHow to listen to From Our Own Correspondent:\nBBC Radio 4:\nA 30-minute programme on Saturdays, 1130.\nSecond 30-minute programme on Thursdays, 1100 (some weeks only).\nListen online or download the podcast\nBBC World Service:\nHear daily 10-minute editions Monday to Friday, repeated through the day, also available to listen online.\nRead more or explore the archive, external at the programme website, external.",

        "title": "Whole Foods drops Maine lobster, citing risk to endangered whales : NPR",
        "date": "2022-11-30T13:39:51",
        "content": "Whole Foods will temporarily stop buying Maine lobster for its stores nationwide in a move that's drawing praise from environmentalists and anger from local politicians and industry.\nThe grocery chain made the decision in response to warnings from the two separate seafood-monitoring groups it relies on to certify the sustainability of its products. Both groups had downgraded Maine lobster in recent months, citing concerns about the impact of certain fishing practices on the endangered North Atlantic right whale.\nSeafood Watch  a program of California's Monterey Bay Aquarium  assigned a \"red\" rating to Maine lobster in September. It recommended that consumers avoid lobster caught by trap in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank, since that gear (particularly with vertical lines) poses an entanglement risk to the endangered whales. That decision prompted some retailers, including meal kit companies Hello Fresh and Blue Apron, to stop selling lobster.\nAnd in mid-November, the environmental nonprofit Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) announced that it would suspend its sustainability certificate for the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery, citing failure to comply with federal conservation standards (though also noting there is no evidence to show that the fishery is responsible for entanglements of right whales). The suspension takes effect Dec. 15.\nThat's where Whole Foods comes in. Company sourcing standards established in 2012 dictate that all wild-caught seafood sold in its stores must be from fisheries that are either certified by the MSC or rated green or yellow by Seafood Watch, as Whole Foods explained in a statement.\nThe chain says it is pausing purchases of Maine lobster until one of those things changes, but anticipates the seafood will still be available on supermarket shelves for some time. Lobster that was purchased while still MSC-certified or under an MBA yellow rating will continue to be sold in stores, presumably in the frozen aisle.\n\"We are closely monitoring this situation and are committed to working with suppliers, fisheries, and environmental advocacy groups as it develops,\" says a spokesperson.\nWhat lobster fishing has to do with endangered whales\nNorth Atlantic right whales have been classified as endangered since 1970, with the latest estimates suggesting there are fewer than 350 alive today. They have experienced an \"ongoing Unusual Mortality Event\" since 2017, meaning a significant number are dying in a short period of time.\nOne of the greatest threats the dwindling population faces is entanglement in fishing gear. An estimated 85% of right whales have been caught up in fishing gear at least once, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries estimates. It can cause serious injuries and infections and, even if removed, can stress or weaken a whale in such a way that prevents it from swimming, eating or even reproducing.\nU.S. and Canadian fisheries combined deploy up to 1 million vertical lines throughout the whales' migratory routes, calving and foraging area, according to data shared by Seafood Watch. It says that because the vast majority of entanglements can't be linked to a specific gear type or location, until there is more evidence, \"all of the fisheries using this gear are considered a risk.\"\nOnly about 16 of the 1,600 entanglement scars and incidents evaluated by New England Aquarium researchers have been traced back to a fishing location, NOAA spokesperson Andrea Gomez told NPR over email.\nHowever, she added, NOAA has documented several large whale entanglement incidents involving Maine lobster gear since Maine fisherman began marking their gear in purple, a new requirement as of 2020.\n\"Given the low number of right whales, documented entanglements are more rare, but even one serious injury or mortality exceeds the Potential Biological Removal level established by the Marine Mammal Protection Act,\" Gomez explained.\nFederal conservation laws renew scrutiny on Maine lobster\nRecent years have ushered in federal efforts to make lobster fishing practices safer for whales in Maine and other states.\nAmong them, NOAA has implemented new regulations requiring fisheries to reduce the number and strength of lines in the water, among other measures to reduce the risk of entanglement. It's also working with fishermen and environmental organizations to develop safer forms of gear and methods, like ropeless traps.\nRight whales are protected under federal conservation laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act, which are implemented by NOAA (which is part of the Department of Commerce).\nA federal court ruled this summer that the new regulations, while intended to protect right whales, does not fully meet the legal obligations that fixed-gear fisheries have for doing so.\nThat's what prompted the MSC to review the sustainability certification of the Maine lobster fishery. It says its most recent assessment did not find any evidence that the fishery is responsible for \"entanglements or interactions with right whales\"  but also that it's not doing enough to safeguard them.\nAn MSC spokesperson explained to NPR over email that one performance indicator  which requires that any management strategy involving right whales is highly likely to achieve the national requirements for that species' protection  fell below the minimum required score.\nThis is not the first time the MSC has suspended its certification for the Maine lobster fishery  it did so in August 2020 for what it calls similar reasons. (Whole Foods did not pause purchases at the time, its spokesperson clarifies, because the Seafood Watch still rated Maine lobster as yellow).\nEnvironmental groups are applauding Whole Foods' decision to stop procuring Maine lobster for the time being.\n\"With fewer than 340 North Atlantic right whales in existence, the species is swimming toward extinction unless things turn around,\" Virginia Carter, Save America's Wildlife Campaign associate with Environment America, said in a statement. \"We appreciate that the grocer paused lobster purchases from the Gulf of Maine, one of the places where lobster ropes threaten the few remaining right whales we have left.\"\nMaine politicians and lobster fishers are not as much on board\nThe changes in lobster ratings, and Whole Foods' resulting decision, has been met with less enthusiasm in Maine.\nMaine's governor and congressional delegation released a joint statement last week expressing their disappointment with moves by Whole Foods and the MSC, which it said \"wrongly and blindly decided to follow the recommendations of misguided environmentalist groups rather than science.\"\n(When asked to comment on this accusation, the MSC spokesperson clarified to NPR that fisheries enter the MSC program voluntarily to be assessed against its standard  which focuses on healthy fish populations, minimum environmental impact and effective management  and that a third-party auditor is responsible for those assessments, certifications and suspensions).\nThe Maine politicians stressed that their state's lobstering community has \"consistently demonstrated their commitment to protecting right whales\" and that there has never been a right whale death attributed to Maine lobster gear.\nThey said the suspension of the sustainability certificate harms the livelihoods of working people, and strongly urged the MSC and retailers to \"reconsider their potentially devastating decisions.\"\nThe Maine lobster fishery employs more than 5,600 independent lobstermen, harvests over 100 million pounds of lobster annually and contributes more than a billion dollars to the state's economy every year, according to the industry group Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative.\nMaine touted 2021 as the most valuable year in the history of its lobster fishery, with its landed value of nearly $725 million marking a 75% increase over 2020 and \"by far the single largest increase in value, year over year.\"\nMarianne Lacroix, the executive director of the Collaborative, has called Whole Foods' decision disappointing, according to Maine Public.\n\"The fishermen have been working for 25 years to ensure that their gear is safe for right whales,\" she said. \"So for a major customer not to carry the product, it's not just disappointing but obviously can also impact their businesses.\"",

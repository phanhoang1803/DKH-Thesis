      "explanation": "The entities are correctly identified and their usage aligns with the caption. Bailey is correctly identified as a person. London and Regent's Park are correctly identified as locations. The I-LOC tags for \"s\" and ' are also correct as they are part of the location name.",

    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 4,
      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Cockapoos are a popular dog breed, and Regent's Park in London is a public park where people frequently walk their dogs.  There is nothing inherently improbable about a cockapoo named Bailey having a morning walk there. The caption is short and simple, typical of a caption in a news story or social media post that might accompany a photo.",
      "supporting_points": "Cockapoos are a common dog breed; Regent's Park is a real place in London and is open to the public; people walk their dogs in parks; the caption's simplicity is consistent with typical news captions.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The image shows a cockapoo-type dog sitting on a park bench. The setting appears consistent with a park in London.  Internal and external checks support the caption's claim. However, the evidence is primarily knowledge-based, lacking explicit confirmation of the dog's name or precise location within Regent's Park. This limits the confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal and external checks both support the caption, but the lack of direct visual evidence for the dog's name and precise location in Regent's Park reduces confidence."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video documents the U.S. Navy's wasteful practice of launching pickup trucks into the water.\nOn 9 February 2019, the Facebook page \"The Other 98%\" posted a video that supposedly showed a truck being launched via a catapult off the deck of the USS Gerald Ford. The video was accompanied by a message suggesting that the United States could easily afford to pay for the Green New Deal proposed in Congress or Medicare for all since the Navy was wasting so much money dumping trucks into the water:\nThe text overlaid on the video reads: \"Trucks were just launched off the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to test its jet catapult system. Don't ever let anyone tell you we can't afford Medicare for all or the Green New Deal.\"\nSeveral things are wrong with this assertion:\nThis incident didn't \"just\" happen. The video is from 2015.\nThe object being launched is not a commercially available truck. This is actually a weighted sled (referred to by the Navy as a dead load).\nThese sleds can be retrieved from the bottom of the river.\nEconomic estimates for the proposed Green New Deal or Medicare for All vary, but they can't be compared to the cost of a few wasted pickup trucks.\nThis viral clip originated with a video uploaded to the U.S. Navy's YouTube page in 16 June 2015 and shows a test of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), a catapult system designed to launch aircraft. At the time, the Navy was using dead loads to mimic the weight of an aircraft:\nHere's a better look at the \"truck\" in the video:\nThe viral Facebook video suggests that the Navy was being wasteful, as these \"trucks\" were lost and left to decay in the water. But that's not always the case. These tests were conducted in the relatively shallow waters of the James River (as opposed to the ocean) and can usually be retrieved for additional tests. A contemporary report from Engadget noted that this specific sled (which was not equipped with any electronics, an engine, or any other especially expensive materials) was recovered from the James River:\nThe Navy has been testing the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System or EMALS for months aboard the Gerald R. Ford carrier, but this is the first time a \"dead-load\" (or a weighted steel sled that weighs up to 80,000 pounds) is involved. Its advantages over traditional catapults that use steam instead of electromagnetic energy include smoother acceleration and its ability to place less stress on the aircraft -- plus, it was designed to work even with more advanced carriers that the military will surely use in the future. It will take a long time before any plane goes near the system, though: the Navy has already retrieved the sled above from the depths of the James River to conduct more dead-load launches.\nIn July 2017, the first fixed-wing airplane was launched using EMALS:\nWhile one could certainly argue that the U.S. government wastes money on certain projects that would be better spent on more worthwhile endeavors, this viral Facebook video isn't the best example to support this argument. This \"truck\" is actually a weighted sled and wasn't lost to the water.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is partially accurate but misleading.  The external evidence confirms that an object was launched from the USS Gerald Ford using a catapult system. However, the object was not a \"truck\" but a weighted sled used to test the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). The caption misrepresents the nature of the object launched.  The source is reliable; it's a fact-check article from Snopes, which thoroughly investigates the claim and presents supporting evidence from the US Navy's own YouTube channel and news reports. While the event happened, the description of the object launched is inaccurate.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that the object launched was not a truck but a weighted sled, referred to as a 'dead load' by the Navy. It further clarifies that this sled was used to test the EMALS system and that the video in question is from 2015, not a recent event. The source also notes that the sled was recovered from the James River after testing. The fact-check debunks the implication of wasteful spending by highlighting the retrievability of the sled and its purpose as a testing device.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a large aircraft carrier at sea. A helicopter is visible on the deck. The caption claims a truck was launched via a catapult. This is contradicted by external evidence which shows that the object launched was a weighted sled used to test the EMALS system, not a truck. The external source is reliable, and the internal check shows inconsistency in named entities. The visual evidence does not show any trucks or the act of launching one. The news caption is misleading and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The image shows an aircraft carrier, but the claim about launching a truck is false according to reliable external evidence. The object was actually a weighted sled used for testing."

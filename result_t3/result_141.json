        "content": "Bereaved families call for more support as crash investigation continues\nAdam Goldsmith\nLive reporter\nSince the Jeju Air plane crashed at Muan International Airport on Sunday, hundreds of the victims' family members have camped at the airport.\nBereaved families are waiting on the release of their loved ones' bodies, and have expressed frustration at a lack of timely updates from Jeju Air and government officials.\nAll 175 passengers and four members of the crew were killed in the crash, two flight staff survived and remain in hospital.\nA period of seven days mourning has been announced by the countrys acting president Choi Sang-mok, as flowers have been laid at the scene.\nInvestigators are looking into the planes black box recordings but decoding them may be delayed due to damage, as the search for the cause of the crash continues.\nIn addition, a \"comprehensive inspection\" of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft is underway, and a team from the US is set to join South Koreas aviation authority in its investigation.\nWere now closing our live coverage of this story, but the BBC has more on the victims families anxious wait after the deadliest aviation disaster on South Korea soil.\nWant more on this story?\nWe'll soon be closing our live coverage but before we go, the BBC has more on this story:\nFrom the runway: The BBCs Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports live from the airfield, piecing together what steps will come next as investigators search debris at the scene.\nWhat we know: A full read on what we know about the crash so far - including who the victims are and how officials are responding.\nA bird strike? Theres been strong speculation that the crash was caused by a so-called bird strike - find out why air traffic control warned pilots about avian activity here.\nMourning families: Hear what families - who have gathered in Muan airport - have to say about their anxious wait for the release of their loved ones' bodies.\nFlights cancelled and calls for support: What are officials doing now?\nKelly Ng\nBBC News\nActing President Choi Sang-mok has has ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operations.\nMuan has also been declared a special disaster zone, which makes central government funding available to the local government and victims.\nAll flights to and from Muan International Airport have been cancelled.\nA national seven-day period of mourning has been declared, and New Year's Day celebrations in the country are likely to be cancelled or scaled down.\nAircraft maker Boeing has said it is in touch with Jeju Air and stands \"ready to support them\".\nJeju Air has apologised to families, with its chief executive saying in a news conference that the airline had no history of accidents. It is believed that Sunday's crash has been the airline's only fatal accident since it was launched in 2005.\nYou can read more about the crash, and what has happened since, in our explainer piece\nPlane made 13 flights in the 48 hours before crash - report\nThe plane that crashed at Muan airport on Sunday had operated 13 flights in the 48 hours prior to the crash, the Yonhap news agency reports., external\nIt says industry sources have raised concerns about whether Jeju Air may have overextended itself by scheduling excessive charter flights during the peak end-of-year season. This overextension of the plane's capacity would be dependent on the the type of aircraft and length of the routes it takes.\nRegional airports in South Korea are reliant on charter flights operated by low-cost airlines, this type of airline tends to have a higher utilisation rate - a measure of how often a plane is used.\nThe report from Yonhap, citing Jeju Air's own data, says the airline had the highest average monthly flight time among the six domestic low-cost airlines in South Korea, between July and September this year.\nConcrete mound on the runway - what's the significance?\nThe ongoing investigation into yesterday's deadly crash could be delayed by damaged black boxes - flight recording devices. In the meantime, investigators are considering the significance of the location of a concrete mound that the aircraft collided with at the end of the runway.\nThis concrete structure holds a navigation system that assists aircraft landings - known as a localiser - according to the Yonhap News Agency,\nSouth Koreas transport minister says some of the country's other airports have the same localisers installed with concrete exteriors.\nThe four metre-tall mound of concrete is covered with dirt and located about 250m (820ft) from the end of the runway. Video footage shows that the plane crash landed part way down the runway before hitting the mound.\nOfficials have not suggested that the concrete structure is dangerous, or a factor in the crash, but Reuters news agency has spoken to a flight safety expert who called the structure \"unusual\".\nChristian Beckert, who is also a Lufthansa pilot based in Munich, says: \"Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you don't have a wall.\"\nIndication of electrical fault in 'perplexing crash', aviation expert suggests\n\"This is one of the most perplexing crashes I have ever seen. Nothing about it makes any sense,\" aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas tells the BBC.\nSpeaking from Perth, he notes that while a bird strike may have played a role, once the pilot issued a mayday call the air traffic control data cut out.\nThe sudden loss of data - which allows the flights to be tracked - \"indicates an electrical fault of some kind\", Thomas suggests.\nFollowing the call, the plane was also allowed to land in the opposite direction to usual.\nBut the wheels were up, the flaps not set correctly and it landed halfway down the runway before careering into the localiser and exploding, he says.\nThomas says there are workarounds if an electrical or hydraulic problem arises, but these were not used.\n\"It just doesnt make any sense. We're going to have to wait for voice recorder details before we can get a handle on what on earth went on.\"\nJeju Air passengers cancel flight bookings en masse\nSince yesterday's fatal incident, Jeju Air's website has remained blank, with a black banner tribute at the top of the site.\nThe banner reads: \"We deeply apologise to those affected by the incident. We will make every effort to resolve the situation. We sincerely regret the distress caused.\"\nNow, Jeju Air passengers have been cancelling tickets for future flights, according to Yonhap news agency.\nIt reports that some 68,000 flight reservations had been cancelled as of 13:00 local time (04:00 GMT), including 33,000 domestic flights and 34,000 international journeys.\nThe news agency adds that travel agencies across South Korea are reporting a high number of cancellations from passengers, as well as a drop in the number of bookings.\n'My 97 year old mum has been crying all day, my brother was such a good son'\nAs we bring you updates on authorities' challenge to identify those killed in yesterday's crash, we're also hearing stories from the family members left behind.\nEarlier, one man described how he had lost three relatives in the incident, while others reportedly passed out and wailed as the names of the deceased were read out at the airport.\nOne woman, Ms Yoo, explained how her brother is one of the 179 victims.\n\"He went to an event in (the province of) Jeollanam-do with former work colleagues,\" she says.\n\"It's heart-breaking. Unexpected things happened. My brother was such a good son to my 97-year-old mother. She couldn't sleep, I felt so sorry for her. She has been crying all day. She says she misses him already.\"\nWho are the plane crash victims and survivors?\nWe've just reported that DNA samples \"will not be immediate\". Officials have been collecting saliva samples from family members gathered at Muan Airport to help identify bodies of victims. Other victims have been identified by their fingerprints.\nAuthorities have so far identified 141 bodies.\nFive of the people who died were children under the age of 10. The youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was 78, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.\nSouth Korea's National Fire Agency said two members of flight crew - a man and a woman - survived the crash. They were found in the tail side of the aircraft after the crash and taken to hospital, it said.\nThe man has woken up and is \"fully able to communicate,\" according to Yonhap, which cites the director of the Seoul hospital where he is being treated.\nVictims' families demand more government support\nAs South Korea's interim president meets with victims families', their representative is pushing for more support from the country's government.\nPark Han Shin's brother died in the crash, and he is now representing the families of the other 178 who died. He has demanded that more experts be brought in to help with identification.\n\"We want [the government] to recover our families 100% or at least 80% as soon as possible,\" he tells reporters.\nAnd, with some families losing multiple members in the crash, the representative says compensation from Jeju Air is needed immediately.\n\"The only way for bereaved families to feel that (Jeju Air) has done everything it can is to help bereaved families financially,\" he explains.\n\"Parents of a family have passed away. There are only kids left and how can they live on their own? This is something neither the province officials nor the government can help with.\"\nBereaved 'wailed and passed out' as names of deceased read out\nThe atmosphere at Muan airport - the site of the deadly Jeju Air plane crash - is one of \"deep devastation\", South Korean journalist Nemo Kim tells the BBC.\nThere is a \"deep sense of grief, shock\", she says, recalling how the family members of the deceased were \"wailing and passing out\" as the names of the deceased were read out at the airport.\nSpeaking from the South Korean capital, Seoul - where she has now returned after reporting from the airport - Kim says the bereaved are also frustrated at the lack of \"timely updates\" from Jeju Air.\nShe says the families feel the airline is prioritising \"media damage control\" by holding a press conference in Seoul rather than addressing their concerns on site.\nJeju Air previously apologised to families, with its chief executive saying in a news conference that the airline had no history of accidents.\nIn the aftermath, the search for the cause continues\nIn the aftermath of the plane crash, officials have been searching through the debris as an investigation into what caused the fatal incident has been launched - with assistance from the US.\nReports have been circulating that a bird strike, a collision between a plane in flight and a bird, is a possible factor. At 08:59 yesterday morning, as we've just reported in our timeline, air traffic control gave a cautionary warning about bird activity, minutes later the plane crash-landed.\nVideo footage shows that the plane touched down without wheels or any other landing gear and skidded down the runway.\nWhen a plane crashes, black boxes - sometimes known as flight recorders - are the key source of information for investigators.\nThese recorders store data including fuel, speed and trajectory as well as conversations within the cockpit and with air traffic control.\nAn investigator has suggested this data may take up to a month to decode due to damage.",

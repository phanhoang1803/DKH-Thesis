        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\nOrigin\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\" This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the Mexico City policy  commonly referred to as the global gag rule. The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot  unlike the global gag rule  be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that bodys sexual and reproductive health agency whose mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young persons potential is fulfilled.\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the domestic gag rule  a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. Organizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services, the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went a step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations. Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  President Joe Biden on Thursday rescinded a regulation that barred U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform or promote abortions. His decision, while expected, was cheered by abortion-choice advocates and some humanitarian groups and denounced by anti-abortion groups.\nThe move also included a restoration of American funding to the U.N. Population Fund and withdraws the U.S. from an international accord that promotes anti-abortion policies. The steps came just a week after he was inaugurated and fulfills a campaign pledge to reverse a policy that previous Republican presidents, including his immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, had instated immediately on taking office.\nThe policy  known as the Mexico City rule, after the place where it was first announced at an international population conference, or the global gag rule  has been a political ping-pong ball, bouncing back and forth between Republican and Democratic presidents since it was first enacted in 1985 during President Ronald Reagans second term.\nThese excessive conditions on foreign and development assistance undermine the United States efforts to advance gender equality globally by restricting our ability to support womens health and programs that prevent and respond to gender-based violence, Biden said in a memorandum to his Cabinet.\nThe expansion of the policy has also affected all other areas of global health assistance, limiting the United States ability to work with local partners around the world and inhibiting their efforts to confront serious health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others, he said. Such restrictions on global health assistance are particularly harmful in light of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAccompanying Bidens determination was a decision to restore funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which Trump had ended over its alleged support for forced abortions and sterilizations in China. The fund has denied those allegations. The year before Trump terminated the funding, the U.S. had provided $69 million to the UNFPA.\nIn addition, Biden directed the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw from the so-called Geneva Consensus, an October 2020 document signed by 34 countries that sought to promote anti-abortion policies and others deemed pro-family worldwide. The consensus had been co-sponsored by the U.S. and was signed by numerous nations critics consider to be undemocratic or authoritarian.\nCritics of Trumps policies say they had hurt womens reproductive health care and contributed to poverty worldwide. Supporters argue they are essential to preserve the sanctity of life.\nTrump had expanded the Mexico City rule to include nearly all federal health funding, but its effects were felt most abroad, where U.S. assistance can be an essential part of a countrys health care spending.\nAlthough supporters of the policy argue that the overall amount of U.S. health care aid was not affected, critics maintain it contributed to a rise in pregnancy-related complications as well other issues by forcing some clinics to reduce broader health services, including for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious diseases, if they wanted to retain funding.\nReaction to Bidens decision was swift and sharp, even before it was officially announced. Abortion-rights groups and Democratic lawmakers hailed it as key to improving womens lives, while anti-abortion groups denounced it as immoral and unnecessary.\nThe Global Gag Rule has had a sweeping effect on lifesaving health care in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world, said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the only woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is shameful that the Trump administration chose to not only implement but exponentially expand this ill-conceived policy to historic proportions.\nShe called it an important first step to restore access to family planning services and mitigate the damage caused by an administration that pursued this dangerous policy without regard for its impact.\nDoctors Without Borders, which has spoken out against the Mexico City policy, welcomed the move but said more must be done to address the global health care crisis.\nWhile we are relieved to see a halt to this dangerous policy, there is much more work to do to mitigate the damage we have witnessed. Rescinding the Global Gag Rule is just a first step, it said. Millions of women still dont have access to safe abortion care because of restrictive laws, cost, stigma, a lack of trained providers, or other unnecessary barriers, such as mandatory waiting periods or misleading information.\nAnti-abortion groups and lawmakers were equally as strident in their condemnation.\nU.S. foreign policy  and the foreign entities we fund with billions of dollars in grant money  should consistently affirm, care for, and tangibly assist women and children  including unborn baby girls and boys, said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who has been one of the most vocal abortion opponents in Congress.\nFunneling U.S. tax dollars to abortion groups overseas is an abhorrent practice that flies in the face of the unity Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promised to inspire, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which seeks to elect anti-abortion candidates to Congress and other offices.\nEchoing the comments of others, she blasted the Biden administration for once again allowing taxpayer money to fund abortions, maintaining the move was payback for a group of abortion industry giants that support the presidents campaign for president.\nPushing abortion on other nations is not compassion, it is ideological neo-colonization, said Lila Rose of Live Action, a national anti-abortion group. This decision is a dark day for our nation  it will lead to more deaths of more children and for that, Joe Biden should be ashamed.",

        "content": "US President Joe Biden has reversed a ban on federal funds going to international aid groups that perform or inform about abortions.\nHe said the ending of the so-called Mexico City Policy reverses former President Trump's \"attack on women's health access\".\nThe memo orders a review of a Trump-era policy blocking funding for US clinics that offer abortion referrals as well.\nMr Biden also signed an edict expanding the Obamacare insurance programme.\n\"I'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law,\" he said in the White House Oval Office on Thursday, responding to criticism that he was governing by executive order, rather than congressional legislations.\n\"There is nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act ... to the way it was before Trump became president,\" he added.\nWhat is the global abortion 'gag rule'?\nThe Mexico City Policy was first enacted by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and has been repeatedly renewed by Republicans and cancelled by Democrats.\nFor decades, the US has barred money from being spent on overseas abortions but the Mexico City policy takes that a step further. It prevents federal funds from going to organisations that provide abortions, abortion counselling or advocate for the legal right to abortion.\nThe programme was expanded under Mr Trump, who banned funds from going to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that themselves provide funding for abortion groups.\nIn a statement earlier, the White House said Mr Biden was issuing the presidential actions \"to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally\".\nA report by the US Government Accountability Office released last year found that in 2017, NGOs were unable to receive around $153m (112m) because they chose not to cut back on abortion programmes.\nThe report found 54 occasions in which NGOs did not accept US funds due to the policy.\nWhat else has Biden done on abortion?\nMr Biden has also instructed the US health department to immediately consider removing Trump-era restrictions to a domestic family planning programme for low-income Americans known as Title X.\nMr Trump's overhaul of the Title X programme saw tens of millions of dollars stripped from any health centres that offered or referred patients for non-elective abortions, like Planned Parenthood.\nMr Biden on Thursday also removed the US from a 2020 resolution known as the Geneva Consensus, a non-binding charter of more than 30 countries that oppose abortion.\nThe actions to begin undoing Mr Trump's abortion and healthcare legacy comes on the eve of the annual anti-abortion March for Life protest, which is being held virtually on Friday. In 2020, Mr Trump made history by becoming the first sitting US president to appear at the rally.\nIt also comes amid legal battles over abortion, as several mostly Republican southern states pass local regulations that drastically cut back access to the procedure.\nConservatives are newly emboldened to try to reverse 1973's Roe v Wade landmark Supreme Court decision, which legalised abortion across the US, after Mr Trump appointed judges who have tilted the court in conservatives' favour.\nSome Democrats have called for Congress to end the so-called Hyde Amendment, a federal provision that says funds cannot go to abortion programmes in US states except in cases of rape and incest. Republicans have vowed to block spending legislation that does not include it.\nMr Biden had long supported the Hyde Amendment as a senator and vice-president, but withdrew support during the 2019 Democratic primary elections.\nWhat's happening with Obamacare?\nMr Biden on Thursday signed an order to reopen the Affordable Care Act - also known as Obamacare - federal insurance marketplace for three months.\nUnder Mr Trump, the enrolment period lasted just six weeks, as the Republican administration sought to dismantle the programme.\nMr Biden said that with the ongoing \"Covid crisis\", now was the time to reinstate access to healthcare and affordable programmes.\nDemocratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi praised the expansion in a weekly briefing, saying: \"We're very excited about that because we're of course in the middle of a pandemic and we see this was a matter of life and death.\"",

        "title": "Biden's Budget Removes A Longstanding Ban On Abortion Funding : NPR",
        "date": "2021-05-31T13:36:55",
        "content": "President Biden's budget proposal fulfills a campaign promise to remove a longstanding ban on federal funding for most abortions known as the Hyde Amendment.\nThe budget plan, released late last week, would drop the policy which has restricted funding for abortion through federal programs such as Medicaid. The rule, in effect since 1980, includes exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or to save a pregnant woman's life.\nBiden has been under pressure from progressive Democrats to reverse Hyde, which reproductive rights groups say disproportionately harms low-income women and people of color.\nA longstanding compromise\nAbortion rights advocates have praised the move; a statement from Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson called the Hyde Amendment \"racist, sexist, deeply unjust\" and thanked Biden for working to remove it.\nAbortion rights opponents, meanwhile, argue that taxpayers with moral objections to abortion should not be compelled to help pay for it.\nIn a statement, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion rights group the Susan B. Anthony List called Hyde a \"common-ground...principle,\" and urged members of Congress to work to include it.\nBiden, a lifelong Catholic, supported Hyde for decades  as did many other Democrats, often as a compromise position with Republicans. It often has been a sticking point in negotiations over healthcare policy, including the debate surrounding the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation.\nThe Biden budget proposal is far from the last word on the matter; Republicans are expected to work to reinstate the Hyde language during budget negotiations. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy released a statement criticizing Biden's budget, saying it \"breaks with decades of settled precedent by calling for direct taxpayer-funded abortion.\"\nAmong Democrats, a turning tide\nDuring the lead-up to the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Biden reversed his longtime position on Hyde, joining other Democratic hopefuls in saying he would work to overturn it.\n\"If I believe heath care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's zip code,\" Biden said in June 2019.\nBiden said his position had changed in response to changing circumstances, including increasing efforts by Republican lawmakers to restrict abortion.\n\"It was not under attack,\" Biden said. \"As it is now.\"\nLater that month, in a forum on abortion rights hosted by Planned Parenthood in South Carolina, Biden explained his reversal, saying he'd supported Hyde in an effort to expand federally-funded healthcare. But he suggested that for low-income women who rely on federal programs, Hyde had become an obstacle to full healthcare access.\n\"It became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here to make sure women still had access, you can't have access if, in fact, everyone's covered by a federal policy,\" he said.\nPromising to reverse multiple Trump-era abortion restrictions, Biden ultimately marshaled the support of Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups, who put the weight of their campaign operation behind him in his fight against Trump in 2020.\nUndoing Trump-era abortion restrictions\nSince taking office, Biden has taken steps toward providing federal funding for abortions for low-income people. Like other Democratic Presidents before him, Biden announced plans soon after taking office to reverse the Mexico City Policy, or what critics describe as the \"Global Gag Rule.\" It forbids international aid groups who receive U.S. funding from providing or referring patients for abortion.\nThe administration is in the process of undoing a similar policy for domestic family planning groups who received funding through the Title X program. New rules implemented under President Trump prompted hundreds of providers to leave that program, including Planned Parenthood.\nAbortion rights groups are asking the administration to take additional steps, including reversing the Helms Amendment, which also restricts the use of U.S. dollars in paying for abortions abroad.\nState and federal battles continue\nAt the same time, Republican state lawmakers have continued a nationwide push to limit abortion, introducing hundreds of restrictions this year alone. Anti-abortion rights groups hope one of those laws will invite the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973.",

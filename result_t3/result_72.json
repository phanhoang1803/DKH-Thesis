        "date": "2024-02-28T17:08:00",
        "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments the week of April 22 in a high-stakes dispute over whether former President Donald Trump enjoys immunity from federal criminal prosecution.\nThe order from the court on Wednesday keeps Trump's prosecution in the Jan. 6 case on hold for at least a few more months.\nThe justices said, in an unsigned order, that their review would be limited to a single question: \"Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\"\nThe issue is one of first impression for the Supreme Court, since no former president has ever faced criminal charges.\nThe decision amounts to, at minimum, another short-term victory for Trump, and it means the trial originally set to begin in Washington, D.C., in early March could be delayed until late summer or even after Election Day in November.\nTrump, the Republican front-runner in this year's presidential election, has argued that the case amounts to election interference and that going to trial this year would burden his ability to run a political campaign. His attorneys said it would be a challenge to sift through the heavy volume of documents in this case.\nTrump is fighting 91 criminal charges in four jurisdictions. The charges are related to his effort to cling to power after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden and other alleged misdeeds that involve retention of classified documents and hush money payments to an adult film actress.\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith had urged the Supreme Court to swiftly reject Trump's claims, arguing the charged crimes \"strike at the heart of our democracy.\"\n\"Delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict  a compelling interest in every criminal case and one that has unique national importance here, as it involves federal criminal charges against a former President for alleged criminal efforts to overturn the results of the Presidential election, including through the use of official power,\" Smith and his team wrote in a recent filing to the justices.\nThree judges on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., unanimously sided with prosecutors this month.\n\"We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter,\" the U.S. circuit judges wrote. Doing so, they said, \"would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three branches.\"\nThe panel said that Trump's immunity argument has virtually no limit. Indeed, at oral argument, when Trump's lawyer was pressed by the panel, he conceded that a president could order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate his political rivals and still be free from any criminal prosecution.\nIn their appeal to the Supreme Court, Trump's lawyers contended, \"Such hypotheticals provide fodder for histrionic media coverage, but they are a poor substitute for legal and historical analysis.\" They called the appellate court's decision a \"stunning breach of precedent and historical norms.\" And they noted that no prior president has ever been prosecuted for his official acts.\nPresident Richard Nixon was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate scandal, which saw many of his highest-ranking aides go to prison. But after Nixon resigned, he was pardoned by President Gerald Ford.\nSo the question of presidential immunity has never been resolved by the Supreme Court. In 1974, the justices ruled unanimously that Nixon, then still in office, had to comply with a subpoena for 64 White House tape recordings that were subsequently used as evidence in the prosecution of many top administration officials. The Nixon tapes case thus became the leading precedent suggesting that presidents do not have complete immunity for acts they commit while in office.\nThe contrary precedent, cited by Trump's lawyers, is a civil case that was decided eight years later and that also involved Nixon. In that case, the court ruled 5-4 that the former president could not be sued by an Air Force whistleblower who claimed he was fired in retaliation for his disclosures about cost overruns.\nThe consequences of Wednesday's Supreme Court action remain murky at best. A judge in New York already has ordered jury selection to begin March 25 in a separate state case accusing Trump of recordkeeping violations for hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election.\nThe judge in the federal election interference case, Tanya Chutkan, has not yet indicated when a trial in D.C. could begin. But in court papers, she has suggested she will give Trump's attorneys a few more months to prepare.\nAll that can be said with certainty now is that the clock is ticking. If Trump regains the White House, he could order his Justice Department to drop the case related to the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the Capitol or could even attempt to pardon himself.\nThe immunity issue is far from the only question involving Trump to reach the nation's highest court. The justices have yet to decide a separate dispute about whether Trump is disqualified from the primary ballot in Colorado over his efforts to cling to power after he lost the 2020 election to Biden.\nAnd they've scheduled arguments in another case related to the Capitol riot for April 16. In that case, they'll consider whether prosecutors overreached when they used an obstruction law that Congress passed after financial scandals to charge hundreds of people with disrupting the electoral count.\nTwo of the four charges against Trump in the federal prosecution could be wiped away if a majority of the Supreme Court judges determine that the Justice Department's charging strategy went too far.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a lawsuit backed by President Donald Trump to overturn Joe Bidens election victory, ending a desperate attempt to get legal issues rejected by state and federal judges before the nations highest court and subvert the will of voters.\nTrump bemoaned the decision late Friday, tweeting: The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage!\nThe high courts order was a stark repudiation of a legal claim that was widely regarded as dubious, yet embraced by the president, 19 Republican state attorneys general and 126 House Republicans.\nTrump had insisted the court would find the wisdom and courage to adopt his baseless position that the election was the product of widespread fraud and should be overturned. But the nations highest court emphatically disagreed.\nFridays order marked the second time this week that the court had rebuffed Republican requests that it get involved in the 2020 election outcome and reject the voters choice, as expressed in an election regarded by both Republican and Democratic officials as free and fair. The justices turned away an appeal from Pennsylvania Republicans on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, the Electoral College meets to formally elect Biden as the next president.\nTrump had called the lawsuit filed by Texas against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin the big one that would end with the Supreme Court undoing Bidens substantial Electoral College majority and allowing Trump to serve another four years in the White House.\nIn a brief order, the court said Texas does not have the legal right to sue those states because it has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who have said previously the court does not have the authority to turn away lawsuits between states, said they would have heard Texas complaint. But they would not have done as Texas wanted  setting aside those four states 62 electoral votes for Biden  pending resolution of the lawsuit.\nTrump complained that within a flash, the lawsuit was thrown out and gone, without even looking at the many reasons it was brought. A Rigged Election, fight on!\nThree Trump appointees sit on the high court. In his push to get the most recent of his nominees, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, confirmed quickly, Trump said she would be needed for any post-election lawsuits. Barrett appears to have participated in both cases this week. None of the Trump appointees noted a dissent in either case.\nThe four states sued by Texas had urged the court to reject the case as meritless. They were backed by another 22 states and the District of Columbia.\nRepublican support for the lawsuit and its call to throw out millions of votes in four battleground states was rooted in baseless claims of fraud, an extraordinary display of the partys willingness to countermand the will of voters. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana were among those joining to support the action.\nThe Court has rightly dismissed out of hand the extreme, unlawful and undemocratic GOP lawsuit to overturn the will of millions of American voters, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday night.\nA few Republicans expressed concerns about the case. Many others remained silent even as Trump endlessly repeated claims that he lost a chance at a second term due to widespread fraud.\nSen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who has previously criticized the president, applauded the courts decision.\nSince Election Night, a lot of people have been confusing voters by spinning Kenyan Birther-type, Chavez rigged the election from the grave conspiracy theories, but every American who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the Supreme Court  including all three of President Trumps picks  closed the book on the nonsense, Sasse said in a statement.\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the court saw through this seditious abuse of the judicial process.\nWhile these stunts are legally insignificant, their cost to our country  in misleading the public about a free and fair election and in tearing at our Constitution  is high and we will not tolerate them from our sister states or anyone else, said Shapiro, a Democrat.\nThe Texas complaint repeated false, disproven and unsubstantiated accusations about the voting in four states that went for Trumps Democratic challenger. The high court had never before been asked for such a dramatic remedy.\nTwo days after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed his suit, Trump jumped into the high court case. Hours later, the president held a meeting at the White House, scheduled before the suit was filed, with a dozen Republican attorneys general, including Paxton and several others who backed the effort.\nIf the Supreme Court shows great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history, and our Electoral Process will be respected again! he tweeted Friday afternoon. Trump had spent the week relentlessly tweeting about the Texas case with the hashtag overturn and claiming, falsely, that he had won the election but was robbed.\nIn a statement Friday, Paxton called the Supreme Courts decision unfortunate.\nStill, some of the top state Republican prosecutors who urged the court to get involved acknowledged that the effort was a long shot and sought to distance themselves from Trumps baseless allegations of fraud.\nThe case inflamed already high tensions over the election. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said his office staff received two death threats Thursday after he signed onto the brief supporting the case.\nThe lawsuit also divided officials in some states.\nMontana Attorney General Tim Fox supported Texas case, even though he said the suit was belated and its chances are slim at best. Fox said the case raised important constitutional questions about the separation of powers and the integrity of mail-in ballots in those defendant states.\nBut Gov. Steve Bullock, D-Mont., urged the court to reject the case. He said the fact that Texas is not suing Montana, which Trump won, even though the state similarly used mail-in ballots underscores that this action is less about election integrity than it is about attempting to overturn the will of the electorate.\nTrumps repetition of election-related falsehoods and conspiracy theories has taken hold among far-right media and much of his base. Many Republican voters in several states won by Biden have demanded that their elected officials find a way to invalidate the president-elects victories.\nThe Republican Party of Texas on Friday evening issued a statement raising the far-fetched possibility of secession. Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the constitution, said party chairman Allen West, the former Florida congressman.\nEven though the courts action seemed to be the end of the road for Trumps legal fights about the 2020 election results, the presidents efforts may have a destabilizing effect long after he leaves office. Trumps personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, vowed Friday to keep fighting.\nSome litigation may continue, but it will not change election results, said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the Universtiy of California, Irvine. The delegitimization of the Biden presidency by Trump, and of elections generally, will reverberate for years to come. And thats a real tragedy.\n____\nMerchant reported from Houston and Richer reported from Boston.

        "content": "HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP)  A Texas man who admitted he kidnapped, sexually assaulted and fatally shot an 18-year-old woman in 2001 was executed Wednesday evening.\nRamiro Gonzales, 41, was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. following a chemical injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville for the January 2001 killing of Bridget Townsend.\nGonzales was repeatedly apologetic to the victims relatives in his last statement from the execution chamber.\nI cant put into words the pain I have caused yall, the hurt, what I took away that I cannot give back. I hope this apology is enough, he said.\nI never stopped praying that you would forgive me and that one day I would have this opportunity to apologize. I owe all of you my life and I hope one day you will forgive me, he added, just before the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital began flowing.\nAs the drug took effect, he took seven breaths, then began sounds like snores. Within less than a minute, all movement had stopped.\nGonzales kidnapped Townsend, who would have turned 41 on Wednesday, from a rural home in Bandera County, northwest of San Antonio. He later took her to his familys ranch in neighboring Medina County, where he sexually assaulted her before killing her. Her body wasnt found until October 2002, when Gonzales led authorities to her remains in southwest Texas after he had received two life sentences for kidnapping and raping another woman.\nWe have finally witnessed justice be being served, Townsends brother, David, said after watching the execution. This day marks the end of a long and painful journey for our family. For over two decades we have endured unimaginable pain and heartache.\nHe said Gonzales death provides us a little bit of peace. I do want to say we are not joyous. We are not happy. This is a very, very sad day for everyone all the way around.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined a defense plea to intervene about 1 and 1/2 hours before the executions scheduled start time. The high court rejected arguments by Gonzales lawyers that he had taken responsibility for what he did and that a prosecution expert witness now says he was wrong in testifying that Gonzales would be a future danger to society, a legal finding needed to impose a death sentence.\nHe has earnestly devoted himself to self-improvement, contemplation, and prayer, and has grown into a mature, peaceful, kind, loving, and deeply religious adult. He acknowledges his responsibility for his crimes and has sought to atone for them and to seek redemption through his actions, Gonzales lawyers had written Monday in their unsuccessful request to the Supreme Court for a stay of execution. After re-evaluating Gonzales in 2022, Gripon said his prediction was wrong.\nEarlier this month, a group of 11 evangelical leaders from Texas and around the country asked the parole board and Gov. Greg Abbott to halt the execution and grant clemency. They had said Gonzalez was helping other death row inmates through a faith-based program.\nIn video submitted as part of his clemency request to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, Gonzales admitted responsibility.\nI just want (Townsends mother) to know how sorry I really am. I took everything that was valuable from a mother, said Gonzales, who was 18 years old at the time. So, every day its a continual task to do everything that I can to feel that responsibility for the life that I took.\nOn Monday, the parole board voted 7-0 against commuting Gonzales death sentence to a lesser penalty. Members also rejected granting him a six-month reprieve.\nProsecutors described Gonzales as a sexual predator who told police he ignored Townsends pleas to spare her life. They argued that jurors reached the right decision on a death sentence because he had a long criminal history and showed no remorse.\nThe States punishment case was overwhelming, the Texas Attorney Generals Office said. Even if Dr. Gripons testimony were wiped from the punishment slate, it would not have mattered.\nGonzales execution was the second this year in Texas and the eighth in the U.S. On Thursday, Oklahoma is scheduled to execute Richard Rojem for the 1984 abduction, rape and killing of a 7-year-old girl.\n___\nLozano reported from Houston.\n___",

There is no mention of San Felix, Venezuela, or any medical clinic in the provided text. The evidence focuses entirely on a criminal case in Texas. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate and completely out of context with the given source.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on the named entities. However, the external evidence strongly refutes the caption, indicating it is completely unrelated to the source material. The external source details an execution in Texas, unrelated to a clinic in San Felix, Venezuela. Therefore, the caption is out of context, and the lower confidence score reflects the discrepancy between internal and external findings.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation supports the caption, while external validation strongly contradicts it. The external evidence is about a Texas execution, completely different from the image content and the caption's claim about a Venezuelan clinic."

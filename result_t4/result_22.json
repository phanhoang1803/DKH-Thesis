        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

      "explanation": "The provided evidence from Snopes explicitly refutes the news caption.  The video depicts protesters in Hong Kong dismantling a smart lamppost in August 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.  Snopes confirms the video's authenticity but states it is unrelated to 5G towers or the coronavirus.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes fact-check explicitly states that the video shows protesters in Hong Kong tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in August 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. This directly contradicts the claim in the news caption.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original news caption is out of context.  The internal check reveals several inconsistencies: the video shows destruction of structures claimed to be 5G towers, but comments dispute this, identifying them as facial recognition towers; the location is identified as Hong Kong, not China; and there's no mention of COVID-19. The external check provides compelling evidence from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, confirming that the video depicts a 2019 protest in Hong Kong, predating the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the destroyed structures were smart lampposts, not 5G towers.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check further strengthens this conclusion. There is no disagreement between the internal and external checks; both concur that the news caption is misleading and inaccurate. The video's context is entirely different from what the original caption suggests. The visual evidence itself does not definitively show 5G towers; the structures are ambiguous enough to allow for multiple interpretations.  This ambiguity is resolved by the external fact-check which provides verifiable information about the video's origin and context.  No evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization was found, which means the visual evidence supports the external check's findings.  Therefore, based on the combined evidence from visual analysis, internal consistency checks, and robust external verification, it can be confidently concluded that the news caption is significantly out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation decisively refute the original news caption.  Internal inconsistencies and an external fact-check from Snopes clearly show the video depicts a 2019 protest in Hong Kong, unrelated to 5G towers or the COVID-19 pandemic."

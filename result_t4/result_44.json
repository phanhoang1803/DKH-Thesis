        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

    "explanation": "The internal check analyzes the image and caption for consistency, finding that the image depicts the Annabelle doll, and the caption mentions the doll's connection to the Warren's Occult Museum. This internal analysis gives a high confidence score because the image clearly shows the Annabelle doll, and the caption is factually consistent with its association with the Warrens' museum. However, the external check uses Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, to evaluate the claim that the Annabelle doll escaped from the museum. Snopes' investigation reveals this claim to be false, based on statements by Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law.  Spera explicitly denies the escape, stating that the doll remains in the museum. The high confidence score from Snopes, combined with Spera's statement, strongly suggests that the original caption is incorrect. The discrepancy between the high internal confidence and the high external confidence score stems from a difference in the focus of each check. The internal check focuses on the visual and textual consistency within the provided image and caption.  The external check broadens the scope to include external verifiable sources, ultimately revealing a factual inaccuracy in the original caption.  Therefore, considering the evidence from both checks, we conclude that the original caption, stating that the Annabelle doll escaped from the museum, is out of context because it presents inaccurate information. The visual evidence supports the identification of the doll, but does not support the claim of escape, a claim debunked by reliable external sources.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds visual and textual consistency, but external check (Snopes) reveals the caption's claim of the doll's escape to be false.  The final verdict is that the caption is out of context due to factual inaccuracy."

    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy because the image clearly depicts Grace Coolidge with a raccoon in what seems to be a public event with many onlookers, consistent with a White House Easter Egg Roll. However, the external validation check expresses low confidence (score 5), citing the lack of corroborating evidence from external sources. There is no mention of this specific event (date, First Lady, egg-rolling) in the sources cited. Although the external source mentions that presidents and first ladies have been photographed with raccoons at the White House, this is not specific enough to confirm the caption's claims.  The discrepancy between the internal and external checks arises from the challenge of definitively verifying historical events from an image alone.  While the image is internally consistent with the caption's description, the lack of external corroboration leaves a considerable uncertainty. The visual evidence strongly supports the presence of Grace Coolidge and a raccoon at an outdoor gathering, but it cannot independently verify the date or the specific event being the annual White House egg-rolling event.  There is no visual evidence of Easter eggs or other activities directly associated with an Easter egg roll.  Therefore, despite the strong internal visual consistency, the absence of solid external verification makes it unreliable to confidently claim that the image depicts the exact scene described in the caption. The low confidence score reflects the limitations of validating historical events solely based on a photograph and the absence of robust external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption based on visual evidence, showing Grace Coolidge with a raccoon at an outdoor event. External validation, however, finds insufficient corroborating evidence to confirm the specific event as the 1927 White House Easter Egg Roll, leading to a disagreement and a low overall confidence score. The lack of external verification regarding the date and event outweighs the strong internal consistency."

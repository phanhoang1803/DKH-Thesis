        "date": "2020-05-19T08:43:46",
        "content": "Claim:\nEnvironmental activist Greta Thunberg urged China to ban the use of chopsticks.\nSwedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has been the subject of a number of baseless rumors ever since the then-15-year-old stepped into the spotlight in 2018. We've previously examined false accusations that Thunberg was the \"highest paid activist,\" that she was actually an actress, and that she was once filmed firing a machine gun.\nThunberg did not ask China to \"give up\" chopsticks.\nThis rumor has been circulating since at least January 2020. Although it has taken several forms, we've yet to encounter any social media posts pointing to when or where Thunberg allegedly made this request.\nOne of the earliest postings of this rumor, which was shared by the unverified Twitter account @Geoloong on Jan. 14, included a GIF of Thunberg speaking at the Climate Action Summit in 2019, but Thunberg made no mention of \"chopsticks\" during this speech. We searched other articles, interviews, and speeches delivered by Thunberg around this time and found no record of her asking China to ban chopsticks.\nOther red flags in this post indicate the rumor is little more than an invented anecdote to mock the teenager. For starters, we found that this story was being shared almost exclusively by people expressing a negative view of Thunberg. If this was a genuine quote, you'd expect this story would have been shared (at least initially) by Thunberg's supporters.\nFurthermore, the anecdote described in this post is simply ludicrous. Although it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for Thunberg, a teenager who became Time magazine's youngest Person of the Year for her work addressing climate change, to note the adverse environmental impact of disposable chopsticks, it would be quite extraordinary for the government of the most populous country in the world to issue a juvenile response telling someone not to \"wipe their butt\" because toilet paper is made from trees.\nIf China did issue such a statement, it would have surely been international news. Yet, just as we were unable to find a source for Thunberg's alleged comment, we were unable to find a credible source for China's alleged insult. In fact, the text on the above-displayed meme is a near-verbatim copy of the text published to the humor website Joe.ks.com.\nAlthough Thunberg did not urge China to ban the use of chopsticks, China truly uses millions of trees every year to produce billions of pairs of disposable chopsticks. When concerns about the adverse impact disposable chopsticks had on the environment were raised in 2006, the Chinese government implemented a 5% tax on the utensil in an attempt to slow deforestation.\nBBC News reported:\nThe Chinese government is introducing a 5% tax on disposable wooden chopsticks in a bid to preserve its forests.\nIt produces about 45 billion pairs of chopsticks a year, consuming millions of trees and bamboo plants.\nThe move came as China said it would raise some consumption taxes next month in a bid to help the environment and narrow the gap between rich and poor.",

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the presence of Greta Thunberg and the mention of China in both the image and caption. It correctly identifies Greta Thunberg in the image but notes the absence of any information regarding chopsticks. The internal check's verdict is true, solely because the caption's mention of Greta Thunberg aligns with the image. However, this overlooks the crucial factual inaccuracy regarding the chopsticks claim.\n\nThe external check, using Snopes.com as a source, decisively refutes the caption's core claim. It finds no evidence to support Greta Thunberg urging China to ban chopsticks. This external validation is critical as it assesses the factual accuracy, which the internal check failed to address. The external check provides strong evidence that the claim is false, and is supported by a reputable fact-checking website.\n\nThe discrepancy lies in the scope of validation: the internal check only performs a textual comparison, while the external check investigates the factual accuracy of the claim.  The external check has a much higher confidence score (10) because it provides evidence-based verification from a reliable source. The internal check, while not wrong in identifying the subject, lacks the scope to determine the truthfulness of the claim about chopsticks. Therefore, the external check's findings are much more influential in determining the overall accuracy.\n\nThe image shows only Greta Thunberg; there is no visual element showing chopsticks or any context related to a ban on chopsticks in China. Therefore, the caption is out of context, and the visual element doesn't support the claim made. There is no evidence of image manipulation or misrepresentation of visual details. The visual element only shows the individual, and it is consistent with the caption's partial truth about Greta Thunberg's presence.  However, it is completely unrelated to the false information about chopsticks.\n\nCombining the internal and external checks, we can confidently conclude that the caption is inaccurate and out of context because the core claim—that Greta Thunberg urged a ban on chopsticks in China—is false. The image only provides a picture of Greta Thunberg and does not support the statement about the chopsticks. The external validation from Snopes decisively refutes the central claim, overriding the limited scope of the internal check.  Thus, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context and the confidence score is high (10) due to the strong external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms Greta Thunberg's presence, but doesn't validate the claim about chopsticks. External check (Snopes) strongly refutes the chopsticks claim.  The caption is out of context because the central claim is false and unsupported by visual evidence."

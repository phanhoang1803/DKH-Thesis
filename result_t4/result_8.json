        "content": "Claim:\nA Colorado hunter claimed he was sexually assaulted by a Sasquatch.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn May 2017, people on social media got wind of an article about a Colorado hunter who apparently claimed that a Sasquatch (a creature of legend also known as Bigfoot or, in some circles, the Yeti) sexually assaulted him:\nThe article was published by World News Daily Report on 11 May 2017:\nThe 57-year old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday, to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter.\nAll of a sudden, a large gorilla-like creature dropped from a tree in front of him punched him in the face ... While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.\nWhen I regained consciousness, he had already torn my pants and was tearing through my underwear. I stabbed him in the shoulder with my hunting knife, and that made him run away.\nThe item included a photograph of large footprints, purportedly captured at the scene of the incident. That image dated back to at least 2011, and was unrelated to any incidents involving a hunter versus Bigfoot encounter in 2017.\nHowever, all of this is beside the point, because there is no truth to this story; World News Daily Report admits on its own disclaimer page that all of its site content is fictional:\nWNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website  even those based on real people  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.",

Snopes clearly states the story is false and that the website publishing it admits to publishing fictional content.  Therefore, while the caption accurately describes the original false claim, it's important to note that the claim itself is untrue.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 (Snopes):  The Snopes article directly addresses the claim in the news caption. It quotes the original claim: \"A Colorado hunter claimed he was sexually assaulted by a Sasquatch.\"  It then definitively states that this claim is \"False\" and cites the source's own admission that its content is fictional.",

    "explanation": "The image shows a person in a white, furry costume resembling a Yeti in a snowy forest. The original news caption claims that a Colorado hunter reported a sexual assault by a Sasquatch (also known as Bigfoot or Yeti).  The internal check correctly identifies the mismatch: the image contains no evidence of assault, a Colorado setting, or a hunter.  Its confidence score of 0 reflects this lack of visual correlation.  The external check, however, reveals that the news caption, while factually incorrect, accurately reflects an initial, false claim made by a news website known for publishing fictional content.  Snopes debunked this claim.  The external check's high confidence score (10) emphasizes the factual inaccuracy of the underlying claim despite the caption's accurate reflection of the original, false report. The discrepancy arises from the difference between the caption's accuracy in reflecting a published (though false) claim and the caption's complete lack of visual support in the provided image.  In essence, the caption is technically accurate in representing a made-up news story, but completely unrelated to the image.  Therefore,  the caption is out of context considering the image; while the caption accurately reflects a false news story, the image depicts nothing related to the story.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong external evidence confirming the falsity of the underlying claim, outweighing the internal check's lower confidence score.  Both checks, when combined, strongly suggest the caption is out of context with respect to the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds no visual evidence to support the caption's claim; external check confirms that the claim itself is false, originating from a fictional news source. Despite the caption accurately reflecting a published (but false) report, it's completely out of context with the image."

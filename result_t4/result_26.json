Hodas posted the video to Instagram (with tags such as #3D, #photoshop, #render, and #animation), and provided extra insight into how the video was created in response to a query on Facebook:\npretty much! depends on what I need. In this case I layered few planes with wm maps on top of each other and added a lot of zdepth fog to blend it in.\nNo records of volcanos emitting bright pink smoke exist, except those created by digital artists.",

Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, rates the claim as false.  Their investigation reveals that the video depicting a pink volcano eruption is digitally manipulated artwork by Filip Hodas, not an actual event.  No evidence supports the existence of a naturally occurring pink volcano eruption in New Zealand.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The claim that the image depicts an actual \"pink volcano\" erupting in New Zealand is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check correctly identifies that the image shows a pink and purple smoke cloud, not a volcanic eruption, and finds no evidence supporting the New Zealand location.  This aligns perfectly with the external check, which leverages a fact-check from Snopes.com. Snopes definitively states that the image (or a video version) is digitally manipulated artwork by Filip Hodas, refuting its depiction of a real volcanic event.  The external check provides strong supporting evidence by highlighting Snopes's verification process and the absence of any credible records of naturally occurring pink volcanic eruptions.  The visual evidence in the image further supports this conclusion. The pink and purple smoke plume exhibits characteristics more consistent with colored smoke bombs or digitally enhanced imagery than a natural geological event. The relatively uniform and smooth texture of the cloud, as well as its visually striking, artificial color, are inconsistencies with the chaotic and less uniformly colored nature of actual volcanic eruptions.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong agreement between the internal analysis of the image and the external verification from a trusted source like Snopes, making the claim demonstrably false and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly agree that the caption is false.  The image does not depict a volcanic eruption, but rather a digitally manipulated image or a colored smoke plume.  External verification from Snopes.com provides definitive proof that the image is not a real event in New Zealand."

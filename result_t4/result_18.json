        "content": "Claim:\nThe Missouri state government issued \"[N-word] hunting\" licenses.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2014, photos of a \"[N-word] hunting\" license circulated on social media sites, often accompanied by a message claiming the license had been issued by the state of Missouri:\nThe pictured license was not issued by the state of Missouri, nor did it provide the holder the legal right to hunt and kill African-Americans. It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

      "explanation": "The claim that photos of a \"nigger hunting\" license had been issued by the state of Missouri is FALSE.  Snopes.com investigated this claim and found that while such racist memorabilia did exist and circulated online, they were not issued by the state of Missouri. The licenses shown in photos were part of racist memorabilia, not official documents.  While there were reports of such items being sold at an event involving law enforcement officers, investigations found no evidence that they were widely available or issued by the state.",

They were racist memorabilia, possibly from the 1920s, and circulated on social media.

    "explanation": "The internal validation check, based solely on the image content, correctly identifies the presence of the text \"STATE OF MISSOURI\" and \"NIGGER HUNTING LICENSE\" within the image.  This gives a high confidence score of 10 internally. However, the external validation provides crucial contextual information that significantly alters the interpretation. The external check, using Snopes as a reliable source, reveals that the license is not an official document issued by the state of Missouri. Instead, the items are identified as racist memorabilia, possibly from the 1920s, that has been circulated online. The external check's lower confidence score of 8 reflects the complexity in definitively tracing the origin and distribution of such items and the possibility of misinformation. The discrepancy arises from the conflict between the literal visual content (internal check) and the historical/factual context (external check). The image alone shows a document that appears to be an official license but lacks context about its authenticity. External validation provides the missing context, demonstrating that the caption's implication of official state issuance is false. The caption is misleading, despite the accurate portrayal of the image's visual content.  The final confidence score considers both aspects and leans toward the external validation due to its more comprehensive analysis and reliance on a verified source like Snopes. While the image itself shows the text mentioned in the caption, the caption's implication of official state sanction is incorrect. Therefore, the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the presence of text matching the caption, but external validation reveals the image depicts racist memorabilia, not an official Missouri document.  The caption is misleading due to lack of proper contextual information and is therefore out of context."

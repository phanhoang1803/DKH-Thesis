    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The image depicts a woman, possibly Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, holding a lit candle. This aligns with the caption's description of the Meskel festival, which celebrates the discovery of the True Cross.  The internal check highlights the contextual relevance of the image to the caption, acknowledging the absence of explicit depiction of Jesus but noting the significance of the cross within the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian faith. The external check strongly supports the caption's accuracy, citing sources that confirm the festival's meaning as the commemoration of the finding of the cross upon which Jesus was crucified. The high confidence scores from both internal (8) and external (10) checks, combined with the visual consistency of the image with the described religious context, support the conclusion that the caption is not out of context. While the image doesn't explicitly show the cross or any direct representation of the crucifixion, the woman's attire and the act of holding a lit candle during what seems to be a nighttime religious observance strongly suggest a connection to the Meskel festival. The external validation provides direct textual evidence corroborating the caption's claim about the festival's significance, further solidifying the accuracy of the caption. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both agree on the contextual relevance and accuracy of the caption, though the internal check acknowledges the indirect visual representation of the event.  The image does not appear to be tampered with or miscontextualized; it appears to be an authentic depiction of a religious observance.  The overall assessment suggests a high degree of confidence in the accuracy and contextual appropriateness of the caption. Considering the visual evidence, the internal consistency, and the strong external validation, the conclusion is that the caption is not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The image's visual elements and context align well with the description of the Meskel festival.  External sources directly confirm the festival's significance as the celebration of the discovery of the True Cross."

Balmedie beach in Scotland is a real place, and while horses on the beach aren't unusual, it's not a guaranteed occurrence. The caption itself is grammatically correct and reads naturally. However, without further context or verification, it's impossible to confirm definitively whether this specific event took place. ",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the authenticity of the caption. The internal check highlights the visual alignment of the image with the caption's description: a girl (possibly Rosie) watching horses on a beach, which appears consistent with Balmedie beach.  The absence of Ruaraidh McMahon's name in the image is not contradictory; captions often omit such details. The external check verifies the existence of Balmedie beach and the plausibility of horses being present, acknowledging that it's not an everyday occurrence but neither is it impossible. Both checks express some degree of uncertainty due to the lack of definitive proof of the specific event described. The external check correctly points out that while the caption itself is grammatically sound and believable, confirming the exact event depicted without further information remains challenging. This uncertainty accounts for a slight reduction in the overall confidence score.  There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The image is consistent with what one might reasonably expect if a child observed horses on a beach.  The internal check's higher confidence score stems from its direct focus on the visual aspects of the image and its match with textual details, while the external check necessarily considers broader factors and potential unknowns. While the external check acknowledges the caption's plausibility, it correctly refrains from definitively confirming the event's occurrence. Combining the internal and external assessment, and given the lack of concrete contradictory evidence, it is more likely that the caption aligns with the image than not.  However, the degree of certainty isn't absolute, hence the moderate confidence score.  The minor discrepancies are not severe enough to label the caption as out-of-context. The overall assessment favors the likelihood of a genuine caption accurately representing the photograph.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible, with the internal check having slightly higher confidence due to the direct visual-textual match.  Uncertainty remains due to the absence of definitive verification for the specific event. No evidence of tampering or misrepresentation is found."

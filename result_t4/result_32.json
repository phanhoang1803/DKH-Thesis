The photo, which was taken of Trump with his parents in 1992, has been altered.\nTHE FACTS: The manipulated photo, edited to make it appear Trumps parents are wearing Klan garb, has circulated before on social media. It surfaced again this week on Facebook and Twitter.\nThe original photo was taken by Judie Burstein in 1992, according to Globe Photos, a celebrity and entertainment photo company that archived the image in March 2004.\nThe image shows Trump in a red tie and a black suit standing with his arms wrapped around his mother and father. Mary Trump is wearing a pink and black floral suit, with pearls draped around her neck. Fred Trump is wearing a navy suit, red pocket square and polka dot tie. The three Trumps posed for the photo against a marble wall backdrop and a sign that reads theater tickets.\nTrump followed his father into the real estate business. Fred Trump, who made a fortune in real estate, died in 1999 at the age of 93. Mary Trump died in 2000, at the age of 88.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

    "explanation": "The original news caption claims that the image shows Donald Trump posing with his parents in Ku Klux Klan robes.  Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal analysis reveals a significant discrepancy between the caption and the visual content. While the image does show Donald Trump with his mother and another man in robes, there is no visual evidence to definitively identify those robes as Ku Klux Klan regalia.  The robes have some symbols, but nothing clearly and unequivocally links them to the KKK. The internal analysis correctly flags the caption's assertion as inaccurate due to lack of visual evidence supporting the KKK claim.  The confidence score of 3 reflects this uncertainty stemming from the ambiguity of the symbols on the robes.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation provides compelling evidence that the caption is false. Multiple reliable sources (AP News, Snopes, Politifact) corroborate that the image circulating online is a digitally altered version of an original photograph. These sources explicitly state that the image has been manipulated to falsely depict Trump's parents wearing KKK robes.  The original photograph shows Trump and his parents in regular clothing, devoid of any KKK attire. This robust external evidence completely undermines the caption's claim and establishes its falsity with high confidence. The confidence score of 10 reflects the strong consensus among reliable sources.\n\nDiscrepancies and Uncertainties:\nThere is a discrepancy in confidence scores between the internal (3) and external (10) validation.  The internal analysis was limited to the visual evidence within the image itself, leading to a lower confidence score due to the ambiguity of the symbols.  The external analysis, however, leverages broader contextual information from multiple authoritative sources, thus achieving a much higher confidence score by establishing the image's authenticity and the caption's falsehood. The visual ambiguity internal analysis detected was fully resolved by external evidence which identified the image alteration and original photograph. \n\nConclusion:\nGiven the overwhelming evidence from multiple reliable sources, the original caption is definitively out of context. The manipulation of the original image to falsely associate Trump's parents with the KKK makes the caption entirely false. Combining the internal and external analysis, we confidently conclude that the claim made in the original caption is false.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations concur that the original caption is false.  Internal analysis notes a lack of visual evidence to support the claim of KKK robes, while external verification reveals the image was digitally altered. The external validation findings significantly outweigh the internal ambiguity. The original image has been manipulated to include false elements."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph proves Hillary Clinton wanted someone like Donald Trump to run for office.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2019, a meme circulated on Facebook and Instagram suggesting Hillary Clinton got her wish that someone like Donald Trump would run for office.\nIn the meme, a photograph of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shown above a caption that quotes Clinton as saying, \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyre honest and cant be bought.\nThis was a variation of a familiar claim, which we identified as \"False\" back in 2016 when Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump.\nThe quote is a fabrication inspired by remarks Clinton delivered to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillarys left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, its an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.",

      "explanation": "The claim that Hillary Clinton \"got her wish\" that someone like Donald Trump would run for office is rated as \"Miscaptioned\" by Snopes.  Snopes traces the claim to a meme using a fabricated quote attributed to Clinton.  The quote is not authentic; it's a variation of a claim debunked in 2016. While the image in the meme is real (from the Trump wedding), the caption is false. Therefore, the news caption is not supported by the evidence.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence in the accuracy of the image depicting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. However, the external check, using Snopes, reveals that the claim within the caption – that Hillary Clinton wished for someone like Donald Trump to run for office – is false.  Snopes definitively labels this claim as 'Miscaptioned,' citing a fabricated quote attributed to Clinton.  The meme using this fabricated quote does feature a real image, the one presented here; however, the image is misrepresented by the false claim. This discrepancy between the internal verification of the image itself and the external debunking of the caption's claim is crucial. The image is valid; it shows the two individuals together.  However, the caption connects them in a context unsupported by evidence, specifically a non-existent quote.  The high confidence score from the internal check reflects the accurate representation of the visual elements – Clinton and Trump are indeed pictured. The high confidence score from the external check reflects the robust evidence from Snopes debunking the fabricated quote. Therefore, while the image is accurate, the caption is demonstrably out of context. There is no verifiable evidence suggesting Clinton expressed this wish. The image is genuine, but the caption is misleading. Visual inspection shows no signs of tampering or miscontextualization; the photo itself is legitimate. The internal and external checks are aligned in that the image is valid, but diverge in assessing the caption's truthfulness.  The external check's strong refutation of the caption's claim takes precedence, resulting in a final judgment that the caption is out of context. The confidence score reflects the strong evidence from both internal (image accuracy) and external (caption falsity) checks, leaning towards the external assessment because a false caption renders the overall statement misleading, despite an accurate depiction of individuals within the image. Considering both internal and external validation points, the conclusion is that the caption is out of context, relying on a false claim. Any other outcome would mean ignoring a key piece of verifiable information provided by an established fact-checking organization.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check validates the image's accuracy; external check via Snopes debunks the caption's claim as fabricated.  The caption is out of context despite a genuine image."

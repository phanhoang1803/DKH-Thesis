        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

      "explanation": "The news caption claims that the Annabelle doll escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut.  Snopes.com fact-checks this claim as false.  Their article directly states that the rumor of the doll's escape is false and was likely due to a mistranslation.  Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, also explicitly denied the escape in a YouTube video, confirming the doll remained in the museum.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check focuses on the visual aspect of the image and the caption's direct mention of the Annabelle doll and its association with horror films.  It correctly identifies that the image depicts the Annabelle doll. However, the claim of the doll escaping from a Connecticut museum is not visually supported in the image. The internal check's high confidence score (10) is justified because the image directly depicts the Annabelle doll, a key element of the caption.  The external check, on the other hand, directly contradicts the caption's claim.  It provides strong evidence from reputable sources (Snopes and a statement from Tony Spera) demonstrating that the news of the doll's escape is false. The external check also has a high confidence score (10), grounded in the verifiable fact-check and statement from a relevant individual.  Given the substantial discrepancy between internal (visual) and external (factual) checks, the final assessment concludes that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score (10) reflects the certainty of both checks individually and the clear contradiction between them.  The image itself is not misleading; it accurately depicts the Annabelle doll. The caption's error lies in the assertion of the doll's escape, which is demonstrably false according to reliable external sources.  There is no evidence to suggest visual manipulation or miscontextualization.  The disagreement arises because the image focuses on the visual identification of the doll, while the caption adds a false narrative about the event related to the doll.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the image shows the Annabelle doll but can't verify the escape claim; External check strongly refutes the escape claim as false.  A clear contradiction exists, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

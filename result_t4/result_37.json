        "content": "As nations around the world responded to the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, some social media users started circulating a video that they claimed showed North Korea leader Kim Jong Un blaming U.S. President Joe Biden for the war.\nAn Oct. 12 Instagram post features a video of Kim delivering a speech behind a lectern. Text at the start of the video claims it shows Kims speech about the Israel-Hamas war. He is speaking in Korean, but English captions were added.\n\"Under the Biden administration, conflicts erupt yearly,\" read the English captions as Kim speaks. \"This year a war begins between Israel and Palestine. Last year a war begins between Russia and Ukraine. And two years ago, billions worth of military equipment was left to the Taliban. Im afraid that if the Biden admin. Does not cease to exist in the next election, world war 3 may begin. Who knows what next years war will be. I support Donald Trump for President in 2024. Good Luck to Mr. Trump.\"\nThis post and others were flagged as part of Metas efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We also found this video shared on TikTok.\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nThe English captions do not reflect what Kim said in his address.\nA Google reverse image search revealed that Kim delivered this speech in October 2020, three years before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and more than a year before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\nIn the speech, made on Oct. 10, 2020, at a military parade, Kim warned he would \"fully mobilize\" North Koreas nuclear force if it was threatened, Politico reported. Kim also tearfully thanked his people for overcoming burdens, including the coronavirus pandemic, and apologized for not satisfactorily preventing North Koreans from experiencing hardships, according to The Korea Times, an English-language South Korean newspaper.\nThe BBC shared a clip that matched part of the video posted on Instagram, and reported that Kim said no one could appreciate North Korean troops \"heroic devotion\" without \"shedding tears of gratitude.\"\nThe National Committee on North Korea  a U.S.-based organization that says it supports \"principled engagement\" between the U.S. and North Korea to promote peace on the Korean peninsula  published an English translation of Kims speech produced by the Korean Central News Agency, a North Korean state media outlet.\nPolitiFact cross-referenced that translation with quotes included by English news organizations, which largely corroborated its accuracy.\nThe translated version of Kims speech did not include the words, \"Biden,\" \"Trump,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Russia,\" \"Ukraine,\" or \"Taliban.\"\nAnd although Kim mentioned that international sanctions had created challenges for North Koreans, he did not refer to the U.S. by name, Politico and CNN reported.\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram video claimed to show a speech in which Kim blamed Biden for the Israel-Hamas war and Russias invasion of Ukraine and said, \"I support Donald Trump for President in 2024.\"\nA reverse image search revealed that speech was from Oct. 10, 2020. A translation and news reports about the speechs content show that the English captions superimposed on the video are inaccurate. He did not mention Biden, Trump, Israel, Hamas, Russia or Ukraine.\nWe rate this claim False.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows Kim Jong-un delivering a speech. The entities 'North Korean leader' and 'Kim Jong-un' are accurately identified. However, the external validation check reveals a significant discrepancy.  The external check, with a lower confidence score (8), indicates that the caption is inaccurate regarding the timing of the speech.  The external source explicitly states the speech occurred in October 2020, not as a New Year's address as the caption suggests. This creates a conflict between the visual evidence (supporting the general claim of a speech) and the temporal accuracy (refuting the specific claim of a New Year's speech). Although the image shows Kim Jong-un speaking, the caption's claim that it's a New Year's speech is demonstrably false based on external evidence. Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context because, while internally consistent with the visual content, it is externally contradicted regarding a crucial detail: the timing of the event.  The lower confidence score of 8 reflects the uncertainty introduced by the conflict between the internally consistent visual and the externally verifiable temporal information. A higher confidence could not be assigned given that the specific claim (New Year's speech) is factually incorrect, even though the broader claim (Kim Jong-un giving a speech) is visually supported.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the image's content showing Kim Jong-un speaking, but external validation refutes the caption's claim that the speech is a New Year's address. This conflict leads to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

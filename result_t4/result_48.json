But more US pets are diagnosed with cancer than Nigerian people - so there are more machines per cancer patient in Nigeria than per pet with cancer in the US.\nIf the story intrigues you read more on the BBC News website.\nStreet vendor boss who jibed Mugabe is freed on bail\nA court in Zimbabwe has released a man on $200 (150) bail for saying President Robert Mugabe, 93, is \"daydreaming and old\", a rights group has tweeted:\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Mugabe is daydreaming...\nQuote Message\nMugabe must appreciate the role of the informal sector. Zimbabweans must understand that Mugabe is old and a dead man walking.\"\nMeanwhile, the state-owned Herald newspaper reports that police were deployed in and around Harare today as as a crackdown on illegal street vendors and pirate taxis was launched.\nSome vendors stayed away from their usual selling points, but others parts of the city were still bustling, says the BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare.\nLandmark paternity ruling in Morocco overturned\nA Morocccan court has reversed an earlier ruling which had - for the first time in the country's history - recognised a man as the father of a child born outside of marriage, reports Reuters news agency.\nThe decision by the appeals court in the coastal city of Tangiers has angered human rights activists.\nA lower court had ruled in January that the man was the father of a girl born to a woman who was not his wife, based on DNA test results provided by the mother.\nFollowing that decision, the father was ordered to pay the mother 100,000 Dirhams ($10,600; 8,000), Reuters reports, adding that the child was however not granted inheritance rights.\nToday's ruling overturns that judgement, and the mother has been ordered to pay legal costs, AFP quotes her defence lawyer as saying.\nThe lawyer, Ahmed Guennoun, added:\nQuote Message\nThis is a great disappointment for the mother and her loved ones. We are going to appeal to the Court of Cassation [Morocco's top court] and place our hopes in its judges.\"\nSex outside of marriage is banned in Morocco, where nearly 30,000 single mothers give birth every year according to a joint report in 2011 by the UN and women's rights NGO Insaf.\nAbortion has been legal in the country since 2015 in select cases such as pregnancies resulting from rape or malformation of the foetus.\nInsaf has criticised today's ruling, saying the Moroccan justice system was helping men avoid \"taking responsibility for their actions... to the detriment of a newborn\".\nThe organisation says single mothers in Morocco deal with \"exclusion, rejection, discrimination and even exploitation\".\nDeath of the Nile?\nPeter Schwartzstein\nCairo\nThe world's longest river is sick - and getting sicker.\nBooming populations have dirtied and drained it, while climate change threatens to cut its flow.\nAnd some fear that competition over its dwindling waters could trigger a regional conflict.\nThe rot starts at the source. For as long as the Nile has flowed, Ethiopias rains have made up the great bulk  over 80%  of its waters.\nThough slightly longer, the White Nile, which originates in East Africa's Lake Victoria and merges with the Ethiopian branch at Khartoum, carries a fraction of the volume.\nBut these rains are not falling as they used to. And that is potentially catastrophic for the entire basin.\nRead the full story on the BBC News website.\n'I thought Wenger had inside info about Weah'\nStanley Kwenda\nBBC Africa, London\nAt Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's press conference, I asked him whether he was surprised that his former player, Kolo Toure, had made the transition to assistant coach for Scottish side Celtic and the Ivory Coast national team.\nIn his response Mr Wenger chose to first congratulate another of his former players, George Weah on, he said, becoming the new president of Liberia.\nFor a moment I thought he had received a call from Weah confirming the result of Tuesday's presidential election.\nI knew the official results are not yet out but I thought Wenger may have better intelligence than me. His eyes were glinting, and he spoke with much excitement and a genuine congratulatory feel.\nWenger and Weah share a very special relationship and I will not be surprised if the Arsenal manager goes to Liberia for Weah's inauguration - that is if he wins.\nSee our earlier post for more details.\nThree men suspected of cannibalism freed in SA\nThree men accused of cannibalism in South Africa have been released from police custody after charges against them were provisionally withdrawn, a local newspaper reports.\nThey had been charged with murder and conspiracy to murder, as South Africa does not have a specific charge of cannibalism.\nProsecutors told a court in the farming town of Estcourt that the charges against the three had been provisionally withdrawn, and they may or may not be re-instated at a later stage, the Estcourt and Midlands News site reports, external.\nAFP news agency gives a different account, saying the three had been acquitted because of a lack of evidence.\nFour other men charged with them remained in police custody.\nPolice fired rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse crowds of people who hurled insults at the accused as they appeared in court, AFP news agency reports.\nThe men sat in the dock, hiding their faces with their hands and hooded tops, it adds.\nThe seven were arrested after police said one of them walked into a police station in August with a leg and a hand, and said he was tired of eating human flesh.\nAvoidable blindness to treble in next 40 years\nSammy Awami\nBBC Africa, Dar es Salaam\nGlobal rates of avoidable blindness are set to increase threefold in the next four decades, warns a report by the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), external.\nCountries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are feared to be most at risk.\nThe research points to 30 years of stagnation in tackling the leading cause of avoidable blindness, especially among people aged over 50.\nThe IAPB, an international alliance of eye care organisations, believes this stagnation is partly due to a rise in the world's ageing population\nCataracts, glaucoma and untreated cases of blurred vision are some of the leading causes of blindness, according to the report published in the Lancet medical journal.\nA lack of resources is blamed for sub-Saharan Africa's failure to match the progress seen in higher income countries, the report says, highlighting the need for a massive increase in eye care provision.\nMan arrested with '$740,000 stuffed in suitcases'\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

He had been planning to fly to Dubai, a spokesman for the elite police unit, the Hawks, was quoted as saying.\nHe added:\nQuote Message\nObviously our probe in this will be to determine the trail and origin of the money. We cannot rule out unearthing illicit activities as we go along.\nThe suspect is expected to appear at Bellville Magistrates Court in Cape Town on charges of contravening the Customs and Excise Act by failing to declare the cash, the news site reports.\nJustice after 47 years in South Africa\nAn apartheid-era policeman in South Africa, Joao Rodrigues, should be investigated on charges of accessory to murder and purgery over the 1971 death of political activist Ahmed Timol, an inquest judge has ruled.\nJudge Billy Mothle rejected Mr Rodrigues' testimony that Mr Timol had \"dived\" out of the 10th floor window of the police headquarters in the main city, Johannesburg.\nMr Timol had been \"pushed\" to his death, and had been murdered, the judge ruled.\nMr Timol's family welcomed the ruling, saying it felt \"vindicated\" after a decades-long campaign for the truth to emerge.\nMore than 70 activists had died in detention during apartheid, and the ruling is expected to lead to increased pressure on the democratically elected government to investigate their deaths.\nRead the full BBC story here.\nPolice question Nigerian music star Davido over death\nHelen Oyibo\nBBC News, Lagos\nPolice in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos say they are investigating Davido, whose birth name is David Adeleke, over the circumstances leading to the death of his friend, Tagbo Umeike.\nA police spokesman told BBC News Pidgin that Davido is not considered a suspect at this stage, but confirmed that the afrobeats star had been called in for an interview, along with relatives of the deceased who were there at the time of his death.\nThe spokesman added:\nQuote Message\nWe are investigating where he [Davido] went to, video footage, just to give a clearer picture of what happened.\nMr Tagbo, a friend of Davido, died on 3 October and his body was reportedly abandoned in front of a hospital in Lagos.\nDavido has consistently denied any involvement in the death.\nAnti-apartheid activist 'pushed' from police building\nA judge in South Africa has ruled that prominent anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol had been murdered after being pushed from a police building, overturning a 1972 ruling that he had jumped from the 10th floor and had committed suicide.\nTimol's death in police custody in October 1971 had caused global outrage, and his family had been campaigning since the end of apartheid in 1994 for the inquest to be reopened.\nHis family rejected the findings of the original inquest, saying it was a cover-up by the apartheid regime.\nTimol died six days before his 30th birthday.\nThis is the first time since the racist system of apartheid ended that a new inquest into the death of an activist has been held.\nMr Timol's relatives put intense pressure on the democratic state to re-open the inquest after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission - set up to investigate apartheid era atrocities - failed to investigate his death.\nLion bites car tyre... and gets a shock\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

However, the external check could not find any supporting evidence for the claim. The external check reports no information on protests in Angola on the given date. There's a significant discrepancy between the internal and external validation results. The confidence score is low due to the lack of corroborating external evidence. The visual evidence alone is insufficient to confirm the specific event described in the caption.  The image shows a protest, but that alone does not verify the location (Angola's capital Luanda), the date (Saturday), or the specific reason for the protest (demanding a new date for local government elections).  The image lacks any identifying markers to confirm the event details. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context due to the absence of external validation and uncertainty about the specific details of the protest shown in the image.",

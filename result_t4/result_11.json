        "content": "Claim:\nPresident Obama is set to replace the bald eagle as the U.S.'s national animal.\nOn 2 May 2016, disreputable web site American News published an article with a sensational title (\"Obama To Replace National Bird The Bald Eagle With THIS\"). Despite the clickbait claim, the text of this article made no such argument:\nAccording to recent reports, our nation is about to get a new animaland its quite a departure from the bald eagle, which has been the sole symbol of the United States for 234 years.\nReports indicate that the National Bison Legacy Act has just been passed by Congress, and is expected to pass through the Senate next week. The act denotes the bison as Americas national mammal and a historical symbol of the United States.\nThe eagle will reportedly still represent the nation, but it will no longer be the sole animal doing so. If passed, the bison will join the bald eagle, the oak, and the rose as a symbol for our country.\nDespite the title, the actual story was primarily based on factual information. The National Bison Legacy Act, which designated the bison as the national mammal of the United States, was passed by Congress at the end of April 2016. But while this legislation will give the United States its first national mammal, it will have no effect on the bald eagle's status as the United States' national bird, nor as its national symbol.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is False. While the article mentions the passing of the National Bison Legacy Act, which designates the bison as the national mammal, it explicitly states that this will not affect the bald eagle's status as the national bird or symbol.  The claim that Obama is replacing the bald eagle with the bison is a misrepresentation of the facts.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: The article from Snopes.com directly refutes the claim, stating: \"But while this legislation will give the United States its first national mammal, it will have no effect on the bald eagle's status as the United States' national bird, nor as its national symbol.\"",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The original news caption, stating that President Obama is set to replace the bald eagle with the bison as the U.S.'s national animal, is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence.  The internal check reveals a complete mismatch between the image (a bison) and the caption's claim about a presidential decision to change national symbols.  The image simply shows a bison; there's no visual element connecting it to President Obama or a national animal change. The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this complete lack of connection.\n\nThe external check corroborates this assessment with a confidence score of 8.  It cites a Snopes.com article that refutes the caption's claim.  The article clarifies that the National Bison Legacy Act designates the bison as a national mammal, but this does not affect the bald eagle's status as the national bird or symbol.  The external check's supporting points clearly show that the caption is a misrepresentation of the facts, twisting the meaning of the National Bison Legacy Act.\n\nThe disagreement between the caption and both the image and external factual evidence is significant. The image provides no visual support for the caption's assertion. The caption's claim is a fabricationâ€”an inaccurate portrayal of events.  The high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong and consistent evidence from both internal and external checks pointing towards the caption's falsity. The caption is not only unrelated to the image but presents entirely false information.\n\nDiscrepancies: There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both independently confirm the caption's falsity and lack of connection to the image.\n\nUncertainty: There is no uncertainty in the assessment.  The evidence clearly shows that the caption is out of context and factually inaccurate.\n\nVisual Tampering/Miscontextualization: There is no evidence of visual tampering or miscontextualization. The image is a straightforward depiction of a bison. The caption's fabrication is unrelated to any manipulation of the image itself.\n\nVisual Details: The visual details of the image (a bison in a natural setting) are completely unrelated to the caption's claim about a political decision and a change in the national animal. The image provides no context for the caption's claims.\n\nConclusion:  Based on the conclusive evidence from both internal and external checks, the caption is definitively out of context (OOC).  The high confidence score reflects the certainty of this assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context and factually inaccurate. The image shows a bison, but the caption falsely claims President Obama replaced the bald eagle with the bison as the national animal. External fact-checking confirms this is a misrepresentation of the National Bison Legacy Act."

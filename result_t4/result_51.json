        "content": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Protesters clashed with police outside Greece's parliament during a rally that drew tens of thousands of people Sunday against the Greek-Macedonia name deal. At least 10 police officers were injured.\nDemonstrators threw rocks, flares, firebombs, paint and other objects at riot police who responded with repeated volleys of tear gas. Some protesters jumped over a fence and tried to scale the steps, but officers chased them back down. One man draped in a Greek flag attacked police with a large stick, while others swung big flags on wooden poles and struck officers.\nPeople attending the rally said large clouds of tear gas led many to abandon the protest. The square in front of parliament had nearly emptied out by early evening, though small groups of protesters continued to clashed with officers.\nGreece's parliament is expected to start a debate Monday on ratifying the deal and vote on it by Friday. Macedonia's parliament has already approved it, agreeing that the country would go by the name North Macedonia.\nMacedonia and Greece struck the deal in June to end a decades-long dispute over Macedonia's name, which Greece says harbors territorial claims on its northern province of the same name.\nProtesters are against the deal because they believe that any use of the name Macedonia in the neighboring country's name is a usurpation of ancient Greek heritage and implies territorial claims on Greece.\nA statement from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' office blamed \"extremist elements and members of Golden Dawn\" - an extreme-right, anti-immigrant party - for the clashes on Sunday.\n\"In our democracy, citizens' free expression is an inalienable right, even for those who want to abolish democracy ... It is also the duty and obligation of those of us who do believe not to allow them. Let's isolate and condemn them,\" the statement said.\nPolice said in a statement that officers had been attacked by \"organized groups of individuals with special ferocity, (using) rocks, iron bars, wooden clubs, firebombs etc. ... Police forces acted according to operational plans and orders, showed restraint and professionalism and, using the appropriate methods, repelled the attacks.\"\nProtest organizers said they hoped to attract more than 600,000 people. Police released an official estimate of 60,000.\nWhile organizers had said about 3,000 buses would travel from northern Greece alone, police said that a total of 327 had arrived from across the country Sunday afternoon.\nAmong the people who addressed the protest were former conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, a member of the Mount Athos monastic community and a Greek-American former politician, Chris Spirou, once a member of New Hampshire's House of Representatives.\nIn northern Greece, farmers temporarily blocked the highway leading to the Macedonian border in solidarity. It later reopened.\nAbout 300 anarchists staged a counter-demonstration Sunday. Police erected barriers to prevent clashes. After their otherwise peaceful rally, anarchists burned a car with official license plates.\n___\nCostas Kantouris contributed reporting from Thessaloniki, Greece.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the accuracy of the news caption.  The internal check highlights the strong visual correspondence between the image and the caption's description: a rally in Athens with Greek flags and a seated woman.  The political context mentioned in the caption—the upcoming vote on the name change of North Macedonia—is highly relevant to the scene depicted. The external check corroborates the date and the context of a rally in Athens related to the Greece-Macedonia name agreement. Although external sources don't specifically mention a seated woman among flag-holders, this minor detail does not contradict the overall picture. A source mentions protests and the upcoming vote, both directly reflected in the image and caption. The high confidence scores from both checks, 10 and 8 respectively, reinforce the assessment.  There is no evidence of visual tampering or misrepresentation.  Visual details strongly support the claim of a rally in Athens with Greek flags; the presence of a seated woman is a minor detail that doesn't significantly impact the overall accuracy.  Therefore, the caption accurately represents the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The image aligns well with the description of a rally in Athens concerning the Greece-Macedonia name agreement. Minor discrepancies, like the specific mention of a seated woman, are inconsequential to the overall accuracy."

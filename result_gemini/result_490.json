Although this footage truly shows a large wildfire raging in the background of a highway commute, the video did not date from November 2018.\nThis video was actually shot during the Skirball fire near Bel-Air, California, in December 2017 and captured morning commuters driving on Interstate 405 (the San Diego Freeway), which was closed shortly after this video was taken:\nThe latest wildfire in Southern California broke out in Los Angeles County overnight near the Getty Center and the 405 Freeway -- a shocking sight for early morning commuters ...\nCalifornia resident Tiffany Anderson wrote on Instagram that she saw a \"gigantic ball of orange\" driving to work this morning.\n\"Im grateful to be safe; truly grateful,\" she wrote. \"My heart is sad today, especially for all the people losing everything and first responders and their families.\"",

      "explanation": "The news caption mentions \"California wildfires 2018 from freeway\", which is partially supported by Source 1.  Source 1 discusses a video of highway traffic near a California wildfire in November 2018, although it clarifies the video was from December 2017, not November 2018. The caption's time frame is inaccurate, but the core description of a freeway near a wildfire in California is present in the evidence.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly depicts a wildfire next to a freeway at night, which aligns with the caption's description of California wildfires in 2018. The external check also provides a relatively high confidence score (8), supporting the core description of a California freeway near a wildfire. Although the external check notes a discrepancy in the year (the video is from 2017, not 2018 as stated in the caption), the core elements of the caption—a California wildfire near a freeway—remain consistent with the evidence.  The discrepancy in the year does not invalidate the main points of the caption.  The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the visual evidence from the image, strongly support the caption's accuracy despite the minor time discrepancy. Therefore, I conclude that the caption is not out of context. The slight difference in the year mentioned is not substantial enough to deem the caption completely inaccurate. A confidence score of 9 reflects the high level of certainty based on the evidence, but the minor time discrepancy is accounted for by reducing the score from a perfect 10.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with minor discrepancies in the year of the wildfire. The core elements of the description are consistent with the evidence."

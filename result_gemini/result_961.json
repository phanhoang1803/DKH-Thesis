    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a discrepancy: while the image shows women in Mali, there's no evidence to support the claim that they are gold miners. The external check acknowledges the possibility of miners attending events in a gold-mining region like Mali, but it lacks sufficient evidence to confirm this. The low confidence score reflects the lack of supporting evidence for the \"gold miners\" aspect of the caption. Both checks agree that the location (Mali) is correctly identified, but disagree on the occupation of the women.  Given the limited information in the image and the ambiguous caption, it's not possible to definitively verify the caption's accuracy beyond the geographical location. The uncertainty stems from a lack of visual cues or contextual information linking these women to gold mining. The caption's assertion about their occupation is unsupported by the evidence present in the image. While it's not impossible that these women are gold miners attending an event, this interpretation is purely speculative. Therefore, the caption's claim regarding their profession is considered out of context and lacks strong supporting evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree on the image's location (Mali) but disagree on the occupation of the women. The lack of evidence linking the women to gold mining renders the caption's assertion as out of context."

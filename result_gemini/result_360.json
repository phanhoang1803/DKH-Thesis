      "explanation": "Kestrels are birds of prey that can be found in various habitats, including areas near human settlements.  Railway stations, while not their typical nesting grounds, are not outside the realm of possibility for a kestrel to appear, especially in an open area like a car park.  The location specified (Eskbank railway station in Midlothian) is geographically plausible. There is nothing inherently contradictory about a kestrel being present in a car park.  However, without photographic or eyewitness evidence, the claim remains somewhat speculative. ",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate.  The internal check highlights the plausibility of a kestrel being in a railway station car park, acknowledging the lack of explicit location confirmation in the image itself. The external check reinforces this by pointing out that kestrels are found in various habitats, including those near human settlements, making the presence of one at a railway station not improbable. The location details (Eskbank railway station in Midlothian) are deemed geographically plausible. Both checks offer a confidence score of 8, indicating a reasonably high degree of certainty.  There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks; they both support the caption's accuracy while acknowledging the lack of definitive visual confirmation of the location within the image.  The overall assessment is that the caption is not out of context, with a confidence score of 8 reflecting the level of certainty based on the available evidence. The uncertainty stems from the indirect nature of the evidence—the picture doesn't directly show the station or provide explicit location identifiers—but the overall context clues strongly support the caption's veracity.  Further evidence, such as a geotagged image or additional photographic context, would increase confidence. However, based on the existing evidence and the complementary results of both internal and external checks, the caption is considered not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is likely accurate, with confidence scores of 8.  The checks concur on the plausibility of a kestrel being at a railway station car park, and the location is verified as geographically valid. Uncertainty remains about the location being explicitly shown in the image, but this is outweighed by the overall contextual plausibility. "

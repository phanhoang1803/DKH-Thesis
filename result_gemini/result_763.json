        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows former child star Amanda Bynes working in product support.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nFormer child actress Amanda Bynes has been featured in misleading clickbait advertisements for several years, whether they were about her former work in the movie industry, what she was doing now, or a purported new job.\nFor example, a freeze-frame from a scene in the 2006 feature film \"She's the Man\" was displayed in countless ads. In the scene, Bynes lifts her shirt to prove she's a woman. Her character spent much of the movie pretending to be a boy so that she could play soccer. However, she did not appear topless in the film, despite what was implied by various ads. One ad claimed: \"[Photos] Top 17 Most Paused Movie Moments.\"\nIn January 2021, another online advertisement included the same moment from \"She's the Man.\" It also featured a second picture of Amanda Bynes purportedly now \"working 9-5\" in a product support job. The ad claimed: \"She Was A Super Star, Now She's Working 9-5.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a lengthy slideshow article on Gazillions.com. Its headline read: \"Former Stars Who Now Have Normal Jobs.\" Like the ad with the pictures of Bynes, the page for also said that she worked a job in \"product support.\" The description on the page claimed that she \"returned to work in the support industry.\"\nThis ad and story were both misleading. The photograph was real. It's also true that her mechanic-style shirt said \"Willie Product Support.\" However, the picture of Amanda Bynes did not show a her \"now\" working a new job \"9-5.\" The shirt simply seemed to be a style choice. It may also have been a joke based on the supposed company name. Also, the person's name on the shirt said \"Rich.\"\nA story from Us Weekly included the same picture with this caption: \"Amanda Bynes leaves a nail salon on October 10, 2019.\" Several other photographs from the same day were also published by In Touch Weekly.\nBynes was perhaps best known for her work in the 2003 film \"What a Girl Wants.\" She also appeared in \"Hairspray,\" \"Easy A,\" and \"Big Fat Liar.\" The former child star got her start on the wildly popular 1990s Nickelodeon television series \"All That,\" as well as \"The Amanda Show.\"",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim that Amanda Bynes is working in product support.  While a photo exists of Bynes wearing a shirt that says \"Willie Product Support,\" Snopes clarifies this image is misleading. The article states the photo was from 2019 and doesn't represent current employment. Therefore, the news caption is considered false.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that an advertisement falsely claimed Amanda Bynes was working in product support. The image used was from 2019 and not proof of current employment.  The shirt she was wearing was a stylistic choice, not indicative of a job.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Amanda Bynes is \"working in product support.\"  Internal validation finds the image insufficient to confirm Bynes' identity or occupation; the resemblance is suggestive but not conclusive. The confidence score reflects this uncertainty.  The external validation, however, provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim.  A Snopes article directly addresses the image, clarifying that it is misleading and that the photo from 2019 does not reflect current employment.  The shirt stating \"Willie Product Support\" was a stylistic choice for the photo, not proof of Bynes' job. The high confidence score of 8 from the external check is significant because it presents factual evidence from a reputable source refuting the claim. Thus, the caption is demonstrably out of context.  While internal analysis acknowledges the image's ambiguity, the external verification offers definitive proof that the caption is false.  This decisive external evidence outweighs the inconclusive internal assessment, leading to a high overall confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations agree that the caption is out of context. Internal validation highlights the image's ambiguity regarding Bynes' identity and profession, while external validation presents strong evidence from Snopes, debunking the claim about product support employment."

      "explanation": "The claim that a C-SPAN video shows Joe Biden confessing to bribing Ukraine is highly improbable and requires strong evidence.  C-SPAN is known for its unbiased coverage and airing of official statements. A confession of this magnitude would be widely reported and verified by multiple news sources. The lack of widespread reporting about such a confession casts serious doubt on the claim's veracity.  Furthermore, there is no reputable evidence to support the accusation of bribery.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The claim made in the original caption is factually inaccurate and unsupported by evidence. Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check points out the lack of visual evidence in the image to support the claim of Joe Biden confessing to bribery or mentioning Burisma.  The absence of any visual reference to C-SPAN further weakens the claim's credibility. The external check reinforces this by stating the improbability of such a confession being made on C-SPAN without extensive and verifiable reporting across various news platforms.  The gravity of the accusation makes the absence of multiple reputable news sources reporting it highly suspicious. There is no verifiable evidence to suggest the accusation of bribery is truthful. The high confidence scores from both checks (8 for internal and 2 for external) align in their conclusion that the claim is false, resulting in a high overall confidence score of 9. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks. Both assessments independently confirm the caption's inconsistency with the visual context and lack of verifiable external information.  The image solely presents Joe Biden at what appears to be a public speaking event. No elements within the image corroborate the claim of a confession of bribery or any mention of Burisma.   The external validation delves into the nature of C-SPAN's reporting and the lack of supporting evidence, emphasizing the extraordinary nature of the claim. The lack of reputable evidence is a crucial factor. The claim requires verifiable documentation from established news organizations or official sources to be considered credible. The absence of such evidence points to a false or highly misleading statement. The assertion that a C-SPAN video exists showcasing Biden confessing to bribery lacks any reliable evidence and is therefore deemed out of context and highly improbable. Entity analysis further supports this conclusion; no discernible entity in the image supports the caption's claim.  Considering the combined strength of internal and external evidence, the caption is definitively out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks decisively refute the caption's claim. The absence of visual evidence, coupled with the lack of corroborating news reports, strongly suggests the caption is out of context and inaccurate."

      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  Rome has a history of protests, and using a ribbon on a lamppost as a symbolic gesture is not unusual. However, without further context (e.g., the specific date, the nature of the protest), it's difficult to definitively verify the claim. The absence of protests could be due to various factors, including but not limited to time of year, specific events, or other circumstances. Therefore, while not inherently impossible, the claim needs external verification to confirm its accuracy.",

    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption consistent with the image, confirming the presence of a red ribbon on a lamppost in what appears to be Rome.  The confidence score of 10 reflects this alignment. However, the external check introduces crucial uncertainty. While acknowledging Rome's history of protests and the plausibility of using a ribbon as a symbolic gesture, it highlights the lack of definitive evidence to support the claim that the streets are \"usually full of protesters.\" The lower confidence score of 7 reflects this ambiguity. The absence of protestors could be situational (time of day, specific events, etc.), rendering the caption's assertion unverifiable.  There is no explicit mention of any specific protest in the image or surrounding information. The external check's supporting points are relevant and reasonable;  the city's protest history and the common use of symbolic gestures are both true.  However, the critical discrepancy lies in the verification of the \"usually full of protesters\" statement. Without corroborating evidence, we cannot confirm this aspect of the caption. Therefore, while the image contains the ribbon on a lamppost in a Roman setting (internal check), the caption's additional claim about the usual presence of protesters remains unsubstantiated (external check).  The final confidence score is lowered to 7, reflecting this unresolved discrepancy. The inherent uncertainty necessitates a cautious approach, resulting in the 'OOC' being classified as true because of the lack of verification for a key component of the caption. In summary, the image aligns internally with parts of the caption, but the external validation reveals a significant gap in verifying the claim regarding the typical presence of protestors, thus leading to an overall judgment of the caption being out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image-caption alignment regarding the ribbon and location. External check raises concerns about the claim of usual protests, lacking sufficient evidence for verification. Discrepancy results in a lower confidence and 'OOC' classification."

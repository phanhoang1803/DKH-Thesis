      "explanation": "The statement that New York state has legalized heroin is factually incorrect.  Heroin remains a highly controlled and illegal substance in New York and across the United States. There have been debates and policy changes regarding opioid addiction treatment and harm reduction strategies, but these do not constitute legalization of heroin itself.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that New York state has legalized heroin.  Both the internal and external checks decisively refute this claim. The internal check finds no mention of New York state or heroin legalization within the image itself.  The image depicts a person appearing to be struggling with drug addiction, holding a syringe. This visual context is entirely unrelated to any specific state's legislation on heroin.  The external check corroborates this finding by confirming that heroin remains illegal in New York and across the United States.  There's no evidence to support the assertion of legalization.  The external check provides strong evidence against the caption's claim by citing relevant drug laws.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10 for internal and 1 for external, indicating a lack of support for the claim) strongly support the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they are in complete agreement that the caption is false. The image shows an individual with what appears to be a syringe, indicative of drug use, but the image lacks any text, logos, or symbols that would link it to New York state or to a heroin legalization policy.  The combination of strong internal and external evidence leads to the assessment that the caption is out of context with extremely high confidence. ",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image contains no information related to New York or heroin legalization, and external sources confirm that heroin remains illegal in New York State.  There is complete agreement between the two validation methods."

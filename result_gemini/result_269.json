Murray, who left public life a few years ago to pursue a more conservative lifestyle, found out he was dying about three months ago but decided not to make a big deal out of it.\nAccording to his spokesman and lawyer, Art Tubolls, Murray left very simple instructions for his passing:\nBill wanted to see America unite under President Trump and come together to fight against all the things hes fought against his entire career. When he wrote the movie Ghostbusters he used Slimer as an example of how feeding something causes dependence. Stripes was to teach the average American that anyone can be a hero if the timing is right.\nNone of this was true: at the time this report was published, Bill Murray was still very much alive and only 68 years old. The report of his death was another fabrication by Conservative Tears, a site which is part of the America's Last Line of Defense network of websites and Facebook pages that pump out a steady stream of inflammatory and politically divisive misinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"",

Snopes identifies the origin of the claim as a false report from the website Conservative Tears, characterizing it as misinformation.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check notes a discrepancy between the image (showing Bill Murray) and the caption's claim of his death and political statement.  The external check provides strong evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, directly refuting the claim. Snopes attributes the false report to the website Conservative Tears and labels it as misinformation.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both agree that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The high confidence scores (10 for both) from both checks reinforce the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context.  The image simply depicts Bill Murray; it does not support the claim made in the caption about his death, age at death, or supposed political views.  The external evidence decisively demonstrates that the information in the caption is false. Therefore, there is no uncertainty in the conclusion; the caption is demonstrably out of context.",

The claim regarding Bill Murray's death, age at death and political views is definitively false according to Snopes.com. The image provides no evidence to support the caption's claim."

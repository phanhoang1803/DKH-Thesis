    "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption \"The Supreme Court in Washington.\" The internal check finds a perfect match between the image and the caption, giving a confidence score of 10.  The external check verifies the location of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., also with a confidence score of 10, citing the publicly known fact of its location. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks.  The high confidence scores from both checks, combined with the clear visual evidence in the image, lead to a final confidence score of 10.  There is no reason to doubt the caption's accuracy. The image unequivocally depicts the Supreme Court building, and its location in Washington, D.C., is a well-established and verifiable fact.  No further investigation or analysis is needed to confirm this. The alignment between the image content and the caption's description is complete and consistent with readily available information.  In essence, the caption is not only accurate but also unambiguous and easily verifiable. There is no uncertainty in this assessment. No conflicts arise from comparing the internal and external checks; they fully concur. The entity analysis also supports this conclusion: The image shows the Supreme Court building, the caption states \"The Supreme Court in Washington,\" and external knowledge confirms the building's location.  Given the high levels of confidence from both verification methods and the direct alignment between image, caption, and external knowledge, the final verdict is that the caption is perfectly consistent with the context provided.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the caption's accuracy with high confidence scores (10/10).  No discrepancies were found."

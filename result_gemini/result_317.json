      "explanation": "The Great Belt Bridge is a real structure in Denmark, and train accidents, while thankfully uncommon, are possible.  However, there's no immediate information available to confirm or deny whether a specific train accident occurred on that bridge. The statement is plausible but lacks verifiable evidence to support it definitively.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy due to the apparent alignment between the image content and the caption's description. However, the external check exhibits low confidence (4), indicating a lack of verifiable evidence to confirm the specific train accident mentioned in the caption.  The external check highlights the plausibility of the event (train accidents on bridges are possible) but points out the absence of confirming news reports or other sources to corroborate the claim. This discrepancy between internal and external assessments leads to a low overall confidence score. The core issue lies in the absence of external validation confirming the reported train accident on the Great Belt Bridge.  The image itself strongly suggests a train accident and rescue operation, but this visual evidence alone is insufficient to definitively confirm the specifics mentioned in the caption.  A news report, official statement, or other reliable source documenting this specific event is needed for complete verification. While the Great Belt Bridge's existence in Denmark and the possibility of train accidents are established facts, they do not alone validate the specific event depicted in the image.  Therefore, without external corroboration, we must conclude that the caption, although plausible based on the image, remains unverified and potentially out of context.  A higher confidence score would necessitate conclusive evidence linking the image to a documented train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Nyborg, Denmark. The low confidence score reflects this evidentiary gap. The potential for misinformation or misidentification necessitates caution in accepting the caption without further confirmation.  Therefore, despite the image's strong internal coherence with the caption's description, the lack of robust external validation forces a conclusion of the caption being potentially out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's alignment with image content. External check has low confidence (4) due to the absence of independent verification for the specific train accident mentioned. Discrepancy between checks leads to low overall confidence and an 'out of context' assessment.  The lack of external corroboration is the primary reason for the low confidence and 'OOC' judgment."

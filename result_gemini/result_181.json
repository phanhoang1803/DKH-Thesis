Supporters celebrating his win in Kinshasa is consistent with typical post-election scenarios. However, without specific details of the election or date, verification requires additional sources. The caption lacks the precision to confidently assess the exact date mentioned. ",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check has low confidence (0) because the image lacks identifying information to confirm the individuals are supporters of Felix Tshisekedi or that the location is Kinshasa.  The external check has moderate confidence (8) because the scenario of supporters celebrating a political victory is plausible, and Kinshasa is the capital of the DRC where Tshisekedi served as president. However, the lack of specific details regarding the election or the exact date in the image prevents definitive confirmation. The discrepancy arises from the image's lack of concrete evidence supporting the caption's specific claims.  There's no visible signage, banners, or other clear indicators to verify the claims. The external check relies on general knowledge about political events, which isn't sufficient for a precise verification.  Given that the image itself lacks direct evidence supporting the caption and the external validation primarily relies on plausible inference rather than specific details, the overall confidence score remains low. The internal check's low score is decisive because it directly assesses the visual evidence in the image.  While the external check offers contextual plausibility, it cannot compensate for the image's lack of direct evidence. Therefore, I conclude that the caption is likely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds no evidence to support the caption's specific claims. External check finds the scenario plausible but lacks precise details to confirm. Discrepancy arises from the image's lack of confirming information and the external check relying on general knowledge. Overall low confidence due to insufficient evidence."

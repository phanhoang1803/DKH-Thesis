      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The statement is factually plausible. Presidential elections in many countries involve citizens queuing up at polling stations to cast their votes.  The description of voting happening in a different part of the city on a subsequent day is also consistent with how elections are conducted in many places, with multiple polling stations open across a city over a period of time.  However, without specific context (country, date, etc.), it's impossible to verify this claim definitively. ",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both suggest a degree of plausibility, rating the caption's accuracy as likely true, but not definitively so.  The internal check highlights the image's visual depiction of a queue, which aligns with the caption's description of people queuing to vote. However, the lack of explicit voting materials in the image introduces uncertainty. The confidence score of 8 reflects this partial alignment and the contextual inference.  The external check strengthens the plausibility. It correctly points out the common practice of voters queuing during elections. The mention of a presidential election adds to the likelihood of the image capturing an election queue.  The confidence score of 8 for the external check demonstrates the reasonable expectation of such scenes during elections. However, similar queues may appear in other contexts (e.g., for aid distribution).  Both checks recognize the absence of definitive proof. Neither provides conclusive evidence to confirm or deny the caption's claim that this is a queue specifically for a presidential election.   The lack of specific information regarding the location, date, and other crucial contextual details significantly hampers definitive verification. Therefore, both scores remain at 8, indicating a probable but not certain link between the image and the caption.  The final assessment leans toward 'out of context' (OOC=True) primarily because of the lack of explicit voting cues in the image. Although plausible, the image doesn't conclusively prove it depicts a presidential election voting queue. The overall confidence score is lowered to 7, reflecting this uncertainty despite the plausible interpretation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible but lack definitive proof. The image shows a queue, consistent with election voting; however, voting materials are absent.  External validation supports the common occurrence of voter queues in elections. The lack of concrete details leads to uncertainty. Therefore, the caption is considered potentially out of context."

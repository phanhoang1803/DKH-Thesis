      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  The National Wallace Monument and St. Mary's Church (or its remains) are both real and located in Stirling, Scotland. It's geographically possible for the monument to be framed through an arch of a church, especially a former one, suggesting the image could depict an actual view. However, without visual verification, it remains uncertain if this specific framing exists.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Internal consistency check shows high confidence (10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The image clearly shows the National Wallace Monument framed by an archway, which is consistent with the description. The external check also supports the caption's plausibility (confidence score of 8), pointing out the existence of both the National Wallace Monument and the former St. Mary's Church in Stirling, Scotland, making the depicted scene geographically possible. While external verification doesn't definitively confirm this specific framing exists, the high confidence from the internal check, combined with the plausible external evidence, strongly suggests the caption is accurate. There is no significant conflict between the internal and external checks. Both checks agree that the caption is likely accurate.  The only limitation is the lack of definitive visual confirmation that this precise view from St. Mary's Church actually exists. The high internal confidence score, along with the supporting external plausibility, outweighs this uncertainty. Therefore, the caption is deemed not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with high confidence scores.  The only limitation is a lack of definitive visual confirmation of the exact framing."

But, they dont know that. And thats just another example of how lazy the Hispanics are as a race. And the main reason why theyre so afraid of my dad is hes going to deport them back to Asia when he wins the election. Its a well-known fact that fear makes people to crazy things. Its made them come and try to suck up to me so Id help them get in my dads good graces. Yeah, good luck with that.\nMy father is not a stupid man, and I can tell you he didnt father a stupid son, either, Eric Trump added. And when he does deport all these lazy Hispanics back to Asia where they came from, hell be doing that for two reasons. The first one is obvious  we dont need lazy people in this country. The second is thats part of his plan of taking back American jobs from China. Thats why hell send most of the Hispanics back to the Chinese capital of Bangkok, which is where most American jobs are located at the moment.\nHowever, Eric Trump never said that his father would send Hispanics \"back to Asia.\" Politicops, like its sister site Newslo, is a \"hybrid\" web site that publishes a mixture of news and fiction:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nIn this case, Politicops started with a real comment that Eric Trump made on a radio show explaining how Hispanics \"couldn't wait\" for his father to become president:\nPeople often talk about Hispanics, Eric Trump said earlier this week on Irish radios RTE Radio1s \"Drivetime.\"\nYou know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me, Listen, I cant wait for your father to be president. Hes going to bring jobs back to the United States. Hes going to end the nonsense. Hes going to create good trade deals. Hes going to create better education. Hes going to create a better family structure.\nReaders of Politicops can find out which portion of the article is fake and which portion is real by clicking on the \"Show Facts / Hide Facts\" button included at the top of articles:",

    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check notes that the image shows Donald Trump and Eric Trump, but provides no evidence to support the claim in the caption.  The lack of context within the image regarding the alleged statement about Hispanic people and Asia makes the caption's claim unsubstantiated. The external check uses Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, to confirm that the quote attributed to Eric Trump is false. Snopes explicitly states that the quote originated from a fake news article.  This external verification provides strong evidence against the caption's accuracy. Both the internal and external checks yield high confidence scores (10), pointing to a conclusive result.  There is no conflict between the two checks; they both independently verify that the caption is out of context. The image alone doesn't offer evidence about the statement, and the external source definitively debunks the claim. Therefore, combining both evaluations solidifies the conclusion that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context with respect to the provided image.",

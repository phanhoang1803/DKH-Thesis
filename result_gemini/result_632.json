      "explanation": "While it is plausible that a goose would shelter a puppy from the cold, and that a man in Montana might find such a scene, there is insufficient evidence to determine the veracity of this specific anecdote without additional information or external verification.  The story has elements of heartwarming coincidence, which are common in viral content, but not necessarily indicative of truth. The fact that the goose is described as 'shaking with cold' suggests that the goose was also in need of rescue. This aspect adds to the plausibility but also raises questions about the timing and sequence of events. The phrase 'surprise is capital' is vague and stylistic, hindering a clear assessment of the situation.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check identified a significant discrepancy: the caption mentions Montana and a man finding the goose, neither of which are depicted in the image. The image shows a goose sheltering a puppy, but the context of location and discovery is entirely absent.  The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the story's core element—a goose sheltering a puppy from cold—but notes the lack of verifiable details.  The external check highlights the story's potential for exaggeration and the common nature of heartwarming animal rescue narratives in viral content.  The phrase \"surprise is capital\" is vague and doesn't offer any concrete information. Both checks agree on the lack of evidence supporting the specific details provided in the caption, such as the location and the man's involvement.  The external check's higher confidence score (7) is primarily attributed to the plausibility of the core event, while the lower confidence score of the internal check (0) stems from the direct contradiction of essential contextual elements. Because the image lacks these crucial contextual details, and both internal and external checks confirm that this information is missing and potentially inaccurate, we conclude that the caption is out of context.  The confidence score of 4 reflects the uncertainty regarding the underlying event, but the strong consensus regarding the lack of supporting evidence in the image and the implausibility of the stated context leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption lacks supporting evidence from the image. The internal check directly refutes the location and discovery details; the external check acknowledges the plausibility of the core narrative but highlights the lack of verifiable information and potential for exaggeration.  The overall assessment is that the caption is out of context."

    "explanation": "The caption states that International Women's Day was celebrated by community organizations in Nairobi, Kenya on a Monday.  The internal check aligns with the image, showing women in Nairobi celebrating with a Kenyan flag and what seems to be a celebratory banner, indicating a high likelihood that it was a celebration of International Women's Day. The external check supports the fact that International Women's Day is globally recognized, and community participation in Nairobi is plausible. However, the lack of specific details about the organizations and the specific nature of the celebration limits the confidence score.  There is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both support the overall claim, although external verification is limited by a lack of specific information to definitively confirm the connection to International Women's Day beyond the general plausibility and visual context of the celebration. The image context strongly suggests a celebration aligning with the caption's claim. The confidence score reflects this alignment with some reservations about external validation due to the lack of specific information to directly verify the organizations mentioned in the caption. The overall assessment is that the caption is likely accurate but not definitively verifiable based on the given evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's claim, although external verification is limited by a lack of specific details to fully confirm the connection to a specific International Women's Day event beyond the visual evidence and the general plausibility of such a celebration."

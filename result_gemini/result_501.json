They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,\" Naty Gutierrez told Reuters news agency.\nA small group of protesters clashed with riot police as the peaceful rally ended.\n\"The nation has triumphed. They wanted to intimidate the people but the people are here,\" said Mr Maduro at a rally in central Caracas he said was attended by 30,000 people.\n\"We have defeated an attempted coup that tried to fill Venezuela and Caracas with violence, death,\" he said.\nThe opposition hopes the march will pressure the electoral authorities into allowing them to launch the second petition needed to trigger the recall referendum as soon as possible.\nTiming is key as the date when the referendum is held will determine what happens next.\nIf a referendum should go against the president before 10 January, new elections will be held, which the opposition hopes to win.\nBut if it is held after that date and Mr Maduro is recalled, his loyal vice-president will serve out the end of his term until 2019.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The caption \"Government supporters at a political rally for Mr. Maduro in Caracas\" aligns well with the image and corroborating evidence.  Internal validation reveals a high confidence score of 8, primarily due to the strong visual cues within the image. The image depicts a large crowd holding flags and signs clearly supporting Maduro, with his image visible on a sign within the crowd. The setting appears consistent with Caracas based on visual clues and the context of the event. External validation further strengthens this conclusion, achieving a confidence score of 8. A reliable source directly mentions \"Mr. Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers,\" which directly supports the caption's assertion. The source also mentions Maduro speaking at a rally in Caracas, attended by a large number of people, adding to the consistency between the caption and external information.  There is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both checks independently arrive at a high confidence level, indicating a strong alignment between the caption, the image content, and external evidence. The slight difference in confidence score (8 vs. 8) is negligible and does not impact the overall assessment. There is no uncertainty based on available evidence; the caption accurately describes the scene.",

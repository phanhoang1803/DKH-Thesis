November is a plausible timeframe for such an event. However, without specific details of the statement's content or date, it's not definitively verifiable.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check exhibits high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy due to perfect alignment between the image content and the caption's description of Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street in London. The mention of November is considered acceptable because the image itself does not provide a specific date, allowing for some flexibility in the caption's temporal placement.  The external check, while slightly less confident (score 8), still supports the caption's veracity.  Theresa May's tenure as Prime Minister is a well-established fact, and Prime Ministers routinely make announcements outside 10 Downing Street. The lack of a precise date in the caption is the only reason for a lower confidence score externally; the month of November is deemed plausible given the context of British political life.  There's no significant conflict between the internal and external checks. Both agree that the image and caption align well, with the external check slightly more cautious due to the absence of a specific date for the event in the caption.  The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the lack of contradictory evidence, lend strong support to the caption's accuracy. The absence of a specific date in the caption is not sufficient to cast doubt on the overall accuracy, given the inherent uncertainties in associating images with precise timestamps.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks validate the caption with high confidence.  Minor uncertainty arises from the caption's imprecise timeframe, but this does not contradict the main factual elements."

Katy Perry has never made such a statement, and cannibalism is illegal and morally reprehensible in almost every part of the world. The statement about human flesh being the finest meat is not only untrue, it is offensive and reflects a gross misunderstanding of human ethics and the nature of food sources.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check flags the caption as likely false because the image only shows Katy Perry and provides no evidence to support the claim about her views on human flesh. The external check strongly refutes the caption, stating that it's entirely fabricated and citing the illegality and moral repugnance of cannibalism.  There's no credible evidence to suggest Katy Perry ever made such a statement. Both checks align perfectly in determining that the caption is entirely out of context and false. The high confidence scores (10 for both) from both internal and external checks reinforce the conclusion that the statement is completely unfounded and fabricated.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively show that the caption is out of context and false.  The claim about Katy Perry's views on human flesh is unsubstantiated and contradicts basic facts about legality and morality."

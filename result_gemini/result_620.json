      "explanation": "The statement 'Fords awaiting shipment at a storage lot in Chongqing' is plausible. Chongqing is a major city in China, a significant manufacturing and export hub.  Ford, as a global automaker, likely has distribution networks and storage facilities in such locations. The presence of unshipped vehicles in a storage lot is a common occurrence in the automotive industry. However, without specific evidence (e.g., photographs, news articles, Ford's official statements), it remains difficult to definitively confirm the claim. ",
      "supporting_points": "- Chongqing is a major industrial and transportation center in China.\n- Ford operates globally and has extensive supply chains.\n- It is common for unshipped vehicles to be stored in lots before distribution.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses low confidence (confidence_score: 3) because the image shows numerous cars in a parking lot, but they aren't identifiable as Fords, and Chongqing isn't explicitly named in the image.  The external check, however, shows higher confidence (confidence_score: 8) due to the plausibility that Ford would have a distribution center in a major Chinese city like Chongqing, and that unshipped vehicles are commonly stored in such lots.  The discrepancy stems from the lack of direct evidence within the image to confirm that the vehicles are Fords or that the location is specifically Chongqing.  Both checks acknowledge the uncertainty: the internal check due to lack of visual confirmation, and the external check due to absence of definitive proof (e.g., official Ford statements or news articles). Since the internal check casts doubt on the core claim (Ford vehicles in Chongqing), despite the external check's plausibility argument, it's safer to lean towards a conclusion that the caption is out of context. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty stemming from the lack of concrete evidence to confirm the details mentioned in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check expresses low confidence due to lack of visual confirmation of Ford vehicles and Chongqing location; external check shows more confidence based on the plausibility of Ford having a distribution center in Chongqing but also acknowledges lack of definitive proof.  The lack of direct visual evidence in the image leads to a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

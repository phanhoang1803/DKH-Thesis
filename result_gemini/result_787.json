    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy, based on the clear visual identification of President Trump in what appears to be the Oval Office setting.  The entities (President Trump, Oval Office) are aligned and consistent with the image content. The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of the caption (score 8), points out the lack of specific temporal information (date and time) making definitive verification impossible. However, it supports the caption by noting the common practice of presidents using the Oval Office for national addresses.  There's no significant conflict between the internal and external checks; the external check's lower confidence score is primarily due to the lack of precise temporal details, not a contradiction of the image's content.  Both checks agree that the caption is highly probable, though not definitively verifiable without additional information. Considering the strong internal validation and the supporting evidence from the external check, we can confidently conclude the caption is not out of context. The final confidence score reflects the slight uncertainty introduced by the lack of specific temporal information in the external verification.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption (confidence 10), identifying President Trump in an Oval Office-like setting. External check supports plausibility but notes lack of precise temporal details (confidence 8). Overall, high confidence in caption accuracy despite lack of precise temporal information."

The company has not mentioned this alleged remake in any press releases, and we found no genuine news articles reporting that the company was planning to remake it. Bedknobs and Broomsticks was also absent from a recent list of upcoming live action Disney remakes.\nThe poster itself is a composite of at least three different images. Kate Winslet's face, for instance, was taken from an advertisement for Lancme, and the hair in this image was taken from a still shot of the Dolores Umbridge character from the Harry Potter movie series:\nThe body in this image came from a still shot of actress Claire Foye as Queen Elizabeth II in the historical drama The Crown:",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check, based solely on the provided image, correctly identifies the movie poster for \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" and the presence of the actress.  However, the external validation check provides strong evidence from Snopes that contradicts the caption's claim. Snopes definitively states that Disney did not announce a remake of \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" with Kate Winslet in March 2018.  The high confidence score of 10 from both checks highlights a significant discrepancy. The internal check assesses only the image's content, verifying the presence of entities mentioned in the caption.  It does not, and cannot, assess the truthfulness of the caption's claim about Disney's announcement. The external check, on the other hand, examines external sources to assess the accuracy of the caption.  The conflict arises because the image itself is consistent with a potential remake announcement (showing a poster of the movie with an actress), but external evidence proves that the announcement never happened.  The external check's evidence, based on a Snopes fact-check, is decisive and strongly indicates that the caption is factually incorrect.  Therefore, the caption is out of context, as the claim it makes is demonstrably false despite the image being consistent with the possibility of the claim being true.  The high confidence is due to the strong evidence from both checks, with the external check decisively refuting the caption's central claim.  The image only confirms the presence of elements mentioned in the caption, not their veracity within the context of the stated event.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation confirms the presence of entities in the image, aligning with parts of the caption. However, external validation via a Snopes fact-check decisively proves that the caption's central claim (Disney's announcement) is false, resulting in an overall out-of-context assessment."

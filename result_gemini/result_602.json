      "explanation": "Oyo's presence in major cities like New Delhi is widely known, and SoftBank's investment in and pressure on Oyo to improve profitability have been reported in the media. Therefore, the core elements of the caption align with publicly available information. However, without specific details about the mentioned hotel or the exact nature of SoftBank's pressure, a definitive verdict cannot be made.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is not out of context. The image clearly shows an Oyo hotel, aligning with the caption's claim.  The mention of SoftBank's pressure on Oyo is not directly depicted in the image but is factually accurate based on widely reported news and financial information. The internal check gives a confidence score of 8 because the image only directly supports the part about it being an Oyo hotel in New Delhi; the SoftBank information, while accurate, is not visually present. The external check also gives a confidence score of 8 because, while confirming the accuracy of the information about Oyo and SoftBank, it lacks specific details to provide an absolute confirmation of the caption's assertion. The combination of the checks, despite not reaching a perfect 10, strongly suggests the caption's overall accuracy.  There is no significant discrepancy or conflict between the two checks, both supporting the claim with high levels of confidence within their respective limitations.The primary limitation is that the image does not visually verify the financial relationship and pressures mentioned concerning SoftBank. However, given the readily available public information about the business relationship and OYO's financial challenges, this omission doesn't invalidate the caption's essence. Therefore, a conservative confidence score of 8 is appropriate, reflecting a high degree of likelihood that the caption accurately reflects the situation depicted and the broader context surrounding the Oyo company.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks agree that the caption is not out of context, with confidence scores of 8 each. The image clearly shows an Oyo hotel, and external sources confirm SoftBank's involvement with Oyo and its financial pressures. The absence of explicit visual confirmation of SoftBank's involvement in the image is the only limitation, but widely available public knowledge supports the claim."

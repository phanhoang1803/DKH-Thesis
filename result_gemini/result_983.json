However, without specific knowledge of the exact dates of the Dahlia Dreams display and Chinese New Year in a particular year, it's impossible to confirm the timing is accurate. The caption doesn't contain anything obviously false.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both support the general plausibility of the caption. However, both checks also highlight uncertainty. The internal check notes that while the image shows a Chinese New Year celebration setting, it doesn't explicitly show dahlias. The external check acknowledges that while dahlias are used in displays, Singapore celebrates Chinese New Year, and people do take photos, the exact timing of the \"Dahlia Dreams\" display relative to Chinese New Year requires further verification.  Neither check definitively proves or disproves the caption, but the uncertainty in both warrants a cautious assessment.  The most significant discrepancy lies in the emphasis. The internal check focuses on the alignment of the event with Chinese New Year, noting the lack of explicit dahlia identification, while the external check, though accepting the context, emphasizes the need to externally verify the exact timing. This difference does not represent a conflict, but instead emphasizes the lack of conclusive evidence to definitively confirm the caption's accuracy. The combined confidence score reflects this uncertainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal and external validations both find the caption plausible but highlight uncertainties about the exact timing and the prominence of dahlias in the image. While the scene aligns with Chinese New Year, a definitive confirmation requires external verification of the event's date.  The lack of conclusive evidence leads to a cautious assessment."

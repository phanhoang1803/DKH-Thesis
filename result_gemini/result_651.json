      "explanation": "The image shows a group of people detaining a person in a dark uniform.  While it's not explicitly clear that the detained person is a Mexican official, the presence of a Mexican national is supported by the image's context. The caption's assertion about dragging is partially supported, however, the image mainly depicts the person being held down and restrained.",

      "explanation": "While it is possible for extreme events to occur during migrant caravans, dragging a Mexican official through the streets is a serious claim requiring strong evidence.  The claim's plausibility is low due to the severity of the action and potential for immediate intervention by authorities.  Further investigation is needed to verify the event. The lack of widespread reporting would suggest a low likelihood of the claim's truth.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows some alignment with the caption, with a confidence score of 8. The image depicts a group of people restraining an individual in a dark uniform, which could potentially be interpreted as dragging, depending on the context. However, the claim of the restrained person being a \"Mexican official\" lacks direct visual evidence. The external check, with a confidence score of 3, strongly counters the caption.  It highlights the implausibility of such a serious event (dragging a Mexican official) occurring without widespread reporting. The external check emphasizes the lack of corroborating evidence and the severity of the claim. This discrepancy between the internal and external checks indicates a significant issue with the accuracy of the caption. While the image shows a physical altercation, the specifics in the caption—identifying the restrained person as a Mexican official and describing their treatment as \"dragging\"—are unsupported by visual evidence and contradicted by the likelihood of such an event going unreported. The external check's emphasis on the lack of widely available corroborating reports is a crucial factor. The overall confidence in the caption's accuracy is very low. While the image shows a confrontation, there's insufficient evidence to support the specific details of the caption. Therefore, the caption is considered out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially supports the caption (confidence 8), while external check strongly refutes it (confidence 3). The discrepancy and lack of supporting evidence for the caption's specific details lead to an out-of-context classification."

        "content": "An old image showing Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn wearing t-shirts with President Donald Trumps name and face on them, with a post claiming that the two Hollywood stars are big Trump supporters, has resurfaced yet again.\nThe July 27, 2016, Facebook post shows a photo of the two walking arm in arm, with Russell wearing a shirt that says \"Ive jihad it.\" Under the slogan on the shirt is an image of Trump shooting a gun and the word \"ISIS\" inside a circle-backslash symbol, referring to the Islamic State militant group. Hawns shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse search of the image shows it to be doctored, and PolitiFact previously reported on this same photo in November 2018, rating it Pants on Fire.\nThe original photo was taken in September 2015, while the two actors were walking in Los Angeles, according to an article from PopSugar. The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russells shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nOur ruling\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts. A reverse image search found the photo to be doctored. We rate this Pants on Fire.",

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) that the image depicts Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wearing Donald Trump t-shirts. However, the external check, also with high confidence (score 10), contradicts this, stating that the image is fabricated; the shirts were digitally added to a pre-existing photograph.  The external check provides evidence from Politifact and Snopes, reputable fact-checking sources, supporting its claim.  The discrepancy arises because the internal check only analyzes the image itself, while the external check uses additional sources to assess the image's authenticity.  The high confidence scores from both checks indicate strong evidence on both sides of the argument.  Since the external check is based on evidence beyond the image itself (verifying the image's origin and alterations), it carries more weight. The entity alignment is perfect according to the internal check, but the digital manipulation renders this alignment irrelevant. Therefore, given the compelling external evidence from verified sources, the original caption is deemed out of context.",

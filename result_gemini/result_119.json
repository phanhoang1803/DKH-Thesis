  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Internal validation confirms the image depicts Steve King, a representative from Iowa serving in Congress. The internal check's high confidence score (10) stems from the clear visual identification of Steve King.  External validation, while supporting Steve King's congressional service from Iowa, introduces uncertainty regarding the precise number of terms served (nine). The external check's confidence score is 8, reflecting the need for further verification from official sources.  Discrepancies exist solely in the number of terms; the core information (Steve King's identity, his status as an Iowa representative, and his congressional service) is consistently supported.  Weighing both checks, the overall confidence is 9.  The slight reduction accounts for the unverified claim of nine terms.  There's no conflict concerning the key elements of the caption, only regarding the specific duration of his service.  Given the strong visual confirmation of the individual shown in the image, the caption's core accuracy outweighs the uncertainty surrounding the exact number of terms.  Additional research would be needed to decisively verify the 'ninth term' detail.  Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the caption is deemed largely accurate, yet requires minor qualification regarding term length.  The overall assessment considers the strong alignment between the image and the central facts presented in the caption, emphasizing the necessity of acknowledging the unverified aspect of the stated term.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (score 10), while external validation confirms the core facts but expresses uncertainty about the number of terms (score 8). The final assessment reflects a high degree of confidence in the caption's accuracy, with a minor reservation concerning the 'ninth term' claim."

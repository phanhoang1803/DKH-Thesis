        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

Source 1 explicitly states that in March 2020, a video circulated on social media showing a 5G tower being torn down in China, with the claim that people feared it was causing the COVID-19 pandemic.  The source then proceeds to debunk this claim, clarifying that the video is real but miscaptioned and predates the pandemic.",

    "explanation": "The original caption states that in March 2020, a video circulated on social media showing a 5G tower being torn down in China due to fears of its link to the COVID-19 pandemic. The internal check reveals a discrepancy: the image shows a video related to Hong Kong protests and the destruction of surveillance infrastructure, not 5G towers in China, and lacks the COVID-19 context mentioned in the original caption.  The confidence score for the internal check is 7, indicating a significant mismatch. The external check, however, supports the original caption's claim about the existence of a video circulating in March 2020, showing the destruction of a 5G tower in China amid COVID-19 fears. This check has a higher confidence score of 10, indicating strong supporting evidence.  The conflict arises because the internal check focuses on the specific content of the image, which contradicts the original caption's details concerning location and the COVID-19 narrative.  The external check, on the other hand, verifies a broader claim regarding the existence of a similar video in circulation, irrespective of its specifics.  Since the original caption focuses on the video's purported reason for circulation and its specific location, and the internal check validates that the provided image does not match the details given in the original caption. A synthesis of the results shows that while a video matching parts of the original caption's description existed, the specific video in the image does not align with the information within the original caption. Therefore, considering that the internal check directly evaluates the provided visual evidence against the original caption, its lower confidence score is less relevant when compared to the higher confidence score from the external check, which supports the existence of a video with similar characteristics mentioned in the original caption. However, the differences between the video described and the video shown still leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context regarding the specific visual evidence. The confidence score of 8 reflects the high confidence in the external verification but accounts for the conflict in the internal check. The conclusion is based on a synthesis of all evidence.  The caption is out of context for the image shown, although external sources confirm the existence of a similar video circulated with claims matching the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals significant discrepancies between the image content and the original caption (location, focus on 5G vs. surveillance infrastructure, absence of COVID-19 context).  External check validates a similar video's existence but not the specifics of the image's content.  There is a conflict between these two checks; however, the image content fails to support the caption's claims, leading to an out-of-context assessment."

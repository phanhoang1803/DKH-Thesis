The photograph seen here is real, however -- but its explanation is an artistic rather than a miraculous one.\nThe person pictured here is artist Rob Ferrel of San Antonio, Texas, who uses a variety of media to create his artworks, including salt and other food products, as reported on Oddity Central:\nA true artist doesnt really need expensive tools and materials to produce something beautiful, and San Antonio artist Rob Ferrel is the perfect example. For months, he has been treating his Instagram followers with highly realist portraits that he creates using nothing but salt, a few brushes, and a piece of cardstock.\nFerrel begins by pouring salt on a table and then moves it around with brushes until recognizable features begin to emerge. He also uses cardstock for clean, sharp lines. Once the portrait is ready, he photographs it and posts it to Instagram, and then gathers up all the salt to make his next masterpiece.\nHis posts regularly get thousands of likes, but some of the more popular portraits are of Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, John Lennon, Lebron James, the cast of Fast & Furious, and The Notorious B.I.G, which he made on a wooden floor.\nBut its not just salt Ferrel works with. The young artist is so talented that he can produce breathtaking art out of pretty much anything. He runs a salon in San Antonio called Rob the Original Barbershop, where he gives customers crazy haircuts sculpted with logos, patterns, and celeb portraits.\nFerrel demonstrated his \"salt art\" during a television appearance on KRPC's Houston Life with hosts Derrick Shore and Courtney Zavala:",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a major discrepancy: the image depicts a painting of Jesus, not salt spilled to form an image.  The external check, while confirming the existence of the photograph, focuses on the false narrative surrounding it (a miraculous event).  The external check's confirmation of the photograph's existence doesn't negate the internal check's accurate observation that the caption misrepresents the image's content. The core disagreement lies in the interpretation of what constitutes 'out of context'. The internal check focuses on the direct misrepresentation of the image's content (painting vs. spilled salt), while the external check acknowledges the photograph's existence but deems the associated narrative false. Although the photograph exists, the caption's description of its creation ('salt spilled from a fallen shaker') is demonstrably inaccurate. The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from both checks, which, despite a slight difference in focus, converge on the conclusion that the caption is out of context because it inaccurately describes the image's contents.  The caption's error is not simply a matter of a misleading interpretation but a factual inaccuracy about the nature of the depicted image. Considering both assessments, a high confidence level is warranted in concluding the caption is out of context. The caption is out of context because the image does not contain spilled salt that forms an image of Jesus; instead it's a painting.  The external validation's focus on the false narrative surrounding the photo's origin doesn't override the fundamental inaccuracy of the caption’s description of the image's content.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly rejects the caption due to misrepresentation of image content. External check confirms photo existence but notes false narrative. Both checks indicate the caption is out of context, with high confidence due to independent evidence confirming the caption's inaccuracy."

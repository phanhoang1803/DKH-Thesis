        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes directly contradicts the news caption.  Snopes explicitly states that the video is real but miscaptioned; it shows a protest in Hong Kong in August 2019, predating the COVID-19 pandemic, and depicts the demolition of a smart lamppost, not a 5G tower.  The Snopes article details how the video was falsely connected to COVID-19 and 5G conspiracy theories.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims a video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower to stop the spread of COVID-19. Both internal and external validation processes strongly refute this claim.  The internal check reveals a low confidence score (7) because the video shows damage to telecommunications infrastructure in Hong Kong, not explicitly China, and lacks any visual connection to COVID-19.  Crucially, comments on the video dispute the identification of the structures as 5G towers.  The external check provides a high confidence score (10) based on a Snopes fact-check.  Snopes confirms the video's authenticity but highlights its miscaptioning. The video depicts a 2019 Hong Kong protest targeting surveillance towers, predating the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Snopes analysis demonstrates the video's false association with COVID-19 and 5G conspiracy theories. The alignment of both internal and external checks, both with high confidence, strongly indicates that the original caption is out of context.  There is no visual evidence supporting the claim of 5G tower destruction in China to combat COVID-19. The video depicts an entirely different event, wrongly interpreted and disseminated. The discrepancies are not due to ambiguities; instead, they result from deliberate misrepresentation and the spread of misinformation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly reject the original caption. Internal analysis finds the video's context inconsistent with the caption's claims regarding location (China vs. Hong Kong), timing (COVID-19 era vs. 2019), and the type of structure destroyed (5G tower vs. surveillance tower). External verification by Snopes definitively debunks the caption, confirming the video's unrelated context and the spread of misinformation."

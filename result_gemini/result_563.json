    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses uncertainty due to the absence of Kevin McCarthy in the image, despite the caption stating a meeting between Steve King and McCarthy. While the external check acknowledges the plausibility of such a meeting based on the individuals' political roles, the lack of visual evidence of McCarthy in the image significantly weakens the caption's accuracy. The internal check's low confidence score (3) and the absence of McCarthy in the image outweigh the external check's higher confidence score (8). Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because the image does not support the described meeting. The significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks highlights the importance of visual evidence for validating captions. Although the external check confirms the real-world existence of the individuals involved and the possibility of their meeting, the visual context is crucial for verifying the specific event described in the caption. A high degree of certainty requires both strong visual correlation and external factual validation.  In this case, the lack of visual evidence of McCarthy, a central figure in the caption's narrative, renders the caption out of context despite the external plausibility of a meeting between King and McCarthy.  The conflict emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to caption verification, integrating visual analysis with external knowledge validation. While external factors increase confidence in the identities of the people involved and the possibility of their interaction, the caption's context heavily relies on a specific visual contextâ€”McCarthy's presence at the meeting. This visual context is missing, creating a gap in our confidence. A more accurate caption would have to reflect the actual visual content or include more context to justify the stated meeting without the visual evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check expresses uncertainty due to the lack of Kevin McCarthy in the image, while the external check finds the meeting plausible but lacks definitive evidence.  The discrepancy results in a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

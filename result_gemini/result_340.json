        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show icebergs with multi-colored striping taken in Lake Michigan.\nOrigin\nAlthough the version of these photographs originally circulated via e-mail back in March 2008 correctly identified their origins, variants from early 2010, 2011, and 2014 presented the icebergs pictured above as a phenomenon encountered in Lake Michigan, thereby erroneously placing them many thousands of miles away (and in the wrong hemisphere) from their true source. (These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check identifies a significant mismatch between the image (showing a large iceberg) and the caption's claim (Lake Michigan, which does not have large icebergs).  The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete lack of alignment. The external check corroborates this finding, citing a source that explicitly debunks the false attribution of these icebergs to Lake Michigan.  The high confidence score of 10 for the external check stems from the direct and unambiguous evidence provided by the source, which clearly states that the icebergs were actually photographed near Cape Town, South Africa, refuting the caption's claim completely. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both independently and convincingly demonstrate that the caption is incorrect and misleading.  The high overall confidence score of 10 reflects the strong and consistent evidence from both validation methods, confirming that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image shows large icebergs, which is inconsistent with the characteristics of Lake Michigan. An external source directly contradicts the caption's claim, correctly identifying the location of the icebergs as near Cape Town, South Africa."

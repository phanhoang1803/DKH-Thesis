        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Donald Trumps inaugural committee spent more than $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the nations capital as part of a scheme to grossly overpay for party space and enrich the presidents own family in the process, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\nThe District of Columbias attorney general, Karl Racine, said the committee misused nonprofit funds and coordinated with the hotels management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. He said one of the events planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, the presidents daughter Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates, a top campaign official at the time.\nDistrict law requires nonprofits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies, Racine said. In this case, we are seeking to recover the nonprofit funds that were improperly funneled directly to the Trump family business.\nIt was the latest allegation that Trump and his family have used public and nonprofit funds spent at Trump-owned properties to enrich themselves  part of the peril of Trump not fully withdrawing from his businesses while he is president. Trump has maintained ownership but turned the reins over to his adult sons, who have bristled at the charge that they are profiting off their fathers presidency.\nThe committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trumps inauguration in January 2017. But the committees spending has drawn mounting scrutiny.\nThe inaugural committee said Wednesday that it cooperated with the investigation and that Racines office hadnt contacted its lawyers to interview any employees. A spokesman for the committee also said the group had not been contacted by the attorney generals office since last summer and suggested the timing of the suit was politically motivated, as the Senate impeachment trial of the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress was underway.\nThe facts will show that the PIC operated in compliance with the law and this suit is without merit. In fact, it reads more like a partisan press release than a legal filing, according to a committee statement.\nProsecutors found that Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who flipped on the president during the special counsels Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms. In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was a bit worried about the optics of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said.\nStephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump who played a leading role organizing the inaugural parties, had also told Trump, when he was president-elect, and Ivanka Trump that she was uneasy with the offer, Racine said. Winston Wolkoff later followed up with an email to Gates and Ivanka Trump warning that the hotels proposal was at least twice the market rate, Racine said.\nBut Gates went through with it anyway, at a cost of $1.03 million, the suit says.\nProsecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didnt consider those options.\nGates pleaded guilty to charges tied to his lucrative political consulting work in Ukraine and was sentenced last month to 45 days in prison, a punishment that a judge said reflected the extensive cooperation Gates had provided to the Justice Department. Racines office said investigators did not directly speak with Gates in as they pursued the suit.\nA lawyer who represented Gates for the criminal proceedings didnt immediately return a message seeking comment. The White House didnt immediately return a message nor did the Trump Organization.\nThe suit contends that the hotel went against industry practice and refused to discount the space, and double-booked its largest ballroom with a different organization that was still affiliated with the inauguration, the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast. Both organizations were nonprofits, but the breakfast paid $5,000 for the ballroom. The committee, however, paid $175,000, the suit claims.\nProsecutors say the committee also used nonprofit funds to throw a private party on Jan. 20 2017, the night of the inauguration, for Trumps family  a $300,000 affair. The reception was for three of Trumps children  Donald, Jr., Ivanka and Eric.\nThere will be an after party at the OPO (Trump Hotel) following the inaugural balls on Friday. DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric, Gates wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump, according to the suit. DJT is a reference to Donald J. Trump.\nEvent staff within the inaugural committee recognized this would not be a proper use of committee funds and had tried to cancel this event, according to the suit, but Gates and the Trump family went ahead anyway.\nRacine said his office focused on the inaugural committee and the companies that profited because investigators believe thats the best option for them to possibly recover the funds.\nRacine had been sending subpoenas for months related to the investigation. The inaugural committee was also being investigated by New York and state authorities in New Jersey, who are looking into, among other things, whether foreigners illegally contributed to the inaugural events.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the inauguration was held on Jan. 20, 2017.",

While the exact figure in the caption ($1.5 million) isn't precisely matched, the evidence strongly supports the claim that a significant amount exceeding $1 million was billed.

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (10) that the caption is aligned with the image content because the image depicts the Trump International Hotel, which is the central subject of the caption. The external check also reveals high confidence (8) in the factual accuracy of the caption, indicating the Trump International Hotel billed the inaugural committee more than $1 million, supporting the core assertion of the caption. There's a minor discrepancy in the exact billing amount; however, the external source strongly suggests a significant amount exceeding $1 million. Considering both checks display high confidence and corroborate the claim with only a minor discrepancy in exact amounts, the caption is deemed to be in context. The high confidence score reflects the strong internal and external evidence supporting the accuracy of the caption's main point, despite a small numerical discrepancy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy, with high confidence scores. A minor discrepancy in the exact billing amount exists, but the overall claim remains strongly supported by evidence."

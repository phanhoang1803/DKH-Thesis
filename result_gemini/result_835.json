        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a real trampoline bridge in Paris.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nPhotographs purportedly showing a \"trampoline bridge\" in Paris have been circulating on the internet since at least 2012. While these photographs are frequently shared along with the claim that they show a real structure, these are concept images that were originally created for an architecture competition:\nThe program challenges participants to design a New Contemporary Bridge over the Seine River in Paris. The new Bridge should create a new Icon or landmark in Paris, considering that there are approximately 37 Bridges over the Seine. The design should take into account the position of the location and the expectation for Iconic bridge in a city like Paris.\nThe design firm Atelier Zndel Cristea (AZC) was awarded third place for their bouncing bridge design. While this bridge was never constructed over the Seine River, AZC described the concept on their web site:\nSaut de Seine is an inflatable bridge equipped with giant trampolines, dedicated to the joyful release from gravity as one bounces above the river. Installed near the Bir-Hakeim Bridge, the Saut de Seine Bridge is formed of inflatable modules, like giant life-preservers, 30 meters in diameter. In the central part of each ring, a trampoline mesh is stretched. The floating buoys, fabricated in PVC membrane, are attached together by cord to form a stable and self-supporting ensemble. Each module under tension, about 30m diameter - filled with 3700 cubic meters of air - develops in space with an arch-like form. Le total length of the bridge is about 94m. The Saut de Seine allows every visitor a novel view of Paris from his or her own unique spatial position: upright and leaping, upside down and tumbling, gliding above like a circus performer The installation is located in direct relationship to Eiffels tower, itself a symbol of ephemeral architecture designed to provide a unique experience: a view of all of Paris. We think the superposition of these two works reveals a specific kind of architecture: one designed to install an experience of happiness in the city.\nIt's not completely unprecedented, though. AZC did build a smaller model of the bouncing bridge in 2014. The prototype was about a third of the conceptualized size (about 10m in diameter) and was temporarily installed on the Lake of Banyoles:\nThis project was developed for a competition which topic was to design a contemporary bridge in Paris. As the opportunity presented itself, we chose to design a bridge of a new kind. A bridge that would allow amazing uses and surprising sensations. Why not conceive a temporary bridge? A bridge that could take part of a summer event such as \"Paris Plage\". It would allow sensational amusement and release our deepest emotions. We imagined the Bouncing Bridge!\n[...]\nWe designed a model of 10 m diameter, about a third of the original dimension, in order to test its performances. The main material of the module is a membrane made of reinforced PVC. To reproduce the complex shape of the curve, the Bridge was modeled digitally, and decomposed in different fragments. This method allowed to cut all the elements by a computerized machine. Then all the elements were assembled by thermal weld.\nThe idea of a permanent bouncing bridge is intriguing, but would probably be impractical (especially during winter months).",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption, \"Photographs show a real trampoline bridge in Paris,\" is inaccurate. The internal check identifies a discrepancy between the caption's claim of photographs showing a real structure and the image's depiction of a design rendering, giving a confidence score of 8.  The external check provides corroborating evidence, stating that the images are from an architectural competition and represent a concept design that was never realized beyond a small temporary model in a different location. This external validation gives a confidence score of 10.  The high confidence scores from both checks, combined with the consistent finding of inaccuracy, lead to a strong conclusion that the caption is out of context. The discrepancy between the caption's assertion of real photographs and the actual nature of the images (design renderings) is significant and undeniable.  The external check directly refutes the claim of a real, existing bridge, offering substantial supporting evidence from credible sources. Therefore, the statement is definitively out of context. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; instead, they complement each other in reaching the same conclusion.  The entity analysis (Paris, trampoline bridge, photographs/renderings) further reinforces the finding. The caption incorrectly states the existence of real photographs of a completed structure when the available evidence shows only renderings of a proposed design that was never fully implemented.  This inaccuracy is not minor; it misrepresents the nature of the structure depicted and leads to a false understanding.  The external validation provides clear supporting points, confirming the inaccuracy and emphasizing that this is not simply a minor descriptive detail but a fundamental factual error.  In summary, the evidence strongly supports the judgment that the caption is out of context and misrepresents the actual status of the project depicted in the images. The high confidence scores from both internal and external verification methods unequivocally support this assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly reject the caption's claim, indicating that the images are design renderings, not photographs of a real structure, and the proposed bridge was never built.  High confidence scores (8 and 10) from both checks demonstrate the caption's inaccuracy."

      "explanation": "Based on general knowledge of how Congress operates and the role of a Treasury Secretary, it is plausible that House Democrats would call for testimony from the Treasury Secretary.  However, without access to real-time congressional schedules and announcements, verification is needed to confirm the specific date and whether the request was actually made and responded to.  The plausibility stems from the common practice of congressional oversight over executive branch officials.  Therefore, it is likely true, but not verifiable without external confirmation.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the alignment between the image (showing Steven Mnuchin) and the caption's mention of him. However, the external check, while also positive (confidence 8), highlights the lack of verifiable evidence to confirm the specific claim of House Democrats calling for Mnuchin's testimony on that particular Thursday. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of such a request based on general knowledge of Congressional procedures but stresses the need for external confirmation.  The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty: the internal check focuses solely on the image and caption's alignment, while the external check considers the broader context and the need for factual verification. Because the external check focuses on the verifiability of the claim itself, which is uncertain without access to official records, it tempers the confidence score. Although the image strongly suggests Mnuchin is the subject, the caption's claim lacks independent corroboration.  To reach a final verdict, a balanced approach is taken. The high confidence of the internal check is considered alongside the necessary caution from the external check, which brings the overall confidence level to 8. This is because while the image and caption align, the specific claim about a Congressional request remains unsubstantiated.  A higher confidence score would be justified only if independent sources confirmed the House Democrats' call for testimony on that specific date.  Therefore, the final judgment is OOC is True due to the lack of external corroboration, even though the plausibility of the event is quite high.  The image is internally consistent with the image content; the main issue is whether the claim in the caption is verified in reality.  The image is merely of Mnuchin; the caption introduces additional context of a Congressional request and a specific date, which remains unsubstantiated.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows strong alignment between image and caption entities (confidence 10). External check points to lack of verifiable evidence for the specific claim of Congressional testimony on a given date (confidence 8).  The final verdict is based on the external check's emphasis on verification, leading to a lower overall confidence score while acknowledging the plausibility of the situation."

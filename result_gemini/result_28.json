      "explanation": "Promobot is a real company known for producing humanoid robots.  The development of hyper-realistic skin for robots is a plausible advancement in robotics.  Vladivostok is a real city in Russia. Therefore, the core elements of the caption are consistent with known facts. However, without specific sources confirming Promobot's activities in Vladivostok regarding hyperrealistic skin, the claim remains partially unverifiable.  The confidence score is adjusted to reflect this uncertainty.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both agree that the caption is likely inaccurate, despite some elements being factually correct. The image depicts a hyperrealistic skin mask, which aligns with the caption's mention of \"hyper-realistic skin.\"  The external check successfully verifies Promobot's existence and the plausibility of developing such technology.  However, neither the internal nor external checks can confirm whether the mask in the image is specifically being developed by Promobot in Vladivostok. The image lacks any identifying markers that would link it definitively to Promobot or Vladivostok. Therefore, while the individual components (hyperrealistic skin, Promobot, Vladivostok) are verifiable, the assertion that Promobot is developing this specific mask in Vladivostok is unsupported by the image or readily available evidence. The image's context is insufficient to confirm the entire caption, leading to a conclusion of 'out of context'.  The confidence score remains at 8 because, while the caption is deemed OOC, some parts are indeed factually correct and plausible. This uncertainty is reflected in the lower-than-maximum confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the image's context does not sufficiently support the claim that the shown mask is being developed by Promobot in Vladivostok, despite the individual components being verifiable.  The core elements of the caption are not outlandish but lack confirmation."

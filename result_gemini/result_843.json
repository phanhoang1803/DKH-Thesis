        "content": "Claim:\nPhotographs show a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.\nAs a polar vortex caused temperatures to plummet in many areas of the North America in January 2019, a set of cute photographs purportedly showing a bird (variously described as a goose or a duck) helping to keep a puppy warm circulated on social media. The most popular posting of these photographs (which garnered more than 235,000 shares within a week) was accompanied by a brief piece of text supposedly explaining the back story of the images:\nA man finds a goose that was shaking with cold stuck to a pole in Montana. When approaching, the surprise is capital. The goose was sheltering with her wings a puppy that was about to die frozen.\nWe have so much to learn as a species ...\nThese images appear to be real. However, they weren't taken recently, we've found no evidence that either animal was \"stuck to a pole,\" and we're skeptical that these photographs were snapped in Montana (or anywhere in the United States).\nThese photographs have been circulating on Chinese social media sites and news platforms, such as Weibo and Toutiao, since 2017. The earliest posting that we could uncover came from March of 2017 in a blog post on the Chinese news platform NetEase.\nThe accompanying story (roughly translated via Google) relayed a similar message to the viral Facebook post. According to NetEase, the dog was shivering on the side of the road when it was by encountered a group of ducks. The mother duck then put the pup under its arms in order to keep it warm:\nThe puppy was shivering coldly on the side of the road. Even the passing ducks couldnt see it. But one puppy ran straight at the puppy and hugged it to keep it warm.\nWhen the dog was hugged by the duck, it did not struggle and was safely taken in the duck's arms. It can be seen that the ducks have more love, and that mother love is great.\nIn the care of the mother duck, the puppy no longer has to be afraid of being cold, and only this kind of particularly caring duck mother will do this. The average animal will not be like this for children who are not their own.\nA note at the bottom of this story states that NetEase allows users to post their own content, and that the story solely represents the words of the author. In other words, no verification process takes place.\nThe story published to Netease didn't provide many specifics about the photographs (such as where they were taken), and we haven't been able to find any previous reports about them. While we can't say for sure what these pictures capture, they have been circulating online on Chinese social media sites since at least 2017 and were most likely taken somewhere in that country. The superfluous claim about the duck's being \"stuck to a post\" was added after the fact and appears to have been invented in an attempt to raise the stakes (and shareability) of this content.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the photographs depict a bird warming a frozen puppy in Montana.  Internal validation finds this claim implausible because the images themselves show a goose sheltering a dog, but there's no visual evidence suggesting the dog is frozen or that the location is Montana. The internal check's low confidence score (0) reflects this lack of corroborating evidence within the images. \n\nExternal validation, however, provides strong evidence contradicting the original caption.  The external check (confidence score of 8) cites Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, which verifies that the images are real but challenges the narrative accompanying them.  Snopes states the story about Montana and the frozen puppy is suspect, and that the images have circulated online since at least 2017, originating from Chinese social media platforms.  The Montana location was added later, implying the original caption is a misattribution or a fabricated addition to the existing images.\n\nThe discrepancy between the internal and external checks is easily resolved: the internal check assesses only the visual content of the photographs, while the external check investigates the broader context surrounding their online distribution and associated narratives.  The external check, leveraging credible sources like Snopes, provides a more comprehensive and trustworthy assessment of the caption's accuracy.\n\nTherefore, both internal and external validation independently and decisively refute the claim in the original caption. The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong agreement between the checks and the reliability of the evidence, primarily from Snopes.  The external validation, with its factual basis and reference to a respected fact-checking website, carries significantly more weight than the internal check's visual assessment alone.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly refute the original caption. Internal validation finds no visual evidence supporting the claim, while external validation cites Snopes to show that the Montana and frozen puppy narrative is added misinformation."

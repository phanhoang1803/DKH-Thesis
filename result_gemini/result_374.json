      "explanation": "While the exact nature of their relationship is debated, it's widely acknowledged that Kamala Harris and Willie Brown had a close relationship when she was in her 30s and he was Mayor of San Francisco.  Brown has publicly discussed their relationship, though the specific details are not uniformly described as an \"extramarital affair\" across all sources. The lack of precise details makes the exact nature of their relationship difficult to fully verify but doesn't negate the reports of their past relationship.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch between the image and the caption. The image shows Kamala Harris waving to a crowd; it contains no information about an extramarital affair. The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this accurate assessment. The external check acknowledges that Kamala Harris and Willie Brown had a close relationship when Harris was in her 30s and Brown was Mayor of San Francisco.  However, the external check's description of their relationship as an \"extramarital affair\" is not universally supported across all sources and thus is not definitively verifiable from the available information.  The external check assigns a confidence score of 8, which is quite high, but this score reflects the widespread acknowledgment of their close relationship, not the explicit verification of the \"extramarital affair\" aspect. The discrepancy arises from the difference between the factual existence of a relationship and the subjective and varying descriptions of its nature.  The external check's assessment focuses on the confirmed relationship, while the claim of an \"extramarital affair\" lacks the same level of conclusive evidence. Overall, while a past relationship between Harris and Brown is confirmed, labeling it as an \"extramarital affair\" is not sufficiently supported by widely available evidence. Therefore, considering both checks, the caption is deemed out of context because the image provides no evidence of an affair, and the external validation highlights the uncertainty surrounding the exact nature of their relationship, with the label \"extramarital affair\" being less definitively supported.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found no evidence of an extramarital affair in the image (confidence: 0). External check confirmed a past relationship but found varying descriptions of its nature, with the 'extramarital affair' claim not fully verifiable (confidence: 8). The discrepancy lies in the unverified label 'extramarital affair', leading to an OOC conclusion."

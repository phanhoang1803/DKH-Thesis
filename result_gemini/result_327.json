      "explanation": "The image shows three police officers in Met Police uniforms placing flowers at a memorial.  The caption mentions an investigation into the murder of a Met officer at a police station, which is consistent with the visual of officers paying respects at what seems to be a police station. The visual evidence strongly supports the caption's mention of the Met Police.",

      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Police officers are sometimes murdered, and it is possible for a murder to take place at a police station, although it's statistically rare.  The lack of specifics makes it difficult to definitively assess the truth.  Investigations into murders are common occurrences. Therefore, the caption does not contain elements that are inherently implausible. However, further details would be needed for verification.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's alignment with the image context. The internal check has a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows three police officers in Metropolitan Police uniforms placing flowers at a location that appears to be a police station. This aligns perfectly with the caption's description of an investigation into the murder of a Met officer at a police station.  The officers' solemn expressions and the presence of flowers suggest a memorial for a fallen colleague. The visual evidence strongly supports the narrative of a death and subsequent investigation.\n\nThe external check also yields a high confidence score (8), acknowledging that while the specific details of the murder are not provided in the image or caption, the general scenario presented is plausible. Police officers can be murdered, and such incidents could occur at police stations, even though they are statistically less common than in other locations. The caption doesn't present anything implausible; investigations into murders are common and expected in such circumstances. The external check correctly points out the lack of specifics as a limitation for complete verification but doesn't indicate any contradiction with the caption.\n\nThere is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both confirm the plausibility of the caption based on the image. The external check's slightly lower confidence score reflects the lack of specific details to confirm beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas the internal check emphasizes the strong visual correlation. This difference is not a contradiction but a nuance in the verification approach. The image's focus on the memorial and grieving officers strongly suggests the caption accurately reflects the recent event and its ongoing investigation. While more information would enhance confirmation, the available evidence overwhelmingly suggests a strong correspondence between the caption and the image content.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption.  The image visually aligns well with the caption's description of a murder investigation of a Met officer at a police station. While the external check notes a lack of specific details limiting complete verification, it doesn't find anything implausible.  Overall, the caption is highly likely to be accurate."

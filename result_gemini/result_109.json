        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a cruise ship dumping human waste near a coastal city.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image supposedly showing a cruise ship dumping human waste into the ocean near a coastal city is frequently shared on social media. One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but its ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations, he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, theres a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe grey water from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the black water lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated, according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes indicates that the image is miscaptioned. While the image shows a cruise ship and dark clouds in the water near a coastal city, the evidence explicitly states that the clouds are sand and mud churned up by the ship's turbines, not human waste.  Therefore, the news caption is inaccurate.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is inaccurate. The internal check, with a confidence score of 3, notes a lack of visual evidence in the image to support the claim of human waste dumping.  The explanation points out that the image shows a cruise ship near a plume in the water, but this is not definitively human waste. The external check, with a confidence score of 2, provides strong evidence from Snopes that the image is miscaptioned.  It explains that the dark clouds in the water are sand and mud churned up by the ship's turbines as it dropped anchor, not human waste. This explanation is supported by details about the location (Punta del Este, Uruguay) and the actions of the ship before the picture was taken. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently arrive at the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate.  The higher confidence score of 9 reflects the combined weight of both checks and the corroborating information provided by the external source, which adds substantial contextual information about the image. The high confidence level stems from the lack of visual proof of human waste dumping in the image (internal check) and the explicit refutation of the caption from a reliable source (external check), supported by a plausible alternative explanation for the plume in the water.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm the caption is out of context.  The image shows a cruise ship near a sediment plume, but there's no visual evidence of waste dumping. External evidence from Snopes clarifies that the plume is sand and mud, not human waste."

While it's possible for such an event to occur, the lack of evidence and the source's questionable credibility make the claim highly improbable.  The timeline (early February 2021) and the individuals mentioned (DeSantis and Biden) are verifiable, but the specific interaction is unverifiable and lacks corroboration from reliable news sources.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies Ron DeSantis in the image, aligning with the caption's mention of him. However, it acknowledges the absence of Joe Biden or any visual evidence of the interaction described.  The external check focuses on the source of the claim—Real Raw News—a website known for publishing false and unsubstantiated stories. This casts significant doubt on the claim's validity.  Although the caption correctly identifies DeSantis and Biden and places the event within a verifiable timeframe,  the lack of corroboration from reputable news sources and the source's history of misinformation outweigh the internal consistency.  The high confidence score (8) in the external check stems from the well-documented unreliability of Real Raw News and the absence of any evidence to support the claim. The discrepancy lies in the scope of the checks: the internal check assesses only image-caption alignment, while the external check evaluates the credibility of the underlying news claim. To reconcile this, we consider that while the image shows DeSantis, the caption's main assertion—the interaction with Biden—rests entirely on a source widely known for fabricating news. Therefore, despite the image's internal consistency, the lack of external corroboration and the highly questionable source significantly reduce the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy.  The claim is highly improbable, even if the entities mentioned are real and held the stated positions at the given time.  The validation prioritizes the external check's findings on the credibility of the source, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There is no independent verification supporting the interaction between DeSantis and Biden as reported by Real Raw News. The context is considered out of context because of the verifiable unreliability of the source, not because the individuals or their positions are fake. The image is of DeSantis, but the claim of interaction with Biden is entirely based on a disreputable source. Therefore, the lack of trustworthy corroboration leads to a high confidence score of 8 for the OOC judgment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms DeSantis' presence in the image; however, the external check reveals the claim's source (Real Raw News) is unreliable, lacking evidence, and widely known for misinformation.  Despite internal consistency, the external validation strongly suggests the caption is out of context."

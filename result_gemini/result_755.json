Myself and thousands of others remember watching this movie, but apparently it was never made.\nI've tried looking it up myself and haven't found anything about it. There is an article about the oddity that was on Facebook. Someone commented a screenshot of the vhs in the comments, but again, I could not find this picture on the internet myself.\nAlthough this movie does not actually exist, social media users have circulated an image in an attempt to fool viewers into believing the film is real:\nThe \"genie\" in the above-displayed image actually features the chest and arms of WWE wrestler Chavo Guerrero, with Sinbad's face digitally added to the scene:\nDespite the total lack of evidence that any such film starring Sinbad was ever made  no extant footage, no still shots documenting its creation, no news articles or movie reviews mentioning it, it has no entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and Sinbad himself has stated that he never played a genie in a movie called Shazaam  many people still they remember seeing the movie.\nBut why?\nWhile we cannot pinpoint an exact origin of this collective false memory, several circumstantial aspects suggest why people may mistakenly recall Sinbad's having starred in a genie movie.\nThe name: Depending on when you grew up, the name \"Sinbad\" likely recalls memories of one of two things: either a popular 1990s comedian, or a fictional sailor who had adventures (sometimes involving genies) in the Middle East. It is possible that some viewers have conflated the two characters in recalling a 1990s-era film about a genie.\nSinbad himself did once host a showing of the movie \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\" on TNT in 1994:\nKazaam: A simpler explanation is that some fans are misremembering the details of another movie from the 1990s that featured a popular actor playing a genie. In 1996, Shaquille O'Neal essayed the role of a genie in the film \"Kazaam\":\nSinbad appeared in several popular childrens' movies in the 1990s, so it would not be particularly surprising if some viewers mistakenly remembered him in this particular genie film (which, naturally, would not go unnoticed by Internet pranksters). In fact, a preview for Kazaam was reportedly featured during the previews on some VHS copies of the Sinbad movie The First Kid:\nIt appears that this Sinbad-genie phenomenon is another instance of the \"Mandela Effect,\" an informal term for a collective false memory. The term was coined by a woman who discovered that she and hundreds of other people believed, and remembered, that Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s. Mandela actually died in 2013, after serving as South Africa's first black president and winning the Nobel Peace Prize (along with another former president, Frederik Willem de Klerk, who ended the system of segregation known in South Africa as apartheid during his time in power) in 1993  all of which, of course, would have been impossible if Mandela had been dead for a decade.\nSightings:",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The image depicts comedian Sinbad, and the caption mentions Sinbad in relation to a movie. However, the external check provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim. The external check's high confidence score stems from Snopes.com's detailed investigation debunking the existence of a 1990s movie \"Shazaam\" starring Sinbad. This discrepancy necessitates a thorough analysis. The internal check relies solely on visual recognition and common knowledge about Sinbad, while the external check uses factual verification from a reliable source.  Given the high confidence of the external check and the lack of any supporting evidence to corroborate the existence of \"Shazaam\", we must prioritize the external evidence. The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the external check, as it leverages robust fact-checking and evidence-based analysis, which far surpasses the limitations of visual interpretation alone.The internal assessment's strength is its immediate recognition of Sinbad, aligning with the image. Nevertheless, this visual confirmation is inadequate to substantiate the claim of a specific movie. While the image provides contextual support for Sinbad's identity, it lacks sufficient data to verify the film's existence. Therefore, given the overwhelming evidence from the external check and its high confidence score, we conclude the caption is out of context. The external validation's high confidence is rooted in the Snopes article's methodology and established credibility.The internal check, while confident in visual identification, cannot validate the existence of a movie. In contrast, the external check directly addresses the movie's existence.The resolution of the disagreement hinges on the weight of evidence. A visual assessment is inadequate to counter evidence-based fact-checking. Therefore, we conclude the caption is definitively out of context based on the robust evidence presented by the external check.",

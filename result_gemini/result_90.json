        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a driver evading police by bouncing the car off the roofs of two vehicles.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOrigin\nIn April 2021, a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed someone evading police in a car by jumping the vehicle off a ramp, bouncing off the tops of of a semi-truck and a bus that were driving by, then landing on the other side of the road and driving away.\nAt the time of this writing, this video had been viewed more than 4.7 million times. This footage, however, does not capture a real car chase but computer generated images.\nIt was created by a 3D artist who uses the handle @2NCS on social media. When this video was posted to the artist's Instagram page, it was accompanied by hashtags such as #3d and #animation to indicate that this was a CGI video, not a genuine piece of footage.\n@2NCS identified himself on his website as a 23-year-old named Dionisis who lives in the United Kingdom: \"My name is Dionisis and I'm 23 years old. I live in UK. For me working as a car designer was a life goal. My motivation stems from the possibility that 3d graphics offer me, turning my imagination into reality. CGI is a great art that changed the way I express myself.\" Dinosis added that he uses the software programs Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe After Effects to create his videos.\n@2NCS has had a few other videos go viral after internet users incorrectly assumed that they were real. In 2019, for example, a video that supposedly showed a Lamborghini evading police by sliding underneath a truck racked up more than 10 million views.\nHere's a look at how that viral video was made:",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check reveals a mismatch between the caption's description of the car bouncing off vehicle roofs and the actual video content, which shows the car driving over a small dip. This internal check gives a confidence score of 8.  The external check, using Snopes.com as a source, definitively confirms that the video is computer-generated imagery (CGI), not a real event. This completely refutes the caption's claim of a police evasion maneuver involving car-roof bounces.  The external check provides a confidence score of 10. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and conclusively demonstrate that the caption inaccurately describes the video.  The high confidence scores from both checks (8 and 10) reinforce the conclusion.  The discrepancies are significant: the caption misrepresents the nature of the car's movement (no roof bounces) and the very reality of the depicted event (CGI, not a real-life incident).  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation decisively confirm that the caption is out of context. The internal analysis highlights discrepancies between the caption and video content, while external fact-checking confirms the video is CGI, completely invalidating the caption's claim."

        "content": "Claim:\nA line from George Orwell's novel 1984 predicts the power of smartphones.\nIn June 2017, a quote, purportedly taken from George Orwell's novel 1984, spread widely online, forming the basis for several memes that presented it as a remarkable prediction of the power and ubiquitousness of smartphones.\nReviewing Robert Icke and Duncan MacMillan's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2017, the Australian news web site News.com called it a \"quote from the production\" and added:\nThe line is from one of the characters that works for the Government, otherwise known as Big Brother. He says: The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice whats happening.\nAnd in its review of the play, which came to New York's Broadway in July 2017, the Spectrum News NY1 TV channel also highlighted the quotation:\nPerhaps most terrifying of all is hearing O'Brien seeming to predict our current state of apathy, saying, \"The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what's happening.\" In 2017, \"1984\" resonates louder than ever.\nWhat neither of these reviews make clear, and what the many memes get wrong, is that these words weren't written by George Orwell in 1949, and do not appear in the novel 1984.\nDespite a thorough search of the 2016 Enrich Spot e-book edition of 1984, we were unable to find these lines in the original novel. However, they resemble a speech from the book, made by O'Brien, a member of \"the Party\" who works at the Ministry of Truth:\nThe proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.\nAt another point in the original novel, the protagonist Winston notes: \"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.\"\nThe earliest iteration of the quotation on Twitter dates to July 2014, during the play's second run at the Playhouse Theatre in London. (It was first staged in 2013). During the same run, a second tweet attributes the lines to the stage adaptation. However, soon afterwards, the quote began to be falsely attributed to the 1949 novel, rather than the 2014 theater adaptation.\nThe revival of the play in Australia and then New York during the summer of 2017 has led to a resurgence in social media posts and memes falsely attributing the line to George Orwell's 68-year-old novel.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds that the image shows a portrait of George Orwell and some biographical information, but it lacks any textual evidence from *1984* to support the caption's claim about a prediction regarding smartphones.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the high certainty of this assessment.  The external check provides further evidence by referencing Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, which debunks the claim.  Snopes's explanation confirms that the quote attributed to *1984* actually originated from a 2014 stage adaptation of the novel, not the original text. Again, a confidence score of 10 reflects the strong support provided by this external verification.  The high confidence scores from both checks align perfectly, indicating a robust consensus that the caption is indeed out of context.  There are no discrepancies or conflicting information to resolve.  The entity analysis corroborates these findings; while the image correctly identifies George Orwell, it does not depict anything from *1984* related to smartphone use.  In summary, all available evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context, making the confidence score of 10 fully justified.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The internal check confirms the absence of supporting evidence within the image, while the external check cites Snopes's debunking of the claim.  There are no discrepancies between the checks."

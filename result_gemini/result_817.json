      "explanation": "The image contains a sign that mentions \"DEFUND SPD\", which is related to the Seattle protest and could be associated with antifa. However, there is no visual evidence of a performer in a revealing black netting outfit. Therefore, only the entity \"Seattle\" is clearly represented in the image.",

      "explanation": "While the presence of antifa activists in Seattle protests is plausible given their historical involvement in such events, the connection between a performer in a revealing outfit and anti-fascist activism is tenuous and requires further verification.  The caption lacks specific details about the protest and the performer's role, making it difficult to assess the claim's validity. The description is vague enough that it could be true or false, hence the low confidence score.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The original caption claims a performer in a revealing black netting outfit was among anti-fascist activists in the Seattle protest.  The internal check found no evidence of such a performer in the provided image; the image focuses on protest signs and the environment. The internal check's confidence score was low (8) due to the lack of visual evidence supporting the performer's presence. The external check also cast doubt on the caption's accuracy, citing the weak link between a revealing outfit and anti-fascist activism and lack of further verifiable details. Its confidence score was also low (4).  Both checks show low confidence and align in their assessment that the caption is out of context.  The discrepancy lies in the emphasis—the internal check focuses on the image's lack of visual proof of the performer, while the external check questions the entire narrative's plausibility.  However, both analyses converge on the conclusion that the caption is not supported by evidence.  Therefore, the final verdict is \"OOC: True\" with a confidence score of 4, reflecting the low confidence levels of both checks and the vagueness of the original caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks deem the caption out of context.  The internal check focuses on the lack of visual evidence for the described performer, while the external check questions the overall narrative's plausibility. Low confidence scores from both checks reinforce the conclusion that the caption is unsupported by available evidence."

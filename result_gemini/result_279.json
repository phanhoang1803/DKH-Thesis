        "content": "Claim:\nEggs shouldn't be refrigerated in the United States.\nIn March 2021, a colorful advertisement appeared on websites that displayed ads from the Taboola advertising network. The text of the ad read: \"35 Foods That Should Never Be Placed in the Refrigerator.\" It showed a picture of eggs in a refrigerator overlaid with a large, red \"X.\" This seemed to imply that eggs shouldn't be refrigerated.\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a 35-page slideshow article. It mentioned 35 products that supposedly shouldn't be refrigerated.\nHowever, eggs never showed up in the story. The ad was nothing but clickbait.\nThe Dr. Health Magazine website did not list any medical professionals on its staff. The copyright date in the footer of the story was last updated in 2017. It did not appear to be a trustworthy source of information regarding health and well-being.\nShould Eggs Be Refrigerated?\nIn 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a rule to egg handlers. The announcement read as follows on the FDA website:\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a regulation expected to prevent each year approximately 79,000 cases of foodborne illness and 30 deaths caused by consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella Enteritidis.\nThe regulation requires preventive measures during the production of eggs in poultry houses and requires subsequent refrigeration during storage and transportation.\nEgg-associated illness caused by Salmonella is a serious public health problem. Infected individuals may suffer mild to severe gastrointestinal illness, short-term or chronic arthritis, or even death. Implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of Salmonella Enteritidis infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent.\nThe rule requires that measures designed to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis be adopted by virtually all egg producers with 3,000 or more laying hens whose shell eggs are not processed with a treatment, such as pasteurization, to ensure their safety.\nThe FDA also advised that eggs should be stored \"promptly in a clean refrigerator at a temperature of 40 F or below.\"\nAccording to The New York Times, the reason some other countries don't advise citizens to refrigerate eggs comes down to one thing: In the U.S., many eggs are washed at egg-production facilities to ward off salmonella concerns:\nWashing the eggs also cleans off a thin, protective cuticle devised by nature to protect bacteria from getting inside the egg in the first place. (The cuticle also helps keep moisture in the egg.)\nWith the cuticle gone, it is essential  and, in the United States, the law  that eggs stay chilled from the moment they are washed until you are ready to cook them. Japan also standardized a system of egg washing and refrigeration after a serious salmonella outbreak in the 1990s.\nIn sum, Dr. Health Magazine appeared to mislead readers by using a picture of eggs in its advertisement. The FDA has strongly advised that people living in the United States should keep their eggs refrigerated.",

        "content": "Go in search of eggs in most foreign countries and you might encounter a strange scene: eggs on a shelf or out in the open air, nowhere near a refrigerator.\nShock and confusion may ensue. What are they doing there? And are they safe to eat?\nWe Americans, along with the Japanese, Australians and Scandinavians, tend to be squeamish about our chicken eggs, so we bathe them and then have to refrigerate them.\nBut we're oddballs. Most other countries don't mind letting unwashed eggs sit next to bread or onions.\nThe difference boils down to two key things: how to go after bacteria that could contaminate them, and how much energy we're willing to use in the name of safe eggs.\nTo understand when the rift happened, let's rewind. About a hundred years ago, many people around the world washed their eggs. But there are a lot of ways to do it wrong, so the method got a bad reputation in certain parts of the world. A batch of rotten eggs, which had been washed in Australia, left a bad impression on its British importers.\nBy 1970, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had perfected the art of the wash with the help of fancy machines, and it required all egg producers to do it. Meanwhile, many European countries were prohibiting washing, and Asian countries never got on board with it. The exception was Japan, which joined the egg-washers after a bad spate of salmonella in the 1990s.\nSo what's the deal with washing and refrigeration? Soon after eggs pop out of the chicken, American producers put them straight to a machine that shampoos them with soap and hot water. The steamy shower leaves the shells squeaky clean. But it also compromises them, by washing away a barely visible sheen that naturally envelops each egg.\n\"The egg is a marvel in terms of protecting itself, and one of the protections is this coating, which prevents them from being porous,\" says food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of Egg: A Culinary Exploration of the World's Most Versatile Ingredient.\nThe coating is like a little safety vest for the egg, keeping water and oxygen in and bad bacteria out. Washing can damage that layer and \"increase the chances for bacterial invasion\" into pores or hairline cracks in the shell, according to Yi Chen, a food scientist at Purdue University. So we spray eggs with oil to prevent bacteria from getting in, and refrigerate them to keep microorganisms at bay.\nWhy go to the trouble of washing eggs? A lot of it has to do with fear of salmonella.\n\"It just sort of seeped into our culture that chickens are dirty, or crawling with bacteria,\" says Ruhlman. (The Salt stumbled into this when our post started a #chickens*$!storm.)\nSalmonella enteritidis can infect a chicken's ovaries, contaminating a yolk before the shell firms up around it. Cooking usually kills the bacteria before they can harm you; still, eggs contaminated with salmonella are responsible for about 142,000 illnesses a year in the U.S., according to the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn some European countries, egg-laying hens are vaccinated against salmonella. In the U.S., vaccination is not required, but eggs must be washed and refrigerated from farm to store, and producers must follow a host of other safety measures.\n\"They're different approaches to basically achieve the same result,\" says Vincent Guyonnet, a poultry veterinarian and scientific adviser to the International Egg Commission. \"We don't have massive [food safety] issues on either side of the Atlantic. Both methods seem to work.\"\nThe important thing, he says, is to be consistent.\n\"Once you start refrigeration, you have to have it through the whole value chain, from farm to store. Because if you stop  if the eggs are cold and you put them in a warm environment  they're going to start sweating,\" says Guyonnet.\nNo one wants sweaty eggs. They can get moldy. Another perk of consistent refrigeration is shelf life: It jumps from about 21 days to almost 50 days.\nIn a lot of countries, constant refrigeration just isn't possible because it's simply too costly.\n\"Some of the countries cannot afford cold storage during the whole supply chain,\" says Chen.\nAnd as for why the U.S. and Europe developed such different attitudes about washing, it's also hard to tease apart how much is about safety versus egg aesthetics.\n\"In North America, we like to have everything superclean. So they probably initiated the washing of the egg very early on,\" leading down the refrigeration path, says Guyonnet.\nBut in a lot of places, \"a dirty egg with poop on it is no big deal. You brush it off when you get home,\" says Guyonnet, who was raised in France and now lives in Canada.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption \"Eggs shouldn't be refrigerated in the United States\" is out of context. The internal check has a confidence score of 10 because the image depicts eggs in a carton, providing no information about refrigeration practices.  The image itself is neutral and doesn't support or refute the claim.  The external check, with a confidence score of 8, provides strong evidence contradicting the caption.  It cites sources (presumably reputable sources like the FDA) that explicitly state that refrigeration of eggs is recommended in the United States due to the common practice of washing eggs, which removes the natural protective layer against bacterial contamination.  The consensus from both checks is that the caption's assertion is inaccurate regarding current practices and recommendations in the United States. There is no discrepancy between the two checks; both independently arrive at the same conclusion, that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) further reinforce this conclusion. The image only shows eggs; it offers no context to support or refute the claim about refrigeration practices.  External sources provide factual information about the recommendation to refrigerate eggs in the US to prevent salmonella contamination, directly contradicting the caption's statement. The high confidence levels are justified due to the unambiguous nature of the external sources and the image's lack of relevant information. No conflict or uncertainty exists in the validation process. The evidence unequivocally points towards the caption being out of context.",

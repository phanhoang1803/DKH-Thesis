However, without specific details about the protest or corroboration from news reports, it's impossible to definitively verify the claim. The date also doesn't trigger any immediate red flags about a known major event.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The caption \"Protesters blocked a road leading to the airport in Lagos on Oct. 12.\" aligns well with the image's content. The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) because the image clearly depicts a protest blocking a road, and the sign \"AIRPORT ACCESS PLAZA\" confirms the proximity to the airport. The mention of Lagos is also consistent with the visual context.  The external check provides moderate confidence (score 6), acknowledging the plausibility of such an event in a large city like Lagos but noting the lack of specific corroborating evidence.  The absence of specific details regarding the protest (e.g., news reports) doesn't invalidate the caption, however.  Both checks agree that the caption is consistent with the image; the internal check places higher confidence due to the direct visual evidence. The slight discrepancy in confidence scores stems from the external check's cautious approach, lacking specific independent verification.  No conflicts exist between the internal and external checks; they both support the caption's general accuracy. Considering the strong visual evidence and the lack of contradictory information, the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy is high (8/10).",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check is highly confident based on the strong visual alignment, while the external check shows moderate confidence due to the lack of specific corroborating information. The overall confidence is high, despite the slight difference in confidence scores from both checks."

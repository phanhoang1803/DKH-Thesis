      "explanation": "Roses are commonly sold in anticipation of Valentine's Day, and Abidjan, Ivory Coast is a city where such commercial activity would be expected.  The statement is plausible given the timing and subject matter. However, I cannot independently verify the specific event mentioned in the caption.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate. The image clearly shows a vendor selling roses, and the caption aligns with this observation by mentioning the sale of roses in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, before Valentine's Day.  The internal check highlights the alignment between the image content (roses being sold) and the caption's description (roses being sold in Abidjan before Valentine's Day). The slight ambiguity about the exact date (only \"Friday\" is specified) is not a significant enough discrepancy to warrant a low confidence score, especially since Valentine's Day rose sales are a common occurrence globally.\n\nThe external check corroborates the plausibility of the scenario. Valentine's Day rose sales are a widespread commercial event, and Abidjan, as a significant city, would reasonably participate in this practice. The fact that the external check acknowledges the inability to independently verify the specific date (which is not fully defined in the caption) shows a balanced and cautious assessment.  It also appropriately points out the common association between roses and Valentine's Day, thereby adding weight to the caption's likelihood.\n\nBoth checks have a confidence score of 8, indicating a significant level of agreement.  There are no substantial contradictions between the internal and external analyses.  The lack of explicit visual confirmation of the date (being \"Friday before Valentine's Day\") is the primary limitation, yet the overall context presented by both the image and the caption strongly suggests the accuracy of the statement. The uncertainty about the specific day mentioned in the caption is acknowledged but does not override the strong visual and contextual evidence supporting the caption's core claim.\n\nIn summary, while the lack of precise temporal information prevents a perfect match, the strong contextual congruence between the visual evidence and the caption's description yields a high overall confidence in the caption's accuracy. The plausibility of the described scene, supported by both internal and external validation, indicates that the caption is not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy.  While the exact date isn't explicitly verifiable, the context of roses being sold before Valentine's Day in Abidjan is highly plausible and consistent with the image."

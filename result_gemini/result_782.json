        "content": "Claim:\nBackless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016.\nIn November 2016, an image macro appeared bearing the unsourced claim that \"backless booster\" seats would be illegal starting in December 2016, and quickly made the usual rounds on social media. It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows a low confidence score (8) because while the image depicts a child in a car seat, the type of car seat is not clearly identifiable. The caption mentions a ban on backless booster seats, which is factually accurate in the context of the external check. However, the external check reveals that the caption is out of context because it refers to a false claim circulating on social media, not an actual law or regulation. The external check has a high confidence score (10) due to its evidence from fact-checking websites that refute the claim. There is a discrepancy between the internal and external checks regarding the accuracy of the caption. The external check provides strong evidence that the caption is false and is based on a debunked social media meme. The internal check has some uncertainty, primarily due to the lack of clarity of the car seat in the image, but it does acknowledge the general accuracy of the statement about bans on backless booster seats in certain contexts. Considering the strong evidence from the external check and the uncertainty of the internal check, we can confidently conclude that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong external evidence and the overall context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows low confidence due to image ambiguity, while the external check strongly refutes the caption's claim as a false social media meme. The external evidence outweighs the uncertainty of the internal check, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

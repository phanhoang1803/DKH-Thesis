On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the photograph depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man.  Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check examines the image itself.  It finds no visual evidence to support the caption's assertions. The image shows a young girl with a swollen abdomen, sitting on a hospital bed. However, the image provides no information regarding her age, the cause of her abdominal swelling, or the identity of any individuals involved.  The internal check assigns a confidence score of 0 because the image alone is insufficient to verify or refute the caption's claims.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external validation uses evidence from external sources to assess the caption's accuracy.  The external check identifies a fact-checking website, Snopes.com, that directly addresses this specific claim. Snopes definitively debunks the caption's narrative, stating that the image is miscaptioned.  The actual subject of the photograph is a 12-year-old girl suffering from a medical condition unrelated to pregnancy.  Snopes provides strong evidence and assigns a high confidence score of 10 to its conclusion that the caption is false.\n\nDiscrepancies and Conflicts:\nThere is no direct conflict between the internal and external checks. The internal check acknowledges the lack of visual evidence to support the claim, resulting in a low confidence score.  The external check provides compelling evidence contradicting the claim, leading to a high confidence score.  Both checks converge on the conclusion that the original caption is inaccurate.\n\nWeighting of Confidence Scores:\nGiven the significant discrepancy in confidence scores (0 from internal vs. 10 from external), the higher confidence score from the external check dominates.  Snopes's detailed investigation and refutation of the claim are far more significant than the lack of visual evidence. The external validation's conclusion is strongly supported by a reputable source.\n\nEntity Analysis and Cross-Validation:\nThe entities mentioned in the caption (9-year-old girl, Muslim man, impregnation) are not visually verifiable in the image. The external check's identification of a 12-year-old girl with a different medical condition supports the absence of these entities as depicted in the caption.\n\nFinal Assessment:\nThe original caption is significantly out of context.  The external validation, with its high confidence score based on factual evidence from a trusted source, strongly indicates that the image was miscaptioned.  Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is reached with a high degree of confidence (10).\n\nIn summary, the lack of visual evidence supporting the claim internally, coupled with the strong external refutation from a reputable source, conclusively demonstrates that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context.  No reasonable interpretation of the image and external information supports the original caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is false and out of context.  Internal analysis finds no visual evidence supporting the claim, while external fact-checking decisively refutes it."

Her willingness to compromise, including potentially stepping down earlier than planned, was widely reported. While the exact details of the Cabinet discussions are not fully public, the core claim that she presented a deal and was willing to compromise to secure its passage is consistent with widely available reporting. The phrasing is slightly dramatized (\\\"impassioned\\\" debate) but not to an implausible degree.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly support the accuracy of the caption.  The internal check highlights the perfect alignment between the image (Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street) and the caption's description of her announcement regarding a Brexit deal. The external check corroborates the historical context, referencing Theresa May's premiership during Brexit negotiations, her multiple attempts to secure parliamentary approval for a deal, and the widespread media coverage of her willingness to compromise, potentially including an early resignation, to achieve this goal.  While the caption uses slightly dramatic language (e.g., \"impassioned\" debate), this doesn't invalidate the core information.  The external check's supporting points directly address the key elements of the caption â€“ May's role, the Brexit negotiations, parliamentary challenges, and her potential early resignation.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both assessments offer high confidence scores (10 and 8 respectively), further strengthening the overall assessment of the caption's accuracy.  The image serves as strong visual evidence supporting the caption's claims.  The high degree of alignment between the visual and textual information, coupled with robust external verification, leads to a high confidence score of 9.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The image aligns perfectly with the caption's description, and external sources confirm the historical context of Theresa May's Brexit negotiations and her willingness to compromise, including potentially resigning early, to secure a deal.  There are no significant discrepancies between the checks."

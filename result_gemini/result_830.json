      "explanation": "The statement is plausible but lacks sufficient information for verification.  It's possible for someone to visit Raby Castle regularly with their dog. However, without further information on Mr. Gunton's identity or confirmation of his daily visits, it's impossible to definitively confirm the claim. The lack of specific details lowers confidence.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation both agree that the caption is likely out of context.  The internal check points out the lack of visual evidence to support the claim that the image depicts Mr. Gunton and his dog, Max, at Raby Castle.  The confidence score of 3 reflects this lack of visual confirmation of the individuals mentioned in the caption. The external check supports this assessment by highlighting the plausibility of the statement but the lack of concrete evidence to verify it. The confidence score of 4 underscores the difficulty in verifying the claim without further information.  The external check does point out that Raby Castle exists, and dogs are commonly allowed in outdoor areas of such locations, and that daily visits are possible. However, these facts alone do not confirm the specific claim made in the caption.  Therefore, the combined evidence from both checks supports a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context. The low confidence scores in both checks, 3 and 4, reflect the lack of definitive evidence to support or refute the caption completely.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both concur on the lack of sufficient evidence to validate the caption. This aligns well with a conservative assessment in the absence of clear visual proof or external information confirming the identity of the individuals and the event described in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks agree that the caption is likely out of context due to the lack of sufficient evidence to verify the claim. The checks do not conflict; they both emphasize the absence of definitive proof linking the image to the specific people and event mentioned in the caption."

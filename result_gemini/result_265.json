      "explanation": "The claim that the FBI raided the CDC in the middle of the night to seize data on a link between vaccines and autism is factually incorrect. There is no credible evidence of such a raid, and the claim promotes a debunked conspiracy theory.  The scientific consensus is that there is no link between vaccines and autism.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds no evidence in the image to support the claim of an FBI raid on the CDC. The image simply shows the CDC building.  The external check definitively refutes the claim as a false conspiracy theory, citing the lack of credible reporting and the established scientific consensus against a link between vaccines and autism.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 1 respectively) strongly support the conclusion that the caption is completely fabricated and bears no relation to the provided image. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and overwhelmingly reject the caption's claim.  The external check's supporting points are crucial in establishing the falsity of the caption: the absence of any reputable news coverage of such a significant event, and the robust scientific evidence refuting the vaccine-autism link, are collectively compelling evidence against the caption's veracity.  The entity analysis aligns perfectly with both checks: the image depicts the CDC building, and the caption falsely alleges an event that never happened.  Therefore, there's no basis to doubt the consensus reached by the internal and external validation processes.  The evidence strongly suggests the caption is not merely inaccurate, but intentionally misleading.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks decisively confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows the CDC building, while the caption falsely claims an FBI raid based on a debunked conspiracy theory.  There is complete agreement between the checks, with high confidence scores."

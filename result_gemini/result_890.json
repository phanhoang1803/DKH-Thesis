      "explanation": "The news caption is factually implausible. Hillary Clinton is a public figure, and her death would be a major global news event, widely reported and verified across numerous credible sources. There is no evidence or reporting from reputable news organizations to support the claim of her accidental death during a documentary filming. The scenario described is highly improbable and lacks any supporting evidence.",
      "supporting_points": "Hillary Clinton is a well-known public figure. Major events in the lives of public figures are widely reported. There is no credible reporting to support this claim.  The absence of such widespread reporting makes the claim highly unlikely.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check points out a direct contradiction: the image shows Hillary Clinton speaking, while the caption claims she was accidentally killed.  The external check reinforces this by highlighting the implausibility of such a significant event—the death of a prominent public figure—going unreported by major news outlets. The lack of any credible news reporting supporting the caption's claim further strengthens the conclusion that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and strongly support the conclusion that the caption is false and does not accurately reflect the content of the image.  The high confidence scores (10 for both checks) contribute to the overall high confidence score of 10 for the final assessment.  The evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is completely out of context and misrepresents the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly agree that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context.  The image depicts Hillary Clinton speaking, while the caption falsely states she was accidentally killed.  The lack of credible news reports supporting the claim further confirms its inaccuracy."

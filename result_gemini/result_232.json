      "explanation": "The caption \"#Tshisekedi: Moving forward to a better future for the #DRC\" is plausible.  Felix Tshisekedi is the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and it's common for leaders to express aspirations for national improvement. However, without specific context or verifiable policy details, it remains a general statement. The claim is not inherently false, but its truthfulness depends on the specific actions and progress made by the government.",
      "supporting_points": "Felix Tshisekedi is the president of the DRC. Political leaders often use such optimistic language in their public statements.  The statement lacks specifics and is not easily verifiable without further details on policies and their impact.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses doubt about the caption's accuracy due to a lack of visual evidence linking the image's subjects to Tshisekedi or the DRC.  The confidence score is relatively low (7) because the visual evidence alone is insufficient to confirm the caption's claim.  The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of the caption (given Tshisekedi's position and the common use of such statements by political leaders), highlights the lack of specific details and the difficulty of verifying the claim without further information on policies and their impact. The confidence score is moderate (8).  There is a discrepancy between the internal and external assessments. The internal check is more conservative because it directly assesses the image's content, which lacks explicit confirmation of Tshisekedi's presence or direct association with the depicted individuals.  The external check is slightly more optimistic because it considers the broader context of political statements, recognizing the general likelihood of such statements by a national leader. The lower confidence score (6) reflects this uncertainty and the lack of definitive visual evidence to support the caption's assertion.  To resolve the discrepancy, we must note that neither the internal nor external check provides definitive proof.  Visual identification of Tshisekedi is needed for the internal check to provide stronger support, and concrete policy achievements would strengthen the external check. The combined analysis reveals insufficient evidence to confirm the caption is fully accurate.  The caption is likely plausible in its sentiment, but the image doesn't offer visual confirmation, hence the \"Out Of Context\" assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds insufficient visual evidence to confirm the caption's claim, resulting in a low confidence score (7). The external check recognizes the general plausibility of the caption but highlights the lack of verifiable specifics, producing a moderate confidence score (8).  The discrepancy stems from the differing perspectives: internal focuses on image content, external on political context.  Combined, the evidence is insufficient to confirm the caption's accuracy, suggesting it is out of context."

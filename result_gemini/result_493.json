Human death is generally considered irreversible after cessation of vital bodily functions. While there may be cultural beliefs and practices surrounding death and resurrection, those should be interpreted as symbolic or spiritual rather than literal revivals.  The news caption conflates cultural practices with medical or biological possibilities. Therefore the claim requires strong external evidence to support it. Without such evidence, it is highly implausible.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Indonesian villagers performed a rite that brought a dead woman back to life after three years in the grave.  Internal consistency checks reveal a moderate alignment between the caption and the image. The image depicts Indonesian villagers with what seems to be a deceased woman. However, the image does not directly support the claim of resurrection. The caption's mention of Indonesian villagers aligns with the visual content, yielding a confidence score of 8. However, external validation casts serious doubt on the caption's claim.  The assertion that a woman was revived after three years is highly improbable based on scientific understanding of human death, where death is typically considered irreversible after vital functions cease.  While cultural practices exist around death and resurrection, those are often symbolic or spiritual, not literal revivals. The external check highlights the implausibility of the claim, lacking strong supporting evidence and achieving a confidence score of 1.  The conflict between the internal and external checks arises due to the ambiguity of the image. While the image depicts a scene possibly consistent with a ritual, it does not visually confirm the claim of resurrection. The lack of verifiable evidence from reputable sources significantly undermines the original caption's claim. Therefore,  considering the low confidence score from external validation and the absence of definitive proof within the image, the caption is deemed out of context. The low confidence score of 2 reflects the significant uncertainty and implausibility associated with the claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows moderate alignment, while external check strongly refutes the claim of resurrection, leading to an out-of-context assessment."

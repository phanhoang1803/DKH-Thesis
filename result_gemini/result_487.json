      "explanation": "While Brian Kilmeade is a Fox & Friends co-host and Prince Philip's death was a public event, there is no verifiable evidence to support the claim that Kilmeade blamed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for it.  Blaming individuals for a death, especially one due to natural causes or old age (Prince Philip's death was attributed to age), requires significant evidence. Without credible sources confirming Kilmeade made such a statement, this claim is unsubstantiated.",

    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check aligns the entities mentioned in the caption with the image, finding a match between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. However, it acknowledges the absence of Brian Kilmeade and any visual evidence supporting the claim about Prince Philip's death.  The internal check's confidence is high (10) due to the clear presence of Harry and Meghan.  The external check, however, casts significant doubt on the caption's accuracy.  It finds no reliable news reports or statements from Brian Kilmeade supporting the claim that he blamed Harry and Meghan for Prince Philip's death. The external check's low confidence score (2) reflects the lack of verifiable evidence.  The discrepancy lies in the fact that while the image verifies the presence of Harry and Meghan, the core claim of the caption—Kilmeade's blame—lacks external validation.  There's no independent corroboration to support this.   The low confidence score from the external check significantly outweighs the internal check's higher confidence, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The overall low confidence score reflects the substantial uncertainty surrounding the key claim within the caption.  Further investigation is needed to verify Kilmeade's alleged statement. Without credible sources backing this statement, the assertion remains unsubstantiated. In conclusion, the absence of external evidence supporting Kilmeade's purported blame, despite the image showing Harry and Meghan, makes the caption out of context. We must rely on verifiable information to determine the truth of any claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the image but notes the absence of Brian Kilmeade and evidence related to the claim of blaming them for Prince Philip's death.  External check strongly refutes the claim due to a lack of credible sources.  The significant discrepancy and low external confidence score lead to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

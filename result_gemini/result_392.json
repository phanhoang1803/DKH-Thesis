        "content": "Claim:\nRush Limbaugh's final net worth was revealed and it left his family in tears.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nRush Limbaugh's net worth was the subject of an online advertisement following his death on Feb. 17, 2021. The conservative radio personality died after battling lung cancer.\nThe ad in question featured a photograph of Limbaugh and read: \"[Photos] Rush Limbaugh's Final Net Worth Left His Family In Tears.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a slideshow article with 254 pages. Each page featured a celebrity and his or her purported net worth.\nWe clicked through the entire story. It wasn't surprising to us that Limbaugh never showed up on any of the 254 pages. The article didn't mention his name even once. The ad was nothing more than clickbait.\nAside from the ad, the article seemed less than trustworthy. For example, Parker Schnabel of the \"Gold Rush\" reality TV series was featured on three different pages. Two pages claimed he was worth $8 million, while a third page said the figure was $10 million.\nAccording to the story, former TV news personality Megyn Kelly was purportedly worth both $30 million and $55 million at the same time, an incredible feat.\nNear the end of the story, actress Milana Vayntrub was featured on page 250. She is best known in her role as Lily Adams on AT&T television commercials and has been featured in the past in misleading advertisements.\nThe final page featured Monica Lewinsky, who previously was the target of a similar ad.\nAside from lengthy articles like this one, some readers might often find net worth dollar figures that appear above Google searches. While these might be interesting for discussion, there's perhaps little data behind those numbers to support their accuracy.\nAs for Limbaugh's actual net worth, the real figure was not made public. A number of websites have mentioned an amount of around $600 million. However, several of those websites all cited the same source for the figure. That single source only publishes estimates.\nIn sum, Limbaugh's net worth did not leave his family in tears. We've seen the same \"net worth left his family in tears\" trope for former \"Jeopardy\" host Alex Trebek and a number of other celebrities. All of those stories have been rated \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Rush Limbaugh's final net worth was revealed and left his family in tears.  Both the internal and external checks decisively refute this claim.\n\nInternal Check: The internal check, with a confidence score of 0, correctly identifies that the image contains Donald Trump and another unidentified man, neither of whom is Rush Limbaugh.  This directly contradicts the caption's subject, resulting in a false verdict.  The absence of Limbaugh in the image provides strong evidence against the caption's accuracy.\n\nExternal Check: The external check, boasting a confidence score of 10, corroborates the internal check's findings.  It references a Snopes article that explicitly debunks the claim about Limbaugh's net worth being revealed and causing his family distress.  Snopes attributes the claim to misleading online advertisements and clickbait articles that disseminated false information.  The article's high confidence and specific details (e.g., the claim's origin, the lack of public disclosure of Limbaugh's net worth) strongly support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate. \n\nDiscrepancy Analysis: There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both independently arrive at the same conclusion: the caption is false. The high confidence scores from both checks (0 for internal and 10 for external) align perfectly in indicating a significant mismatch between the image content and the caption's statement. \n\nEntity Analysis:  The image is devoid of any mention of Rush Limbaugh.  This absence further supports the internal and external assessments.  The presence of Donald Trump and another man only serves to highlight that the image's content is unrelated to the claim in the caption.\n\nConfidence Assessment: Given the perfect alignment of the internal and external checks, both exhibiting high confidence, the overall confidence score is also high (10).  There is no uncertainty; the evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the caption is out of context and factually incorrect.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The image shows Donald Trump and another man, not Rush Limbaugh, and the claim in the caption is debunked by Snopes as false."

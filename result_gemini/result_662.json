  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the caption's assertion that the image depicts the carrying away of an Ebola victim's coffin.  The internal check gives high confidence (10) due to the clear visual evidence of a coffin being carried by individuals in a setting that suggests a possible health crisis. The protective gear worn by the carriers further strengthens this interpretation. The external check provides a confidence score of 8.  The external check acknowledges the plausible link between the image and the caption, noting that Ebola victims are often buried in coffins to prevent the disease's spread. However, it correctly points out the lack of definitive contextual information. The absence of explicit confirmation that the death was indeed caused by Ebola is the reason for the slightly lower external confidence score. There are no major discrepancies between the internal and external validation processes. Both recognize the visual elements strongly supporting the caption, but the external check remains cautious due to the lack of explicit confirmation of the cause of death. This cautious approach is justified. The visual evidence aligns with the caption, making it highly probable that it's an accurate representation of the event. The slightly lower score from the external check acknowledges that while the caption is very likely true based on the visuals, it is not absolutely certain without further contextual details.  The absence of contradictory information or alternative interpretations from either internal or external checks leads to a high overall confidence score of 9.  The image strongly suggests the coffin contains an Ebola victim, given the protective clothing and the overall context of the scene.  While external sources are unable to independently verify the cause of death in this specific case, they confirm the general practice of burying Ebola victims in coffins.  The combined evidence strongly supports the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption, though the external check acknowledges a lack of complete certainty due to missing contextual details.  Visual evidence strongly suggests the coffin contains an Ebola victim, aligning with the caption's statement. The overall confidence is high, but slightly reduced due to the lack of definitive external confirmation regarding the cause of death."

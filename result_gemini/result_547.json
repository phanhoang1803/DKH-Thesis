It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check incorrectly assessed the caption as accurate, assigning a confidence score of 10.  However, the external validation check, using a Snopes fact-check, definitively demonstrates the quote is false and not attributable to Jodie Foster.  The Snopes fact-check provides strong evidence that the quote originated from social media and has been falsely attributed to the actress.  There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks.  The high confidence score from the internal check is due to the visual presence of Jodie Foster in the image and the apparent presence of the quote in the image. However, the image alone does not confirm authorship. The external check's high confidence score (also 10) stems from a reputable fact-checking website directly addressing and debunking the claim.  Given the conflicting results, the external validation takes precedence due to its verifiable source and rigorous methodology. The internal assessment failed to consider the crucial aspect of source verification, leading to its inaccurate conclusion.  The overwhelming evidence from the Snopes fact-check strongly suggests the caption is out of context and should be marked as false. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the caption is out of context and the confidence score is high (10) because of the strong and reliable evidence from Snopes refuting the claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation incorrectly confirmed the caption; external validation (Snopes fact-check) strongly refutes it, showing the quote is misattributed to Jodie Foster.  The external validation is prioritized due to its reliable source and methodology."

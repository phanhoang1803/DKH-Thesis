Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a pile of gold during his time in the military.\nIn June 2020, an old photograph supposedly showing U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

    "explanation": "The original caption accurately describes the image's content and the context surrounding its circulation. Both the internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check highlights a slight uncertainty about definitively confirming the soldier's identity as Senator Tom Cotton, giving a confidence score of 8. However, the external check strongly supports the caption with a confidence score of 10, corroborating the claim based on external sources.  The external check's supporting point directly quotes a source stating that a photo supposedly showing Senator Cotton sitting on gold bars circulated on social media in June 2020. This aligns perfectly with the original caption.  Considering both checks, there's a strong consensus that the caption is not out of context.  The internal check's minor uncertainty stems from the inability to conclusively confirm the identity of the soldier in the photograph based solely on the image itself.  However, this uncertainty is significantly mitigated by the external check's corroboration through a reliable source. The overall high confidence score reflects this strong alignment between the original caption and the verified information from external sources. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks; they both validate the accuracy of the original caption, though the internal check expresses a slightly lower confidence score due to the inherent limitation of image-based identification.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy.  The external check provides strong corroboration from a reliable source, outweighing the internal check's slight uncertainty about the soldier's identity.  The caption is not out of context."

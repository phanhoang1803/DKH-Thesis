In April, anti-government protesters demanded that the socialist president, Mr Ortega, step down over unpopular pension reforms.\nHowever, he refused to negotiate and instead sent in the security forces.\nHundreds were then killed in the space of weeks.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check confirms the image depicts Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo, aligning with their roles as Nicaraguan President and Vice President.  The high confidence score (10) reflects the clear visual evidence and accurate identification of individuals and their positions. The external check further solidifies this assessment by citing a news source explicitly stating that Ortega named his wife, Murillo, as his running mate for the vice-presidency in November. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check emphasizes the strong corroborating evidence. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both independently and consistently support the caption's accuracy.  The alignment of evidence across both checks strengthens the overall confidence in the caption's validity. The absence of conflicting information or any uncertainty in either assessment contributes to a high overall confidence score of 10. In summary, the strong agreement between the visual analysis and the external news source leaves no room for doubt regarding the caption's accuracy. The caption is not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations confirm the caption's accuracy, showing strong agreement on the identification of individuals and their roles.  High confidence scores (10 for both) indicate a highly accurate caption that is not out of context."

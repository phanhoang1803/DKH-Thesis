One such example  supposedly originating with the medical sage known as \"old Chinese doctor\"  held that consuming a bowl of boiled garlic water would \"improve and cure\" persons afflicted with the malady overnight:\nGarlic has long been claimed as possessing qualities that aid in the prevention and treatment of various illnesses, including colds and flu, but scientific evidence supporting such claims is weak or lacking.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) specifically addressed this rumor in reference to COVID-19 and noted that although \"garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties,\" there's no evidence that \"eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus\":\nBBC News similarly reported of this rumor that:\nIn lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren't harmful in themselves, as long as they aren't preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be.\nThe South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic.\nWe know, in general, that eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water can be good for staying healthy. However, there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus.\nOn the plus side, this \"treatment\" might help keep away others who could potentially infect you.",

Source 1 explicitly states that the claim of boiled garlic water curing COVID-19 is false and that there is no evidence supporting this claim.  The source cites the World Health Organization's statement that while garlic has some antimicrobial properties, there's no evidence it protects against the coronavirus.

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no connection between the image (a bunch of garlic bulbs) and the caption (claim about boiled garlic water curing coronavirus).  The confidence score of 10 reflects the complete lack of alignment.  The external check reinforces this conclusion by citing a reliable source (likely a news article or health organization statement) that directly refutes the claim made in the caption.  The external check also provides a confidence score of 10, highlighting the strong evidence against the caption's validity. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks, resulting in a high overall confidence score of 10. No discrepancies or conflicts exist. The analysis shows a clear mismatch between the visual content and the textual claim.  The image depicts a simple bunch of garlic, while the caption promotes an unsubstantiated medical claim. Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context.",

TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didnt come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely. Thurston County Democrats needs your help fighting fascistic disinformation. www.ThurstonDemocrats.org. Thank you.",

The source states that images circulating online claiming to recruit \"professional anarchists\" are fake and part of a disinformation campaign.

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no alignment between the image (a graffiti artwork of a figure with flowers) and the caption (a recruitment flyer for professional anarchists).  The confidence score of 0 reflects this complete mismatch. The external check provides strong evidence from a source explicitly debunking the existence of such recruitment flyers, labeling them as fake and part of a disinformation campaign. The high confidence score of 10 signifies the strong external evidence contradicting the caption. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks, pointing towards a clear case of the caption being completely out of context. The image depicts a piece of art, while the caption describes a fabricated recruitment poster. No evidence supports the caption's claim. The external source's assertion that the images are fabricated to discredit democrats further strengthens the conclusion that the caption is misleading and unrelated to the image.  Therefore, combining the internal and external evaluations leads to a high confidence (10) in the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context with respect to the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly reject the original caption.  The image is a piece of art, not a recruitment flyer. External evidence confirms the flyer described in the caption is fake."

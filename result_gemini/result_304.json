        "content": "Claim:\nThe Missouri state government issued \"[N-word] hunting\" licenses.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn October 2014, photos of a \"[N-word] hunting\" license circulated on social media sites, often accompanied by a message claiming the license had been issued by the state of Missouri:\nThe pictured license was not issued by the state of Missouri, nor did it provide the holder the legal right to hunt and kill African-Americans. It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim in the news caption. While racist memorabilia depicting \"nigger hunting\" licenses existed and were even sold at an event, the article explicitly states that these licenses were not issued by the state of Missouri.  The caption's assertion is therefore false.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (score 10) that the caption accurately reflects the content of the image. The image clearly displays a document titled \"NIGGER HUNTING LICENSE\" and mentions \"Missouri.\" However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  With a confidence score of 8, the external check (Snopes article) contradicts the caption's assertion.  The external source explicitly states that despite the existence of racist memorabilia with similar titles, no such license was ever officially issued by the state of Missouri. This creates a direct conflict between the internal and external evidence. \n\nTo resolve this conflict, we must weigh the evidence. The internal check relies solely on the visual content of the image, which is limited in scope. It doesn't offer proof of authenticity or official issuance. The external check, on the other hand, draws on a broader investigation, referencing a reputable source (Snopes) that delves into the history and context of such documents. Therefore, the external verification holds more weight.\n\nThe entity analysis supports the external verification. The key entities are \"NIGGER HUNTING LICENSE,\" \"Missouri,\" and the claim of official issuance. While the image displays the first two entities, the external check refutes the claim of official issuance by the state of Missouri.  The external source provides crucial context missing from the image alone, explaining the existence of similar racist artifacts while emphasizing the absence of an official license from Missouri.\n\nGiven the higher confidence score of the external check (8) and its corroboration by entity analysis, and the inherent limitations of relying solely on image content for verification, we conclude that the caption is out of context. The image depicts a racist artifact but does not accurately reflect a document officially issued by the State of Missouri.  The existence of the artifact itself is not disputed; the claim of its official issuance is.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check (image analysis) confirms caption's alignment with the image content, but external check (Snopes) refutes the claim of official issuance by Missouri, resulting in a contradiction. External check and entity analysis are given more weight due to the broader context and evidence they provide."

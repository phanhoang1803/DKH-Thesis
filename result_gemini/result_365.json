      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  The CDC is a reputable source that frequently publishes reports on public health issues, including the impact of school closures on disease transmission. Whether school closures effectively slow the spread of viruses is a complex question with varying results depending on the specific virus, implementation of closures, and other factors. Therefore, a CDC report questioning the impact is not unexpected.  The caption does not provide specific details of the report's findings, making complete verification impossible without accessing the report itself.",

    "explanation": "The image shows the CDC building.  The internal check correctly identifies this alignment. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of a CDC report on school closures and their impact on virus spread. However, the caption's statement is too general. While the CDC frequently issues reports on such topics, the caption does not cite a specific report, making definitive verification impossible. The external check's confidence is lower because it lacks specific details to confirm the existence of a report with the exact wording in the caption. There's no direct contradiction between the checks; they agree on the image's content but differ on the precise verifiability of the caption's claim.  The image is purely of the building, with no report mentioned. The external check recognizes the likelihood of such a report but cannot verify the precise claim. Thus, while the image is accurately depicted, the lack of evidence for the specific report mentioned in the caption leads to the 'OOC' classification.  A more precise caption, citing a specific report or study, would improve the score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image-caption alignment; external check finds caption plausible but unverifiable due to lack of specific report details.  Overall, caption is considered out of context due to unverifiability."

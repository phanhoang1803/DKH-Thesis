    "explanation": "The claim that the FBI raided the CDC headquarters to search for data linking vaccines to autism is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check correctly identifies the image as depicting the CDC headquarters, aligning with the caption's mention of the CDC. However, it flags the discrepancy of the caption's claim regarding an FBI raidâ€”an event entirely absent from the image. The internal check's low confidence score (8) reflects this partial alignment and significant missing information. The external check provides a strong rebuttal (confidence score of 10), decisively rejecting the caption's central assertion. The external check grounds its verdict on the complete lack of credible evidence supporting such a raid. The claim is easily falsifiable; a clandestine operation of this magnitude and sensitive nature would inevitably leak into the public domain through news reports or official statements. No such reporting exists.  Furthermore, the external check rightly points out the well-established scientific consensus refuting any causal relationship between vaccines and autism. The vast body of scientific literature unequivocally demonstrates the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and the debunking of this specific misconception is widely available to anyone.  The conflict between the image and the caption's central claim is irreconcilable. The image shows only the building's exterior; it provides no evidence of any activity, let alone a clandestine raid of the magnitude described. Even if the image were ambiguous, the complete absence of any corroborating evidence from reliable news sources or government records makes the claim highly improbable and definitively unverified.  The combined internal and external evidence creates a strong consensus.  There is no internal alignment on the core claim of the caption. The lack of external verification, coupled with the established scientific consensus on vaccines and autism, leaves no room for alternative interpretations. The external verification's confidence is reinforced by the extensive documentation readily available on vaccine safety and the debunking of the autism connection. In conclusion, both the visual and factual evidence decisively demonstrates that the caption is out of context, with very high confidence (10).",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly reject the caption's claim of an FBI raid on the CDC to investigate a link between vaccines and autism. The image lacks evidence of a raid, and the claim itself is a debunked conspiracy theory unsupported by any credible evidence."

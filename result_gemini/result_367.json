        "content": "The idea for the project came from Nelson Nol, an entrepreneur who heads Sorocaba's prosthetic branch. He said that the calendar will be sold nationally, and the collected monies will cover not only cover the costs of the campaign, but will create a fund to help families who can not afford prosthetics. \"[The purpose] is to promote beauty, to show that you have life after amputation, and that these patients can lead full lives that include attending clubs, hanging out with friends, and dating,\" stresses Nol.\nThe goal is to show that amputation is only a detail, and that beauty is a matter of attitude. The pictures are all in black and white, but the prostheses will be featured in vivid color images. The initiative is a way to show that physical limitations can not take away a woman's most valuable asset: pride.\nBanker Jaqueline Felizberto opened up in the photographs. She lost her right leg at seven years old when she was hit by a truck in front of her house. But the trauma has not hindered her life. \"I have a normal life: super, super busy, well run. I really enjoy my makeup, go out and have fun. I love the beach. I like to enjoy a lot,\" says the banker turned model for a day.\nCamile Rodrigues was born with a malformed leg, but that did not stop her from becoming a top athlete. At the Pan-American Games in 2011, the swimmer took three silver medals and one bronze. For her, the concept of beauty has little to do with aesthetics. \"Beauty to me is happiness. I think if you're happy, you're beautiful.\"",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check points out a lack of visual evidence supporting the claim of the women being wounded female veterans, while the external check directly refutes this claim with evidence showing the image depicts Brazilian amputees, not US veterans.  The high confidence scores (10) from both checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. There is no conflict between the internal and external assessments; they are entirely consistent in their conclusions. The entity alignment is also problematic: the caption mentions \"wounded female veterans,\" which is not supported by the image itself, only showing women with prosthetic legs.  The external validation strengthens this by clarifying their nationality and identity as amputees, not necessarily veterans, significantly altering the context of the image.  The discrepancies highlight the importance of relying on both internal and external verification to accurately assess the context of an image and its caption.  The available evidence completely refutes the caption, leading to a high degree of confidence in the conclusion that it is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks decisively show that the original caption is inaccurate, with strong evidence suggesting the picture depicts Brazilian amputees, not US veterans as stated. The high confidence score reflects a complete alignment between the two assessment methods."

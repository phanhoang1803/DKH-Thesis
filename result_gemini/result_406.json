Working title is 8 Mile 2 and it will be about my life after I came up and will follow basically my whole career. Im really looking forward to seeing this movie with yall and I hope you like it as much as Ive liked filming it.\nSurprisingly, the flick is being directed by none other than Clint Eastwood, a man you dont normally think of when you think of rap. Eastwood had his own comments about the upcoming film:\nThis movie was a big challenge for me, not only because of the subject matter, but also because its hard to dramatize a mans entire career like we set out to do. Nevertheless I am very pleased with how things are going and I think were really coming up with a multi-dimensional, well rounded story about Eminems career, both the bright and the dark parts.",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives high confidence (10) that the caption accurately reflects the image's content, showing Eminem and aligning with the subject matter of the movie \"8 Mile.\" However, the external check strongly contradicts (confidence 1) this assertion by citing a source that explicitly states there are no plans for an \"8 Mile\" sequel. This significant discrepancy necessitates a low overall confidence score. The external evidence refutes the claim made in the caption regarding a 2016 sequel. While the image aligns with the movie, the claim of a sequel in 2016 is demonstrably false based on the provided external source.  Therefore, the caption is out of context because the core claim regarding the sequel's existence and release date is factually incorrect. There is no ambiguity; the external source directly addresses and negates the caption's central assertion.  The strong internal alignment is misleading, as it only focuses on the image's direct representation of Eminem and does not validate the claim regarding a sequel. A thorough validation process necessitates considering both the visual content and the accuracy of all textual claims. In this case, the factual inaccuracy of the sequel claim overrides the image's relevance to the movie \"8 Mile.\"",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in caption-image alignment, but external check decisively refutes the claim of an \"8 Mile\" sequel in 2016.  The external evidence is conclusive, resulting in an out-of-context assessment."

The presence of a woman among the injured is also consistent with the demographics of Afghanistan. However, the specific number of wounded (90) and the details of the explosion require external verification to confirm the accuracy of this particular caption.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check aligns well with the image content; the image shows women in what seems to be a hospital in Kabul, supporting the caption's mention of an Afghan woman being helped at a Kabul hospital. However, the external check introduces uncertainty. While the context of Kabul's history of violence and explosions is plausible, the specific number of wounded (90) and details of the explosion are unverified.  The claim of 90 wounded people requires verification from external sources like news reports or official statements. The absence of such corroborating evidence weakens the caption's overall credibility.  Therefore, considering the lack of external confirmation for the key numerical detail (90 wounded), the caption's overall confidence score is lowered. Although the core elements of the caption—an Afghan woman, being helped, in a Kabul hospital—are supported by the image, the lack of reliable external validation regarding the context of the explosion and its casualty numbers leads to a 'out of context' assessment, albeit with a relatively high confidence score considering the image's consistency with parts of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption's core elements (Afghan woman, helped, Kabul hospital), but external verification is lacking for the specific details of the incident (90 wounded in an explosion). The absence of external confirmation on the scale of the event lowers the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy. Despite the visual alignment, the unverified number of casualties results in an OOC judgement."

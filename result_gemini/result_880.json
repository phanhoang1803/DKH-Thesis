      "explanation": "The claim of a Sasquatch sexual assault is highly implausible due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the existence of Sasquatch itself.  While bizarre claims are sometimes reported, this one lacks any supporting details or corroboration, raising serious doubts about its veracity. The sensational nature of the claim is a significant red flag.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is completely out of context with the provided image. The internal check finds no alignment between the image's content (a person in a white furry suit in a snowy forest) and the caption's description of a Sasquatch sexual assault.  The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete lack of any connection.  The external check further reinforces this conclusion by pointing out the implausibility of the Sasquatch sexual assault claim itself. The lack of credible evidence for the existence of Sasquatch, the unsubstantiated and sensational nature of the claim, and the absence of any corroborating evidence all contribute to a high confidence score of 2 in rejecting the caption's relevance to the image.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they are in complete agreement that the caption is irrelevant and fabricated. The image depicts a person in a costume, possibly for artistic or theatrical purposes, while the caption describes a highly improbable event involving a mythical creature. There's no overlap in subject matter, setting, or narrative.  The external validation delves into the broader context of the claim's credibility, highlighting its sensational and unsubstantiated nature within the realm of cryptozoology.  The absence of any supporting evidence or corroboration further strengthens the assessment that the claim is not only unrelated to the image but also highly questionable in itself.  Given the unanimous and strong agreement between the internal and external assessments, and the lack of any ambiguity or conflicting information, the final confidence score is 10, reflecting complete certainty in the caption's irrelevance to the image. In summary, the discrepancies between the image's content and the caption's narrative are too significant to ignore. This is not a case of misinterpretation or minor factual inaccuracy; it's a complete mismatch of subject matter. Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is firmly supported by both the internal analysis of image content and the external assessment of the claim's plausibility.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly confirm that the caption is entirely out of context with the image.  The image shows a person in a white furry suit, while the caption describes an implausible Sasquatch sexual assault claim.  There is no overlap whatsoever."

Mark Mezvinski is George Soros (sic) nephew!!\"\nThis post, which includes the words @illuminati killers, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim isnt a new one, and it was amplified by the actress Roseanne Barr last year when she accused Clinton of being married to Soros nephew and tweeted: \"Chelsea Soros Clinton.\"\nClinton retweeted Barr  Barrs tweet has since been deleted  and said: \"Good morning Roseanne - my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soross nephews are lovely people. Im just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day!\"\nOpen Society Foundations is a philanthropic organization founded by Soros.\nClinton married her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, whose name was misspelled in the Facebook post, in July 2010. Reuters reported that the only high profile guests seen in the town where they married other than former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under Bill Clinton, actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, and fashion designer Vera Wang.\nMezvinsky is an investment banker and the son of Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, both former Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nSearching the Nexis database for anything involving the couple, George Soros, and the word \"nephew,\" we found 35 news stories. They were all about Roseanne Barrs allegation that Clinton is married to Soross nephew. And they didnt corroborate her claim.\nWe couldnt find any evidence to lend credence to this Facebook post. We rate it Pants on Fire!",

    "explanation": "The internal check and the external check both strongly agree that the caption \"Chelsea Clinton is married to George Soros' nephew\" is out of context with respect to the provided image. The image shows George Soros, but there is no mention of Chelsea Clinton or her marriage.  The internal check has a confidence score of 0 because the image only shows George Soros, while the caption mentions Chelsea Clinton and her marital status, creating a clear mismatch. The external check achieves a confidence score of 10 based on multiple sources (like Politifact) that debunk the claim about Chelsea Clinton's marriage.  These sources provide concrete evidence that refutes the claim, including Chelsea Clinton's personal denial. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both point towards the caption being completely false and unrelated to the image's content. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the overwhelming evidence against the caption's accuracy and its clear mismatch with the image.  The external check's strong evidence further reinforces the internal check's assessment that the caption is indeed completely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively confirm that the caption is out of context.  The image features George Soros, while the caption falsely claims Chelsea Clinton is married to his nephew.  External sources offer strong evidence disproving the false claim."

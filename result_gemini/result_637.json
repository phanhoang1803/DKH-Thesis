      "explanation": "Facial recognition systems are increasingly used in schools for security purposes, although their implementation is often controversial due to privacy concerns.  While I cannot definitively verify this specific instance for Lockport High School without further evidence, the scenario is plausible based on current trends in school security technology.  The claim is neither inherently false nor easily verifiable without access to official school statements or news reports.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the accuracy of the caption regarding the image's depiction of Lockport High School. However, the external check, while not disproving the caption, expresses lower confidence (7) due to the lack of readily available public information confirming the implementation of a facial recognition system at the school.  The discrepancy stems from the fact that the image provides visual confirmation of the school's location, but the claim about facial recognition technology requires external verification which is unavailable from the given context.  The external check acknowledges the plausibility of schools using facial recognition but emphasizes the need for independent evidence.  The image shows only the building's exterior and provides no information about security measures. Therefore, while the image is accurately identified, the claim about the facial recognition system lacks the necessary supporting evidence.  The higher confidence from the internal check is focused solely on the image itself (location and school identity) and does not address the claim concerning the technology.  The external check is more concerned with the unverifiable nature of that claim.  We are heavily influenced by the external check in this scenario because the core claim of the caption is that Lockport High School uses facial recognition.  The lack of external verification for this specific claim makes the caption potentially out of context despite its visual accuracy. Because there is no supporting evidence for the facial recognition aspect of the caption, and such evidence is needed to support the caption's primary assertion, we conclude that the caption is out of context given the existing evidence. In short, the image shows Lockport High School, but that doesn't mean it uses facial recognition.  The external check appropriately highlights this critical distinction.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the image identification but not the claim regarding facial recognition technology. External validation confirms the plausibility of the claim but lacks sufficient evidence to definitively verify it. The final assessment is based on the lack of evidence for the core claim of the caption, leading to a conclusion of it being out of context."

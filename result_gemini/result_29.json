        "content": "More than 300 schoolboys have been reunited with their families, a week after they were kidnapped from their school in north-west Nigeria.\nThe boys arrived by bus in Katsina, capital of the state of the same name, where they were met by President Muhammadu Buhari.\nLooking weary, some were still wearing their school uniforms, while others clutched grey blankets.\nState authorities now say the children were abducted by local bandits.\nJihadist militant group Boko Haram had claimed to have been behind the mass kidnapping but some experts were sceptical because it occurred well outside their normal area of operations.\nAccording to Governor Aminu Bello Masari, 344 boys were freed but others remain missing.\nThey were abducted on 11 December in an attack on a school in the town of Kankara.\nHow were the boys greeted?\nFlanked by armed police, the boys walked in single file from the buses to a government building to meet President Buhari and the governor. They were also due to undergo medical checks.\nParents were overjoyed to be reunited with their sons. \"I couldn't believe what I heard until neighbours came to inform me that it's true,\" one mother told Reuters news agency.\n\"I'm so excited,\" said another mother who been waiting anxiously with other parents after seeing her boy, 15. \"I have to cry, the cry of joy when I saw him,\" she told AFP news agency.\nOne boy told a TV station the group had been fed bread and cassava during their captivity and that it had been cold. He said he was \"really happy\" to be back in Katsina.\nAddressing the freed children, Governor Masari said: \"You suffered physically, mentally and psychologically, but let me assure you that we suffered more and your parents suffered more.\"\nEarlier he had told media: \"I think we have recovered most of the boys- it's not all of them.\"\nHow was the release secured?\nThe government insists no ransom was paid but that the boys were released after negotiations with the kidnappers.\nZamfara state governor Bello Matawalle, in whose state the boys were released, told the BBC that three separate negotiations had taken place before the students' freedom was secured.\nThey were released in Tsafe town in Zamfara on Thursday evening, authorities say.\nMr Matawalle told BBC Hausa that during the negotiations the kidnappers had raised various grievances.\n\"Among their complaints was how people kill their cattle and how various vigilante units disturb them,\" the governor said, adding that the government had promised to look into the complaints of the kidnappers.\nConflict between herders and farming communities are common in Nigeria's central and north-western states, says the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Lagos.\nBoth groups have been warring for decades but deadly clashes have increased in recent years as farming communities and herdsmen have employed armed vigilantes, especially in Nigeria's north-west.\nA spokesman for Governor Masari, Abdul Labaran, told the BBC the boys had been held by bandits.\n\"It wasn't Boko Haram,\" he said. \"The local bandits we know about all along were responsible. These are people we know very well, I met some of their leaders. That is why an umbrella body of cattle breeders' association was used in contacting them. So the negotiation was made through this umbrella body of cattle breeders.\"\nHow did the school attack unfold?\nWitnesses say armed men raided the school in Kankara last Friday evening. Many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots.\nSome were tracked by the gunmen, who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once these students were rounded up, they were marched into the nearby forest by the armed men.\nOn Thursday, video was released bearing Boko Haram's emblem, showing dozens of boys, some of whom appeared to be very young.\nOne of the boys said they had been taken captive by \"the gang of Abu Shekau\". Abubakar Shekau leads Boko Haram, a group notorious for school kidnappings, including one in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized.",

The description states: \"Flanked by armed police, the boys walked in single file from the buses to a government building to meet President Buhari and the governor.\"  While the caption mentions the kidnapping itself, the evidence focuses on the return of the boys.  The number of children also matches the range mentioned in the article (more than 300). The location (Katsina state, northern Nigeria) is also consistent.",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the caption's claim that police patrolled a school in Katsina state, Nigeria, where a kidnapping event involving more than 300 children occurred.  However, the confidence score is lowered due to the fact that the internal check notes a lack of direct visual evidence within the image confirming the specific location and the kidnapping incident. While the image depicts police officers in what appears to be an African setting, it doesn't offer definitive visual proof linking it directly to the Katsina state school and the mass kidnapping event.  The external validation, relying on a source mentioning police presence while the boys returned after the kidnapping, corroborates the police presence at a location relevant to the event. The external source is strong enough to overcome the uncertainty in the internal check. Nevertheless,  the image itself doesn't explicitly show the aftermath of the kidnapping or provide clear contextual clues to definitively confirm the caption. Therefore, while the caption is likely true based on the combination of checks, there's insufficient visual evidence in the image alone to support the caption's claim fully.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption but with different confidence levels. Internal check highlights insufficient visual confirmation in the image, while external check strengthens the overall confidence by pointing to a source corroborating the police presence around the event. The overall confidence is lowered slightly due to lack of definitive visual evidence in the image itself."

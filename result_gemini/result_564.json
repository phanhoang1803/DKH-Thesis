Post-Brexit trade negotiations were a significant issue during that period, and high-level meetings between the two were common. While I cannot independently verify the specific meeting mentioned, the scenario described aligns with the known political context and the roles of the individuals involved.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check exhibits high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy, asserting that the image aligns perfectly with the described meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels, supported by the presence of the UK and EU flags.  The external check also shows strong confidence (score 8), confirming the plausibility of the caption based on the known historical context: Johnson's premiership, von der Leyen's role, and the significant post-Brexit trade negotiations.  While the external check can't independently verify the exact date or details of this specific meeting, the broader context strongly suggests such a meeting did take place.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both support the accuracy of the caption, although the external validation acknowledges the limitation of not being able to confirm the meeting with absolute certainty.  The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the strong alignment of entities and events, lead to a high overall confidence score of 9 for the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy.  High confidence scores (10 and 8) and consistent findings indicate a strong likelihood that the caption accurately describes the depicted meeting."

      "explanation": "Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Africa, and Kenya has a healthcare system.  Medical workers in affected areas would plausibly wear protective equipment during an outbreak. While I don't have specific knowledge of a particular Kenyan Ebola outbreak matching this caption, the scenario is realistic.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's claim that the image depicts Kenyan medical workers in protective gear during an Ebola outbreak. The internal check highlights the strong visual cues in the image—protective suits, a body bag (suggesting a deceased patient)—consistent with an infectious disease outbreak response. While Ebola isn't explicitly mentioned, the context strongly suggests a serious disease outbreak requiring such protective measures. The external check reinforces this by noting that Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Africa, including regions near Kenya, making the scenario plausible. The standard practice of using protective equipment during outbreaks further corroborates the caption's assertion.  Both checks have high confidence scores (10 internally, 8 externally), suggesting a strong alignment between the image content and the caption. There are no significant discrepancies. While definitive proof of a specific Kenyan Ebola outbreak matching this image is lacking, the combination of visual context and knowledge of disease outbreak response protocols provides sufficient evidence to support the caption's claim. The confidence score is slightly lowered from a perfect 10 because of the lack of explicit mention of Ebola in the image; however, the circumstantial evidence strongly suggests the scenario presented in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy. Visual evidence in the image, along with knowledge about infectious disease outbreak response and the possibility of Ebola outbreaks in the region, provide strong support. The lack of explicit mention of Ebola in the image is the only minor weakness, resulting in a slightly reduced confidence score."

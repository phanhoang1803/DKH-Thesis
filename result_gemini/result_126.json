        "content": "Claim:\nIn July 2017, Don Moen died of \"stomach pain\".\nOn 12 July 2017, the HoustonChronicle-TV web site published an entirely fake story, reporting that American gospel singer and pastor Don Moen had died after a \"short illness\":\nAmerican singer-songwriter, Evangelist Don Moen has died after [a] short battle with stomach pain. His family confirmed that he died early this morning at General Acute Care (GAC) Hospital in California barely [a] couple of hours after he was rushed to the hospital.\nThe article is riddled with errors and fabrications, such as California's \"General Acute Care Hospital\", which does not exist, and a fake tribute from President Donald Trump. Moen's collaborator  Nigerian Christian Contemporary music artist Frank Edwards  confirmed the report is a hoax, tweeting a screenshot of a text message sent by Moen's son Michael, who wrote:\nDad is great and it good health. That article is false and just trying to get people to click thru [sic] to their website. I'll have dad post something on social media shortly so people know.\nOn the day the fake article was published, Moen posted to Facebook.\nThe story itself contains several hallmarks of being fake: an invented hospital; a dubious cause of death (\"stomach pain\") is followed by the contradictory claim that the cause of death was \"not immediately known\"; a quote from Donald Trump is not attributed to any source; a quote from the pastor T.D. Jakes is attributed to \"local media\" but no specific source is named.\nHoustonChronicle-TV.com is not in any way associated with the Houston Chronicle newspaper.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check incorrectly asserts that the caption accurately reflects the image, giving a confidence score of 10. However, the external check definitively refutes the caption's claim of Don Moen's death, providing strong evidence from Snopes.com that the death report was a hoax.  The external check's confidence score is also 10. The discrepancy arises from a failure of the internal check to verify the caption's claim against reliable external sources. The external check's evidence is significantly more robust, including a detailed analysis of the fake news report and confirmation from Moen's family.  The internal check's reliance on visual identification alone is insufficient to verify the factuality of a claim involving a public figure's death.  Therefore, the external evidence strongly outweighs the internal assessment, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence scores from both checks, when considered in light of the discrepancy, reinforce the reliability of the external validation. The final assessment is based on the preponderance of evidence, favoring the reliable external source that directly debunks the false report of Don Moen's death.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check incorrectly validated the caption. External check strongly refutes the caption's claim using reliable sources, showing the caption is out of context."

      "explanation": "The statement is plausible given the history of political unrest and human rights concerns in Nicaragua.  Nicaraguan refugees in neighboring countries, such as Costa Rica, often protest against the Nicaraguan government's actions. Holding pictures of those killed or imprisoned is a common way to symbolize this protest and to memorialize victims. However, without specific details about the time period and the event referenced, it's difficult to fully verify. The caption could be referring to a specific protest or a general situation that may have occurred repeatedly.",
      "supporting_points": "The political situation in Nicaragua has involved significant human rights abuses and political repression leading to a large number of Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica. Public protests and demonstrations, including symbolic actions like displaying pictures of victims, are common ways to express dissent.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The caption \"Nicaraguans in Costa Rica hold pictures of people killed in riots or imprisoned\" aligns well with the image content and historical context.  The internal check finds strong support for the caption's accuracy because the image clearly shows Nicaraguans (identifiable through flags and context) holding pictures of individuals, presumably victims of violence or imprisonment, in what seems to be Costa Rica. The flags and setting suggest that this is a protest related to Nicaragua. The external check corroborates this assessment, noting that the political situation in Nicaragua has led to numerous human rights violations and a large refugee population in Costa Rica. Protests by Nicaraguan refugees, often involving the display of pictures of victims, are common forms of expressing dissent against the Nicaraguan government.  While the external check's confidence score (7) is slightly lower than the internal check's (10), it still supports the caption's validity.  Both checks agree that the caption is not out of context. The slightly lower confidence score from the external check is due to a lack of specific details about the exact event depicted in the image; however, it is plausible given the ongoing political and social dynamics in Nicaragua and the situation of Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica.  There are no discrepancies between internal and external checks; both independently support the caption's accuracy. The high confidence score (8) reflects the strong combined evidence from both the image analysis and the external knowledge of the socio-political circumstances in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  The explanation provided addresses the slightly lower confidence in the external check by acknowledging the lack of specific details about the time and event, but emphasizes that the caption remains plausible given the established historical context. In summary, both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's description of the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption. The internal check highlights the image's clear depiction of Nicaraguans holding pictures of victims in what seems to be Costa Rica. The external check cites the ongoing human rights concerns and political instability in Nicaragua, making such protests by Nicaraguan refugees plausible.  The combined evidence leads to high confidence in the caption's accuracy."

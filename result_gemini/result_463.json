However, the caption is slightly inaccurate in stating that the movie is called \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\" The image confirms that Radcliffe is involved in the play's adaptation, which would likely be a movie. The discrepancies in the movie's name between the caption and the visual content slightly reduce the confidence score. ",

Furthermore, no official announcements were made on 1 April 2018 about Daniel Radcliffe's return to the series, nor is any upcoming movie called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child or any derivation thereof in the works.\nHowever, this particular hoax was easier to believe, because it does have some basis in fact. A play by the same name, which is based on a short story written by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne (who also wrote the play) has run in London since 2016, and opens on Broadway in April 2018.\nSome Facebook pages have this poster presented as if it is genuine; others have admitted that this movie news was nothing more than a hoax:\nThe fan-made poster has been around since at least December 2017. It appears to have been created by someone who goes by \"BlueWolfArtista,\" and it was originally shared with tags such as \"concept art\" and \"photomanipulation.\" The image of the cursed child was created by altering a still shot of actor Asa Butterfield from the movie Ender's Game:\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a legitimate play, but whether it will become a movie remains to be seen  and it's a good bet that if it does, the announcement won't be made on 1 April.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows some alignment between the caption and the image, indicating a potential connection between Daniel Radcliffe and a movie adaptation of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\" However, the external validation check decisively refutes the caption's claim, citing a Snopes article that exposes the announcement as an April Fool's Day hoax.  The high confidence score of the external check (10) outweighs the lower confidence score of the internal check (8), leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The discrepancy between the two checks arises from the fact that the internal check relies only on the visual content and general knowledge about the play and movie adaptations whereas the external check uses reliable, fact-checked information from Snopes, making it more credible.  The entity analysis aligns with the external check since the claim of Daniel Radcliffe's involvement in the movie adaptation mentioned in the caption is false according to credible sources. Thus, based on the overwhelming evidence provided by the external check validated by entity analysis, we can confidently conclude that the caption is out of context. The image does show Daniel Radcliffe and another actor in a scene that could be from an adaptation of the play, however, this visual information does not replace the verifiable fact that the announcement in the caption was a hoax. Therefore, while the image might seem to support the caption superficially, it cannot override the concrete evidence presented by Snopes that explicitly debunks the caption's core claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially supports the caption's claim based on the visual content, while the external check definitively refutes the claim, identifying it as a hoax.  The external evidence is more reliable and leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

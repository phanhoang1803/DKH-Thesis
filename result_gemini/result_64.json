      "confidence_score": 7,
      "explanation": "The Great Belt Bridge is a real structure in Denmark, and train accidents, while hopefully infrequent, are unfortunately possible anywhere.  The plausibility hinges on whether a train accident of sufficient magnitude to necessitate a rescue effort has actually occurred on the Great Belt Bridge.  Without further information (news reports, official statements etc.) it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. Thus, the verdict is plausible but uncertain.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score of 10, strongly supporting the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The scene depicts a train accident, rescue workers, and a location consistent with a bridge.  The external validation, while acknowledging the plausibility of the event (train accidents on the Great Belt Bridge are possible), gives a lower confidence score of 7 due to a lack of definitive proof.  No news articles or official reports are provided to confirm the specific incident.  However, the external check does not contradict the internal assessment; rather, it highlights the need for further verification. The discrepancy between the confidence scores arises from the difference between visual evidence (internal check) and lack of corroborating external evidence (external check). The image strongly suggests a train accident with rescue workers, making it highly plausible.  The absence of external confirmation doesn't negate the visual evidence, but it lowers the overall confidence score.  Considering the strong internal support and the plausible external context, the caption is considered not out of context.  The final confidence score reflects a balance between the high confidence in the visual evidence and the need for external verification to definitively confirm the specific event mentioned in the caption (the exact accident on the Great Belt Bridge).  More evidence would be needed to increase the confidence to a score of 10.  In the absence of additional information, the visual context and the known existence of the Great Belt Bridge make the caption believable.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption (confidence 10), aligning with the image content. External validation is plausible (confidence 7) but lacks definitive proof of the specific accident described. The final assessment balances these, concluding the caption is likely accurate, with a reduced confidence score due to the lack of external confirmation."

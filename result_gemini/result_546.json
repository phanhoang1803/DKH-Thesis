      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  The Duchess of Cambridge has been involved in photography projects and collaborations with the National Portrait Gallery. The existence of a digital exhibition called \"Hold Still\" and the involvement of a photographer named Wendy Huson would need to be verified through reputable sources like the National Portrait Gallery's website or press releases from Kensington Palace. The description aligns with the kind of announcements one might expect from such collaborations. However, without independent verification, the claim remains somewhat uncertain.",
      "supporting_points": "Duchess of Cambridge's public engagements often involve photography and art; National Portrait Gallery frequently collaborates on exhibitions;  'Hold Still' sounds like a plausible exhibition title; Wendy Huson could be a real photographer.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 1,
    "explanation": "The internal consistency check reveals a complete mismatch between the image content and the caption description. The image shows a postal worker and a person in a turkey costume, while the caption describes a handout from Kensington Palace related to a photography exhibition.  There is no visual overlap between the two. The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of some aspects of the caption (Duchess of Cambridge's involvement in photography, potential for a collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, the possibility of a 'Hold Still' exhibition), lacks concrete evidence to support the claim. The absence of verifiable links between the image and the entities mentioned in the caption significantly weakens the external validation. The confidence score from the external check is significantly lower than the internal check, primarily because external verification is still uncertain even if the named entities are all valid and plausible. The high discrepancy between internal and external checks, combined with the lack of verifiable evidence to support the caption, leads to a strong conclusion that the caption is completely out of context with respect to the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly rejects the caption due to a complete mismatch between image and description. External check finds the caption plausible but lacks concrete evidence. The significant conflict and lack of evidence lead to a confident conclusion that the caption is out of context."

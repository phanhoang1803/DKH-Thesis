(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

      "explanation": "The claim that photographs show icebergs with multi-colored striping taken in Lake Michigan is directly addressed and debunked by Source 1.  Source 1 explicitly states that while photographs of icebergs with multi-colored striping exist, they were NOT taken in Lake Michigan. The source traces the misattribution of these photos to Lake Michigan and details their actual origin in waters near Cape Town, South Africa. The evidence clearly refutes the claim in the caption.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check identifies a discrepancy: the image depicts icebergs, but their location is not Lake Michigan.  The confidence score of 1 reflects this internal inconsistency.  The external check provides substantial evidence refuting the caption's claim. It cites a source that explicitly debunks the misattribution of these iceberg photographs to Lake Michigan, tracing their origin to waters near Cape Town, South Africa. The external check's high confidence score of 10 reflects the clear and decisive evidence presented in this source. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently confirm that the caption's statement is inaccurate. The high confidence score of 10 in the final output reflects the strong agreement between the two checks and the substantial evidence from the external source. The combined evidence leaves no room for doubt that the caption is out of context and misrepresents the location of the icebergs depicted in the photograph.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm that the caption is inaccurate. The image shows icebergs, but not in Lake Michigan. External evidence definitively places the icebergs near Cape Town, South Africa."

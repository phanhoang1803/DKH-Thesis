        "content": "Claim:\nIn late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed whereby motorists were tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the road, as part of a prevalent sex-trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Yall See Anything Like This, Dont Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Dont Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim made in the news caption.  The caption states that in late 2019, a pattern of incidents existed where motorists were tricked into stopping by people lying in the road as a sex trafficking tactic in Tampa, Florida.  Snopes investigated this claim and found it to be false.  Law enforcement agencies in Tampa and Florida stated they had no reports of such incidents.  The Snopes investigation found the claim originated from widely shared social media posts with no evidence to support the alleged pattern of incidents.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no evidence within the image to support the claim made in the caption.  The image simply depicts a person lying on a road at night near a car. There is no information about the location (Tampa, Florida), the timeframe (late 2019), or the involvement of sex trafficking. The internal check's confidence score is 0, indicating a complete lack of support from the image content.\n\nThe external check corroborates this assessment.  It references a Snopes article that thoroughly investigates the claim presented in the caption. The Snopes investigation concludes that the claim about a pattern of incidents in Tampa, Florida, using people lying in the road as a sex-trafficking tactic in late 2019, is false.  Law enforcement agencies in the area reported no such incidents. The claim's origin is traced to unsubstantiated social media posts. The external check's confidence score is 10, signifying strong evidence refuting the caption's claim.\n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. Both methods independently and strongly indicate that the caption is out of context with the provided image. The image shows a person lying on a road, but this image alone offers no verifiable connection to the specific claim of a sex-trafficking tactic used in Tampa, Florida, during late 2019.  The high confidence score from the external check (10) is further reinforced by the lack of any supporting evidence from the image itself (internal check confidence score of 0).\n\nTherefore, based on the combined, consistent, and highly confident results from both internal and external validation, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is definitive and highly reliable. There is no evidence within the image to suggest the depicted scene relates to the described sex-trafficking incidents in Tampa, and a reputable fact-checking source explicitly refutes the claim.\n\nIn summary, the image provides no contextual clues supporting the caption's assertion, and an independent investigation confirms the claim's falsity, leading to a conclusive determination of the caption being out of context.",

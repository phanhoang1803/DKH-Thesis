      "explanation": "Mike Pompeo, as a former Secretary of State, has a history of giving addresses and speeches at various universities and international forums.  American University in Cairo is a prominent institution, making such a visit plausible. While I don't have access to a real-time database of his appearances, the scenario is entirely believable based on his past activities and the nature of the location.  Therefore, I rate it as plausible, though I cannot definitively confirm it without external verification of event records.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The caption \"Mike Pompeo addresses students at the American University in Cairo\" aligns well with the provided image. The internal check exhibits high confidence (10) due to the clear visibility of Mike Pompeo and the university's logo on the podium.  The external check also shows considerable confidence (8), acknowledging the plausibility of Pompeo speaking at such an institution based on his past activities.  However, it lacks definitive proof from event records.  The discrepancy is minor, as the external check's uncertainty stems from the lack of access to specific event records, not from any contradicting evidence.  Both checks agree on the core premise: the image depicts Pompeo at the American University in Cairo. Given the strong visual evidence and the reasonable external plausibility, the overall confidence is high (9). There is no indication that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check is highly confident due to clear visual evidence, while the external check, though lacking definitive proof, finds the scenario plausible based on Pompeo's public speaking history and the university's prominence."

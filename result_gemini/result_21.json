      "explanation": "Martin Fayulu was a prominent opposition leader in the Democratic Republic of Congo and did contest the 2018 presidential election.  While the exact details of his demands might require further verification from reliable news sources covering the election at that time, it is plausible that he demanded a recount given the controversies surrounding the results. Therefore, the statement is considered factually plausible.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check highlights the presence of Martin Fayulu in the image, aligning with the caption's claim.  However, it acknowledges a lack of definitive visual evidence directly supporting the recount demand. The external check confirms Fayulu's prominent role as an opposition leader in the 2018 DRC election and the plausibility of him demanding a recount given the circumstances.  Both checks agree on the core fact of Fayulu's identity and role, which is the main subject of the caption.  The discrepancy lies in the detail about the recount demand, where the image itself provides no direct visual evidence.  Therefore, while the image doesn't explicitly show a recount demand, the external context makes it plausible and strongly suggests the caption is not out of context. The overall confidence is high due to the strong alignment on the primary subject (Fayulu's identity and role) and the plausible external context supporting the secondary claim (recount demand).",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check verifies Fayulu's presence; external check confirms his role and the plausibility of the recount demand.  Discrepancy exists on visual evidence for the recount demand, but external context strongly supports the caption."

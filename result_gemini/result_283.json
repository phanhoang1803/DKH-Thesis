However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a significant mismatch between the caption and the image content. The image depicts a massive rally, likely in Cuba, given the architectural style of the buildings and the overall setting.  The caption, \"Just a Bernie Sanders rally in California,\" is factually incorrect.  The internal check has a confidence score of 1, reflecting the clear discrepancy.  The external check, while revealing the existence of multiple large Bernie Sanders rallies in California, does not support the claim that the *specific image* depicts one of them.  The external check's confidence score of 8 is based on the confirmed occurrence of the rallies, but it doesn't address the visual content of the image in question. The high confidence score of 8 in the external check is based on the proven existence of large Bernie Sanders rallies in California and their extensive news coverage; however, this does not validate the caption's claim about the *specific image*. There's no evidence linking this particular image to any of the documented California rallies. The external check's support for the existence of large Bernie Sanders rallies in California is irrelevant to whether this specific image shows one of those events. Therefore, the significant visual difference between the image and the description in the caption, supported by strong internal validation, outweighs the confirmation of separate, unrelated events mentioned in external sources.  The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the direct visual evidence over indirect information about separate events.  The image clearly shows a rally in a location visually dissimilar to California, ruling out the caption's claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly rejects the caption (confidence 1), identifying a location mismatch. External check confirms large California Bernie Sanders rallies (confidence 8) but doesn't link them to the image.  Visual evidence prioritizes internal validation, resulting in a high confidence that the caption is out of context."

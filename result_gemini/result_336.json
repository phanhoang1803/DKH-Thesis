While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

The provided evidence from Snopes explicitly states that the photographs circulating online of a purple lobster caught in Maine are digitally manipulated and fake.  The fact-check article details how the images originated from a Facebook group as a joke, but were subsequently shared and misinterpreted as real by news outlets.  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably false.",

    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the caption's alignment with the image, finding no apparent conflict.  The image depicts a purple lobster, and the caption mentions a purple lobster caught in Maine.  The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10 because the image and caption appear consistent at face value. However, the external check contradicts this assessment. It reveals that the image of the purple lobster is digitally manipulated and not a genuine photograph of a lobster caught in Maine.  The external check provides evidence from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, which directly refutes the claim in the caption. The fact-checking article meticulously traces the image's origin to a Facebook joke and clarifies that news outlets misinterpreted it. The external check also provides a high confidence score of 10, grounded in the detailed evidence presented by Snopes. This strong external evidence directly challenges the internal assessment, leading to a final conclusion that the caption is out of context. The conflict between the high-confidence scores from both checks underscores the importance of external verification. The internal check, relying solely on superficial image-caption alignment, missed the crucial fact that the image was digitally altered.  The external check, by employing reliable sources, effectively revealed the hoax, significantly improving the accuracy of the overall assessment.  Therefore, the final verdict reflects the external validation's conclusive proof, despite the initial internal consistency.  The high confidence score (10) in the final assessment is justified by the robust evidence from the external fact-check, which outweighs the internal check's limited perspective. In summary, relying solely on internal consistency can be misleading. Thorough external verification is crucial to obtain an accurate assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found no conflict between the image and caption (confidence: 10).  External check, using Snopes, revealed the image to be digitally manipulated, contradicting the caption (confidence: 10).  The final verdict is that the caption is out of context due to the conclusive external evidence."

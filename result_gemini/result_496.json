The caption mentions President Biden's motorcade, but the image provides no information regarding any interaction between the soldiers and a motorcade.

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows members of the National Guard turning their backs on U.S. President Joe Biden's motorcade.\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, there was a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. In the days that followed, as preparations were being made for the inauguration of President Joe Biden on Jan. 20, about 20,000 members of the National Guard were deployed to Washington, D.C., to provide security for the event.\nAs Biden's inauguration was underway, a video started circulating on social media that some, such as the conspiratorial InfoWars, claimed showed members of the National Guard intentionally turning their backs on Biden's motorcade as a sign of disrespect.\nThis video does not show members of the National Guard intentionally turning their backs on Biden's motorcade.\nThe claim that these National Guardsmen were turning their backs on Biden's motorcade is based on the presumption that members of the military should, at all times, stand at attention in the presence of the commander-in-chief. But that's not the case. In this video, for instance, these members of the United States military are on duty to protect the president against potential threats. In order to do so, some are facing away from the street, while others are facing toward the motorcade.\nA spokesperson for the National Guard told us: These National Guardsmen were on duty with a mission to protect the president against potential threats. Some are facing out to ensure the safety of all.\nIn other words, this video does not show any disrespectful behavior. The National Guardsmen in this video were simply performing their duties to ensure the safety of everyone in attendance at Biden's inauguration.\nThe claim that this video shows members of the military turning their backs on the president is based on solely on the thirdhand interpretations of social media users. No members of the National Guard have stated that they turned their backs on the motorcade, no credible news outlets have filed such reports, nor has the National Guard released any statements admonishing members of the military for showcasing disrespect for their commander-in-chief.\nIt should also be noted that Biden's motorcade consisted of dozens of vehicles. While we don't have a precise count, the automotive news site The Drive described the motorcade as \"absolutely massive,\" consisting of seven \"Beasts,\" the nickname for the heavily armored presidential limo, to transport Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George Bush. Several other SUVs, limos, and police and military escort vehicles were also in the motorcade.\nAn absolutely massive motorcade took President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, along with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, among others, around the greater Washington, D.C. area after the inauguration today. At one point, at least seven heavily armored and otherwise custom-built presidential limousines, commonly known as \"Beasts,\" together with an armada of other armored SUV limousines and supporting vehicles, took part in the procession.\nLastly, while the vantage point of this video is still a bit unclear, it certainly did not originate from Biden's vehicle. This video was posted by ABC News reporter Ines de La Cuetara, along with the caption: \"The view from Bidens motorcade as it made its way up to the Capitol.\" La Cuetara, who was presumably in a vehicle near the rear of the motorcade  as she is a reporter, not a politician  made no mention of the National Guard turning their backs on Biden.\nHere's the original video:",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes directly addresses the claim in the news caption.  Snopes investigates the claim that National Guard members turned their backs on Biden's motorcade and concludes that the claim is false.  The explanation provided is that the guardsmen were performing their duties, positioned to ensure safety, not showing disrespect.  The Snopes article also cites a spokesperson from the National Guard supporting this interpretation. Therefore, the evidence strongly refutes the news caption.",

    "explanation": "The internal check expresses uncertainty about the caption's accuracy due to insufficient visual information. It correctly points out that the image alone does not confirm the soldiers' identity as National Guard members nor their actions as turning their backs on President Biden's motorcade.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, directly addresses the claim and conclusively refutes it.  Snopes cites a National Guard spokesperson who explains that the soldiers were performing their duties, focused on safety and security, and not displaying any disrespect. This external evidence significantly outweighs the uncertainty from the internal check. The high confidence score (8) from the external check and the corroborating explanation solidify the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; the internal check highlights the limitations of the image, while the external check offers compelling evidence to refute the claim. The alignment of the analysis is consistent: both sources indicate the caption is inaccurate. The evidence from Snopes is strong and reliable, providing a definitive answer. Therefore, based on the combined evidence, the caption is deemed out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check highlights the image's limitations in confirming the caption's details, while the external check presents strong evidence from a reliable fact-checking source (Snopes) refuting the claim."

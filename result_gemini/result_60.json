      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Sheep are known to roam freely in rural areas, and it's not entirely uncommon for animals to wander into unusual places.  The location mentioned, North Harris in Scotland, is a rural area where sheep are common. Therefore, finding a sheep in a bus shelter in such a setting does not seem impossible. However, the claim lacks specific verifiability; without a photo or other corroborating evidence, it remains anecdotal.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check flags uncertainty about the location and the photographer, Gill Mackintosh, due to a lack of explicit information in the image itself.  The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario, points out the lack of specific verifiable evidence to confirm the exact location and the photographer's claim. Both checks converge on the lack of definitive proof, leaning toward the caption being potentially out of context because of this lack of verifiability. Although a sheep in a bus shelter in a remote area is not implausible, the absence of evidence linking the image definitively to the claimed location and photographer lowers the confidence score. The external check's high confidence stems from the plausibility of a sheep ending up in a bus shelter in a rural Scottish area, a point that doesn't address the missing verification needed to confirm the image's provenance and the caption's accuracy. The internal check's uncertainty about Gill Mackintosh and the specific location, combined with the external check's inability to provide concrete verification of the claim, pushes the overall assessment towards 'out of context'. The absence of any timestamp, other identifying information, or corroborating evidence leaves substantial room for doubt, leading to a conservative confidence score of 8.  A higher confidence would demand concrete evidence from reliable sources to firmly establish the link between the image, the claimed location, and the photographer.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree on the lack of sufficient evidence to fully verify the caption, with the internal check highlighting missing entities and the external check emphasizing the absence of concrete proof, resulting in a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 4,
      "explanation": "The news caption is plausible.  It's a simple statement that a community chairperson made an appeal.  However, without further context or verification, it's difficult to confirm the specific details (the chairperson's name, age, exact date, the nature of the appeal).  There is nothing inherently implausible, but the lack of readily available corroborating information lowers the confidence score.",
      "supporting_points": "General knowledge about community chairpersons and news reporting.  The format of the caption resembles typical news briefs.",
      "verdict": true

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (8) in the caption's accuracy because the image visually supports the description of a community chairperson addressing residents. The megaphone and the man's attire are consistent with this scenario. However, the external check displays a lower confidence score (4) due to the absence of readily available external evidence corroborating the specific details mentioned in the caption, such as the chairperson's name, age, and the exact date and nature of the appeal. Although the caption is plausible and structurally similar to news briefs, the lack of easily accessible verification lowers the confidence.  There is no direct conflict between the checks, only a difference in confidence levels stemming from the types of evidence considered. The internal check relies on visual consistency, while the external check focuses on external verification and source credibility.  Weighing both, a moderate confidence score of 6 is assigned.  The absence of independent verification necessitates a degree of caution, limiting the overall certainty about the caption's complete accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on visual alignment, while the external check displays moderate confidence due to the lack of external corroboration.  A balanced assessment yields a moderate confidence in the caption's accuracy."

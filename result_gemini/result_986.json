    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the clear depiction of a passenger train accident in the image. The external check, while also supporting the caption's plausibility (verdict: True), provides a lower confidence score (7) due to the lack of specific details like the exact location in Denmark and the absence of news sources confirming the accident. The discrepancy stems from the difference in the information available to each check: the internal check directly analyzes the image's content, while the external check relies on general knowledge and the plausibility of the scenario.  Both checks agree that the image shows a passenger train involved in an accident, the number of passengers is plausible, and the location in Denmark is geographically possible. However, the absence of additional verifying information leads to a slightly reduced overall confidence score.  The external check highlights this absence of specific details, such as confirming news sources or the date of the accident. This points towards the fact that while the image and general knowledge align with the caption, a lack of corroborating evidence prevents us from reaching absolute certainty. In weighing the evidence, the overall confidence score is adjusted downward to reflect this uncertainty, resulting in a score of 8. Although the image strongly suggests the caption is accurate, the lack of external verification remains a significant consideration.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports caption accuracy (confidence 10), while external check shows moderate support (confidence 7) due to a lack of specific details and corroborating evidence.  The final confidence score reflects this uncertainty."

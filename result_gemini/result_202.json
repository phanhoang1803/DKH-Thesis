While Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were sworn in on January 20, 2021, there is no verifiable evidence or reporting from reputable news sources to support the claim that Vice President Harris threatened to use federal law enforcement and the military against Trump supporters.  Such a statement would have been widely reported and would be easily verifiable. The absence of such reporting strongly suggests the claim is false.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The caption's claim is factually incorrect and completely misrepresents the image.  Internal validation reveals a significant mismatch between the image content (Biden signing a document) and the caption's description (Harris threatening Trump supporters). The image shows President Biden alone, engaged in an act of official business; neither Vice President Harris nor any mention of 'Trumpers' or threats are visually present. The internal check's low confidence score of 7 reflects this discrepancy. \n\nExternal validation definitively refutes the caption's central claim.  Reputable news sources provide no evidence of Vice President Harris making the statement attributed to her.  The absence of any credible reporting, coupled with the inflammatory and unsubstantiated nature of the quote, strongly suggests fabrication. The external check's high confidence score of 10 underscores the complete lack of supporting evidence for the claim.\n\nThere is no conflict between internal and external checks; both independently demonstrate the caption's inaccuracy.  The entity analysis aligns with this conclusion: Biden is present in the image, but Harris, Trump, and the alleged threat are entirely absent from both the visual context and verifiable news records.  The high confidence level (10) in the external check, corroborated by the low confidence (7) in the internal check, overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context. The caption presents a false narrative about a statement purportedly made by Harris and bears no relation to the depicted event of President Biden signing a document.  In summary, all lines of evidence converge to demonstrate that the caption is fundamentally false and bears no relation to the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the provided caption is entirely out of context. The image depicts President Biden alone, signing a document, while the caption falsely describes a threat allegedly made by Vice President Harris against Trump supporters.  External verification confirms the absence of any credible reporting to support the claim made in the caption."

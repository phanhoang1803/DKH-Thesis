Gillian Cowie could be a person who took the photograph. However, without further verification (e.g., confirming the existence of a specific 'Glen' near Whitebridge and verifying Gillian Cowie's photography), the claim remains plausible but not definitively verifiable.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The caption states that the image of a royal stag was captured by Gillian Cowie near Whitebridge in the Highlands.  Both internal and external checks find this plausible but not definitively verifiable.  The internal check notes that the image depicts a stag in a glen-like setting at night, consistent with the caption's description. However, precise location identification (Glen, Whitebridge) and verification of the photographer's identity are not possible based solely on the image. The external check supports the plausibility of the claim. Red deer stags are found in the Scottish Highlands, making the location plausible. Names like \"Glen\" and \"Whitebridge\" sound like plausible locations in Scotland, and Gillian Cowie could reasonably be a photographer. However, the lack of independently verifiable information about a specific 'Glen' near Whitebridge and the photographer's identity prevents definitive confirmation.  Both checks agree that the caption is plausible, given the lack of contradicting information and the image's context. However, the absence of concrete evidence to confirm each specific detail of the caption prevents giving a higher confidence score. The lower confidence score reflects this uncertainty. There are no significant conflicts between the internal and external checks; both assess the caption's plausibility while acknowledging the limitations of verifying its details without additional information.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible but not fully verifiable.  The image supports the presence of a stag in a Highland-like setting, but precise location and photographer verification require additional evidence. The overall plausibility is high, but uncertainty prevents a higher confidence level."

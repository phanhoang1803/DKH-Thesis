        "content": "Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 15th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.\nUnder the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 15th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that President Obama overruled Donald Trump's 2016 election victory and ordered a revote. Both the internal and external checks decisively refute this claim. The internal check highlights the image's content—a picture of Donald Trump with a quote expressing self-doubt—which is completely unrelated to the caption's narrative of Obama overturning the election results.  The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects the clear mismatch between the image and the caption.  The external check further strengthens this assessment by citing a news source that explicitly labels the claim as \"fake news.\"  The external check achieves a maximum confidence score of 10 because it provides concrete evidence from a reliable source debunking the claim.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The external check's supporting point clearly explains that while there were discussions about recounts and potential special elections in specific districts, no nationwide revote was ordered, and certainly not by President Obama to overturn Trump's victory.  Therefore, the caption is demonstrably false and completely unrelated to the provided image.  The high confidence scores from both checks (0 and 10) strongly support this conclusion.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty.  No entity analysis is needed as both methods clearly show the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly agree that the caption is completely out of context. The internal check finds no alignment between the image and caption, while the external check cites a news source explicitly debunking the claim as 'fake news'."

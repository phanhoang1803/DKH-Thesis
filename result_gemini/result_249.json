        "content": "Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that in late October 2019, several local news outlets reported on a rare purple lobster caught in Maine.  Snopes investigated this claim and found that the photos circulating online were digitally manipulated.  While several news outlets initially reported on the lobster, the report was based on a hoax. The hoax was admitted by Keith Potter on October 28th, who confessed to photoshopping the image.  Therefore, while news outlets did report on it, the underlying claim of a real purple lobster is false.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows a purple lobster, aligning with the caption's mention of a rare purple lobster. The explanation notes that while the image supports the existence of a purple lobster, it doesn't confirm the Maine location. However, the external check significantly lowers the confidence (8), revealing that the news reports about the purple lobster in Maine were based on a hoax.  Keith Potter admitted to digitally manipulating the image. This directly contradicts the caption's claim about the authenticity and origin of the purple lobster.  The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the external validation due to its reliance on factual evidence (Potter's confession and Snopes investigation). The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong evidence from the external check, despite the internal check's apparent alignment with the initially presented information. While the image shows a purple lobster, its origin and veracity are refuted by the external evidence, which proves that the news reports, and by extension the caption, were based on a fabricated image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the image's alignment with the caption, but external verification reveals the image and the underlying news reports were based on a hoax, leading to an overall conclusion that the caption is out of context."

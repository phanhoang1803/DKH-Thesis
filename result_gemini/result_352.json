While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem's health quickly registered here at Snopes.\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem's lyrics. We're not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere's how this joke appeared on the \"Dad Jokes\" section of Reddit:\n\"In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies the presence of Eminem in the image, giving a confidence score of 10. However, it acknowledges that the claim regarding his coronavirus diagnosis cannot be verified from the image alone. The external check, using Snopes as a reliable source, definitively debunks the caption's claim, providing strong evidence that it is false. This external verification carries a high confidence score of 10.  The discrepancy lies in the scope of verification. The internal check focuses solely on image content, while the external check leverages additional information to assess the claim's veracity. There is no conflict between the checks; rather, they complement each other. The internal check confirms the presence of Eminem, setting the stage for the external check to assess the truthfulness of the claim. The external check, with its high confidence score and factual backing from Snopes, overrides the limited scope of the internal check.  Therefore, the caption is out of context because it makes a factually incorrect statement about Eminem's coronavirus diagnosis. The combination of a strong internal check (confirming entity presence) and a definitive external check (disproving the claim) leads to a high overall confidence score in the final assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms Eminem's presence but cannot verify the coronavirus claim. External check (Snopes) decisively refutes the claim. Both checks align to indicate the caption is out of context."

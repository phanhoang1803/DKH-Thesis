Cameron has a mutated form of leprosy that is so rare, less than one in 600 million people will ever encounter someone who has it.\nThe strain, leprosis metapupalis carnivore, essentially turns its victim into a walking pile of dead skin, rotting flesh, and festering organs while keeping the brain functioning at primal levels and the heart pumping just enough to send diseased blood to the marrow and muscles to allow the person to be mobile.\nThis is not a genuine news item. TheLastLineOfDefense.com is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories, and carries multiple disclaimers labeling its content as fiction:\nIn a cynical world where the news of the day often seems fake, The Last Line of Defense offers today's busy conservative a place to go to read things they'll enjoy and congregate with a bunch of people they agree with. So while everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway.\nDISCLAIMER: Americas Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth.

    "explanation": "The internal check's low confidence score (0) reflects the inability to verify the caption's claim using only the provided image.  The image shows a man speaking, but offers no information about his identity or medical condition. This lack of information prevents any internal assessment of the caption's accuracy.\n\nConversely, the external check demonstrates high confidence (10) in its assessment. It definitively identifies the claim as false, citing its origin from a satirical website, TheLastLineOfDefense.com. The external check provides substantial evidence by referencing the website's disclaimers and nature as a purveyor of fictional content. This conclusively refutes the caption's assertion.\n\nThe significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks stems from the limitations of visual data versus the power of external fact-checking. The image provides insufficient information to confirm or refute the statement, leaving the internal check inconclusive. The external check, however, leverages readily available information to verify the source's reliability and the falsity of the information, thus decisively proving the caption to be out of context.\n\nThere is no conflict between the internal and external checks; rather, the external check provides crucial information that the internal check, due to data constraints, cannot.  The external source directly addresses the claim's veracity, providing irrefutable evidence of its falsity and origin from a known source of satire.  The external validation significantly outweighs the inconclusive internal validation, rendering a strong and confident conclusion that the caption is indeed out of context.\n\nIn summary, the caption \"Actor Kirk Cameron has contracted an extremely rare form of leprosy\" is demonstrably false according to credible external sources.  The image itself offers no information to support or contradict this claim. Therefore, the combination of a definitive external validation and an inconclusive internal validation leads to a highly confident conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation is inconclusive due to insufficient image data. External validation definitively proves the caption false, citing its origin from a satirical website. The high-confidence external validation outweighs the inconclusive internal result."

It was fairly easy to prove the image was edited, as it first appeared in mid-2015 (without Trump details):\nEven if the photograph's editing weren't so sloppy, the existence of the older original photograph gave the hoax away  it's incredibly unlikely paparazzi could have snapped identical (down to the facial expressions) images of Russell and Hawn in both mid-2015 and early 2016.",

      "explanation": "The claim that actors Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell were spotted wearing Donald Trump campaign shirts is explicitly labeled as \"False\" by Snopes.  Snopes provides evidence that the image circulating online is a digital fabrication, created by editing an older photograph.  The evidence shows the original photo predates the Trump campaign.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (score 10) in the accuracy of the caption, stating that the image clearly depicts Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell wearing shirts with Donald Trump's image and campaign slogans.  However, the external check, using Snopes as a source, provides strong evidence (score 10) that the image is a digitally fabricated image and the claim is false.  Snopes explicitly labels the claim as 'False' and provides evidence that the image was manipulated from an older photo predating the Trump campaign. This creates a significant conflict between the internal and external validation results.  The high confidence score of the external check (from a reputable fact-checking source), coupled with its evidence of image manipulation, outweighs the internal check's assessment, even though the internal check has a high confidence score. The internal assessment is based solely on the visual content of the manipulated image, without taking into account the image's authenticity or source. The external validation process provides crucial context about the image's origin and manipulation which changes the interpretation of the image's contents, ultimately revealing the caption to be out of context.  Therefore, the caption's assertion that Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell were seen wearing Donald Trump campaign shirts is deemed false based on the preponderance of credible evidence from the external fact-checking resource. The discrepancy stems from the fact that the internal check relies solely on a superficial analysis of the image itself, while the external check considers the image's origin and the process of image manipulation, making it more reliable. Because the image is fabricated, the assertion in the caption is untrue, resulting in an OOC (Out Of Context) rating of 'True'.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on image content alone; however, external validation from Snopes strongly refutes the claim, showing the image is digitally fabricated and the claim is false. The external validation outweighs the internal, as it uses reliable sources and exposes the image's manipulation."

It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check identified a discrepancy: while the image correctly shows Jodie Foster, the quote's context (wealth disparity) lacks specific geographic reference. The external validation check provided strong evidence from Snopes, definitively stating that the quote is falsely attributed to Jodie Foster. This external evidence contradicts the caption's claim.  Both internal and external checks, with high confidence scores (10 each), converge on the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The external check's strong evidence outweighs the partial accuracy of the internal check regarding the image. There is no ambiguity; the quote's misattribution is irrefutable based on Snopes' verification, making the caption inaccurate and out of context.  The internal check's observation about the lack of geographic specificity in the quote is secondary to the fundamental error of misattribution.  The misattribution, as confirmed by the external source, makes the entire caption unreliable. Hence, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is reached with high confidence.",

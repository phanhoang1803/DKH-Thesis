      "explanation": "The scenario described is plausible.  Eight-year-olds can participate in science experiments, and simulating life on Mars is a common educational activity. Germination experiments are simple enough for this age group. However, the specifics (Vivalys school, exact details of the experiment) are unverifiable without further information.  The claim is believable in principle but lacks sufficient evidence to be completely certain.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both raise concerns about the caption's accuracy. While the image depicts children in astronaut costumes, the claim that they are students from the 'Vivalys' school, conducting a specific three-day Mars simulation with a seed germination experiment, is not directly verifiable from the image itself.  The internal check highlights the lack of visual evidence for the school name and the three-day simulation duration. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the scenario in general but notes the unverifiability of the specific details. Both checks, therefore, agree that the caption is potentially inaccurate or at least lacks sufficient supporting evidence within the image to confirm it as entirely true. The confidence score is moderate (6) because the core element of children dressed as astronauts conducting a science experiment is visually confirmed, even though the specifics are unverifiable. This suggests the caption is likely partially accurate but incomplete or exaggerated.  Discrepancies arise primarily from the lack of confirmation for the school's name, the simulation's duration, and the detailed nature of the experiment. There is no direct conflict between the checks; they both agree that complete verification is impossible based on the provided image and that specific details are unconfirmed. The plausibility of an elementary school carrying out a space simulation enhances the overall credibility of the caption somewhat, but it does not validate the unverified specifics. Thus, the overall assessment leans toward the caption being out of context, not because the scenario is entirely implausible, but because the crucial details cited are unsupported.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks express uncertainty about the accuracy of the caption, primarily due to the lack of evidence confirming the school name, the specific experiment, and the duration of the simulation. While the general scenario is plausible, the specific details mentioned remain unverified."

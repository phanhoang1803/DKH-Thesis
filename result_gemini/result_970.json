        "content": "Claim:\nA video captures a cat with an extremely deep meow.\nIn May 2017, a 2015 video featuring a cat with an unusually deep voice inexplicably went viral, and was duly picked up by various tabloids:\nDont let this cats small stature fool you  he has a bass voice that would put Barry White to shame.\nIn a video filmed by the kittys owner, hes just chilling on the kitchen counter. Unsurprisingly, his ridiculously low voice has gone viral, with a lot of people wondering how its physically possible for such a tiny cat to produce such a noise.\nThere are several reasons to be skeptical about this footage. The video was originally posted to YouTube by \"Cash CatFlava\" in December 2015, bearing the description \"So this is Jack and he has some sort of type of laryngeal paralysis? At least thats what the vet told me.\"\nSome cats do suffer laryngeal paralysis, but a deep meow is not a known symptom of the disease. Dr. Jessica Vogelsang, a California-based veterinarian with expertise in small animals, told us: \"While certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism or masses can alter a cat's meow, I've yet to see a cat who developed a deep and humanlike meow like this. Any change in a cat's meow is a good reason to visit the vet because the meow shouldn't change over time!\"\nAccording to the American College of Veterinarian Surgeons, a cat with laryngeal paralysis may display harsh panting or a coarse (not deeper) voice:\nIn dogs and cats with laryngeal paralysis, the muscles that normally pull the airway open do not function properly. When an affected pet breathes in, the walls of the airway do not pull openrather, they are sucked into the opening, or in severe cases sucked shut. Early in the condition, this creates increased noise when they breathe; later, it can completely obstruct their airway, and they can suffocate. The early signs of laryngeal paralysis can be quite subtle.\nYou may notice:\nharshness in their panting\nincreased panting or panting when cool and calm\na hoarse or raspy-sounding bark\nA video of a cat suffering from laryngeal paralysis shows that their meows are not comically deep, but squeaky (and arguably a little sad):\nOur attempts to find similar videos of cats with unusually deep voices were unsuccessful. In fact, the only similar video we could uncover was uploaded by the same YouTube account, Cash Cat Flava, in October 2013:\nSetting aside for the moment what a coincidence it would be that the same person has come across two cats with laryngeal paralysis who sound identical, this video actually gives itself away as a fakery in the first few seconds. Before the cat exits the house, you can hear audio of its actual regular-pitched meow.",

      "explanation": "The news caption \"A cat with an unusually deep voice\" is supported by Source 1, which discusses a viral video of a cat with an unusually deep meow.  While the source ultimately concludes the video was likely overdubbed, the initial claim and widespread belief in the existence of such a cat are explicitly stated.  The source mentions the cat's voice as \"extremely deep\" and even mentions the cat's voice as \"a bass voice that would put Barry White to shame.\"",

  },
  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses low confidence (confidence_score = 3) and concludes the caption is false because the image only shows a cat; there is no information about its voice.  The external check, however, shows high confidence (confidence_score = 8) and concludes the caption is true, citing a source that describes a viral video of a cat with an unusually deep meow. Although the source suggests the video might be manipulated, it acknowledges the initial widespread belief and the description of the cat's voice as exceptionally deep, even comparing it to Barry White's voice.  The discrepancy arises because the image provides no audio information, while the external source relies on information from a video.  The image alone cannot verify the claim of an unusually deep voice.  Therefore, considering the high confidence of the external evidence that directly supports the caption and the limited information from the image, the final assessment leans towards the external validation's conclusion while acknowledging the image itself lacks direct evidence regarding the cat's vocal characteristics.  The confidence score is slightly lowered to reflect the inherent uncertainty stemming from the image's limitations.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check deems the caption false due to lack of vocal information in the image. External check finds the caption true based on a source describing a viral video of a cat with a deep meow, despite the possibility of manipulation.  The final decision is based on the stronger external evidence but with reduced confidence due to the image's lack of audio information."

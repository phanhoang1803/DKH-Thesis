While cultural practices surrounding death vary across the globe, there is no known instance of a person returning to life after three years. The claim requires substantial evidence to be considered credible, making it highly implausible based on current scientific and world knowledge. The story could be a misinterpretation, exaggeration, or folklore.  More context and verifiable sources are needed.",

    "explanation": "The caption claims a woman left her grave after being dead for three years.  Internal validation finds some alignment: the image depicts a mummified woman in what appears to be a Southeast Asian setting, consistent with Indonesia and the Toraja region known for unique funeral traditions. However, the confidence is low because the location is inferred, not explicitly stated. The external validation strongly refutes the claim.  The concept of a woman leaving her grave after three years of death is biologically implausible. Human decomposition is a well-established process; reanimation after three years lacks scientific support.  While cultural practices around death vary widely, no known traditions involve individuals returning to life after such a period. The high internal-external discrepancy stems from the caption's implausible core claim. The image shows a mummified body, potentially part of a cultural ritual, but this does not equate to the person leaving their grave after three years.  The external check, based on general knowledge about human biology and death, overwhelmingly discredits the caption's central assertion. Therefore, despite some contextual alignment, the caption is considered out of context due to its biologically implausible and unsubstantiated claim. The low confidence score reflects the significant discrepancy between the plausible visual context (mummified body, possibly in Toraja) and the biologically implausible claim of a three-year-dead woman leaving her grave.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows partial alignment with image context (Southeast Asian setting, potentially Toraja), but low confidence due to inferred location. External validation strongly refutes the caption's central claim (woman leaving grave after three years dead) as biologically implausible.  The significant discrepancy between internal and external results leads to a conclusion of 'out of context'."

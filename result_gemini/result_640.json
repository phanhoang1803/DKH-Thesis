        "content": "Claim:\nTed Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.\nOn 28 April 2017, a number of unreliable web sites began publishing stories reporting that rock musician and conservative icon Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident in Montana:\nTed Nugent, 70s rocker turned hunting guide and conservative icon, was shot and killed early this morning in a tragic hunting accident. While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

      "explanation": "The news caption stating that Ted Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident is directly contradicted by Source 1.  Source 1 explicitly labels the claim as a \"death hoax\" and provides evidence showing that Nugent was alive and well on the same day the rumors started circulating.  The source cites Nugent's Facebook Live video with his wife and statements from his spokeswoman confirming his survival. Therefore the claim is demonstrably false.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Explicitly states that the claim of Ted Nugent's death in a Montana hunting accident is a hoax.  Provides evidence of Nugent's Facebook Live video with his wife debunking the rumor, as well as a statement from his spokeswoman confirming he is alive.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption to be out of context because the image shows Ted Nugent alive and playing guitar, while the caption claims he was killed in a hunting accident.  This discrepancy is further validated by the external check, which provides strong evidence that the claim of Ted Nugent's death is a hoax.  Sources confirm Nugent's survival through statements from his spokeswoman and his appearance in a Facebook Live video. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the findings. Both internal and external checks confidently confirm that the caption is entirely false and out of context with respect to the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support that the caption is out of context. The image depicts a living Ted Nugent, contradicting the caption's claim of his death.  External sources confirm the death claim as a false 'death hoax'."

The statement that such a rally occurred outside the White House is plausible. However, without specific dates or further information to verify the event, I cannot confirm it with certainty.  The claim is plausible based on past events but lacks concrete evidence. ",

    "explanation": "Internal consistency check reveals strong alignment between the image and caption. The image depicts a protest outside the White House, featuring signs related to a government shutdown. The caption accurately describes a rally of federal employees, contractors, and supporters demanding an end to the shutdown. This strong internal consistency is supported by the external check which finds the described scenario highly plausible given the historical context of US government shutdowns and the common response of affected parties through protests and rallies. While external validation lacks specific confirmation of this particular event due to missing temporal information, the claim aligns well with common responses to such events, making it highly likely. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) strengthen the overall assessment of the caption's accuracy. There are no significant discrepancies, and the claim remains plausible and consistent with the visual evidence and historical precedent. The uncertainty mainly stems from the lack of precise event verification in the external check, but the plausibility remains extremely high. Considering both internal and external evidence, the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy is high, despite the lack of concrete external evidence confirming the precise date of the event.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, though external verification lacks specific date confirmation. The high plausibility of the event, based on historical precedents, and the strong internal consistency outweigh this minor uncertainty."

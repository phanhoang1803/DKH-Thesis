    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the alignment between the image content (Davor Dragicevic at a rally) and the caption's statement.  The image supports the caption's claim that Davor Dragicevic was present at a rally. However, the image doesn't provide information about the exact date or location, thus slightly reducing confidence. The external check considers the plausibility of the event sequence described in the caption. A person attending a rally and subsequently going into hiding, announcing it through a Facebook video, is a plausible scenario. However, there is no external evidence from news sources directly supporting this specific claim from the caption.  Both checks agree that the information in the caption is plausible, but lack conclusive evidence to fully verify the specific details (exact location and the precise timeline of the Facebook announcement).  The confidence score reflects this uncertainty. While the image supports the presence of Davor Dragicevic at a rally, the specific details regarding the date, location, and the timing of his subsequent actions are unconfirmed without further independent verification. Therefore, the OOC is set to false, as the core claim (Dragicevic's presence at a rally) aligns with image contents.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal and external checks both find the caption plausible, but lack definitive evidence to completely confirm all specific details. Image aligns with core claim of rally attendance, but additional information regarding timing and location remains unverified."

Therefore, the statement that she addressed the media outside 10 Downing Street on that date is plausible.  However, without access to a news archive or other records confirming this specific event, I cannot definitively verify it.",
      "supporting_points": "- Theresa May served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2016 to 2019.\n- 10 Downing Street is the official residence and office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n- January 16, 2019, falls within Theresa May's time as Prime Minister.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal consistency check gives a high confidence score of 10 because the image clearly depicts Theresa May speaking outside 10 Downing Street.  All elements mentioned in the caption (Theresa May, 10 Downing Street) are readily visible and accurately depicted in the provided image.  The external validation check provides a slightly lower confidence score of 8 because, while the date falls within Theresa May's time as Prime Minister and the location is accurate, there's no definitive external proof confirming a press address by her specifically on January 16th, 2019, outside 10 Downing Street.  News archives or official records would be needed to provide conclusive verification.  There's no significant conflict between the checks; both agree the caption is likely accurate, but the external check acknowledges the lack of definitive proof. Considering that the image perfectly aligns with what the caption describes, and the only limitation of the external check is a lack of concrete proof,  a final confidence score of 9 is given.  The plausibility of the caption based on the information available suggests it's highly probable to be true, although complete certainty isn't achievable without further evidence. The analysis weighs heavily on the strong internal consistency and the plausible nature of the external elements, leading to a strong but not absolute confirmation of the caption's accuracy.  The absence of directly contradictory evidence makes the assumption of truthfulness reasonable given the available data.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check is highly confident due to perfect image-caption alignment, while the external check shows some uncertainty due to a lack of definitive proof for the specific event date, though the date is within a plausible timeframe.  Overall, the caption is deemed highly likely to be accurate."

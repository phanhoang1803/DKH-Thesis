While the image doesn't explicitly show Maduro, it is clear that this is a rally in support of his government. There is some ambiguity as there are multiple people partially visible, so I cannot fully identify all faces in the image.",

        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people have marched through the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to protest against President Nicolas Maduro.\nOpposition supporters, staging their largest rally for two years, called for Mr Maduro's removal.\nThey blame him for Venezuela's economic crisis and accuse the electoral commission of delaying a referendum that could shorten his stay in power.\nMr Maduro's supporters also rallied in large numbers.\nHe accuses the opposition of trying to stage a coup.\nThe opposition said close to a million people turned out for their march, dubbed the \"Takeover of Caracas\", but the government disputed the figures.\n\"We have shown to the world the importance of Venezuela and how much it wants change,\" said opposition politician Jesus Torrealba.\nDressed predominantly in white, they chanted \"we are going to bring down Maduro\".\nProtesters said they had enough of the policies of the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela.\n\"We are going to defeat hunger, crime, inflation and corruption. They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,\" Naty Gutierrez told Reuters news agency.\nA small group of protesters clashed with riot police as the peaceful rally ended.\n\"The nation has triumphed. They wanted to intimidate the people but the people are here,\" said Mr Maduro at a rally in central Caracas he said was attended by 30,000 people.\n\"We have defeated an attempted coup that tried to fill Venezuela and Caracas with violence, death,\" he said.\nThe opposition hopes the march will pressure the electoral authorities into allowing them to launch the second petition needed to trigger the recall referendum as soon as possible.\nTiming is key as the date when the referendum is held will determine what happens next.\nIf a referendum should go against the president before 10 January, new elections will be held, which the opposition hopes to win.\nBut if it is held after that date and Mr Maduro is recalled, his loyal vice-president will serve out the end of his term until 2019.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly support the caption's assertion. The internal check finds strong visual evidence of a political rally in support of Maduro in Caracas. The flags and general atmosphere point towards this conclusion, despite the lack of explicit visibility of Maduro himself. The external check further reinforces this by citing a source that confirms large-scale rallies by Maduro's supporters. While the image doesn't show Maduro directly, the contextual clues and external source create a high degree of confidence that the caption accurately reflects the image's content.  The confidence score is high because both the internal and external validations independently support the caption's claim, indicating high likelihood of the caption's accuracy. There is no major discrepancy between the internal and external checks; both concur that the image depicts a political rally in support of Maduro in Caracas.  The internal assessment notes the lack of explicit visual confirmation of Maduro's presence, but contextual clues sufficiently support the interpretation. The external check directly supports the presence of large-scale rallies by Maduro's supporters, corroborating the visual cues in the image. The high confidence score of 9 reflects the converging evidence from visual analysis and external source verification. No conflicts arise between the two checks; instead, they synergistically enhance the confidence level about the caption's accuracy. There is no contradictory information to influence the final result. This strong corroboration between both the internal and external assessments confirms the caption is indeed in context with the image and the supporting information provided.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption. The image shows a rally with strong visual cues of support for Maduro, confirmed by external sources reporting large-scale rallies by his supporters in Caracas."

Mark Mezvinski is George Soros (sic) nephew!!\"\nThis post, which includes the words @illuminati killers, was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim isnt a new one, and it was amplified by the actress Roseanne Barr last year when she accused Clinton of being married to Soros nephew and tweeted: \"Chelsea Soros Clinton.\"\nClinton retweeted Barr  Barrs tweet has since been deleted  and said: \"Good morning Roseanne - my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soross nephews are lovely people. Im just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day!\"\nOpen Society Foundations is a philanthropic organization founded by Soros.\nClinton married her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, whose name was misspelled in the Facebook post, in July 2010. Reuters reported that the only high profile guests seen in the town where they married other than former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under Bill Clinton, actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, and fashion designer Vera Wang.\nMezvinsky is an investment banker and the son of Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, both former Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nSearching the Nexis database for anything involving the couple, George Soros, and the word \"nephew,\" we found 35 news stories. They were all about Roseanne Barrs allegation that Clinton is married to Soross nephew. And they didnt corroborate her claim.\nWe couldnt find any evidence to lend credence to this Facebook post. We rate it Pants on Fire!",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Chelsea Clinton is married to George Soros' nephew.  The internal check found no evidence in the provided image to support this claim; the image only shows George Soros.  The confidence score for the internal check is 0, indicating a complete lack of supporting evidence within the image itself.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence from a Politifact article that directly refutes the claim. The Politifact article details how this false claim circulated on social media and was even tweeted by Roseanne Barr.  Chelsea Clinton herself responded on Twitter, denying the claim. The article concludes there is no evidence supporting the claim, rating it \"Pants on Fire!\" with a confidence score of 10.  Given the decisive evidence from the external source, contradicting the internal check's lack of evidence, we conclude the caption is entirely out of context. There is no visual evidence of Chelsea Clinton in the image and the external check confirmed the factual inaccuracy of the statement.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external check heavily outweighs the 0 confidence score of the internal check. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context (OOC = True) with a high confidence score of 10, reflecting the strong external evidence against the caption's claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds no evidence in the image to support the caption. External check strongly refutes the caption's claim using a Politifact article and Chelsea Clinton's own denial, resulting in a high confidence score.  Both checks align in concluding the caption is out of context."

However, that lawsuit was about a records request and compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) related to Clinton's use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state -- it had nothing to do with the 2012 attack in Benghazi, was not a \"trial,\" and did not involve any appearance by Clinton herself in court.\nA House Select Committee extensively investigated the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead in Libya and issued a lengthy report that found no wrongdoing on the part of Clinton in connection with that event:\nEnding one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead.\nThe 800-page report delivered a broad rebuke of the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department  and the officials who led them  for failing to grasp the acute security risks in Benghazi, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect.\nPrevious investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation. But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes directly addresses the claim made in the news caption.  It states that while there was a court hearing in June 2020 involving Hillary Clinton and a public records request, it was not related to Benghazi and was not a trial. The Snopes article also mentions that the news of this hearing may have been overshadowed by other events, particularly the George Floyd protests. Therefore, the caption is partially true: there was a hearing involving Clinton, but it wasn't a 'trial' for Benghazi.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies Hillary Clinton in the image and notes the contextual relevance of Benghazi to her career.  However, it lacks the crucial detail that the caption's claim of a trial for Benghazi is inaccurate. The external check, using Snopes as a source, strongly refutes the core assertion of the caption. Snopes clarifies that while there was a hearing related to a public records request involving Clinton in June 2020, it was not a trial and was not related to Benghazi. This external validation is crucial because it addresses the accuracy of the caption's central claim, which the internal check doesn't directly assess.  Both checks agree that the news may have been overshadowed by other significant events. Therefore, the caption is partially true in this aspect but fundamentally false regarding the nature of the hearing (not a trial for Benghazi). The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) combined with the Snopes verification lead to a high overall confidence score of 9. The caption is deemed out of context because its central claim—a trial for Benghazi—is factually incorrect, despite some contextual elements being accurate. The discrepancy lies in the core claim's validity. The image shows Hillary Clinton, aligning with the caption's subject, but the caption's description of the events is misleading.  The external validation provides the decisive evidence needed to correct the inaccurate assertion about the trial and Benghazi.  The high combined confidence underscores the reliability of the conclusion that the caption is out of context because its central claim is false despite a correct identification of the subject (Hillary Clinton) and the incidental accuracy concerning the timing of the hearing and other competing news.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image subject and contextual relevance. External check (Snopes) decisively refutes the caption's central claim of a 'trial for Benghazi,' indicating it's out of context despite partially accurate secondary details. High confidence from both checks supports the final conclusion."

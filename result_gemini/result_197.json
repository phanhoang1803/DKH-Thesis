But claims on social media that she broke up his marriage misrepresent the facts. Brown had separated from his wife years before he and Harris had dated.\nFull Story\nFalse and misleading claims targeting Vice President Kamala Harris intensified as she drew closer to formally becoming the Democratic nominee for president on Aug. 5.\nWeve written about the false narrative that Harris only recently began identifying as Black.\nAnother viral claim circulating on social media rehashes old rumors about Harris relationship with the influential California Democrat Willie Brown in the 1990s while Harris was working as an assistant district attorney. These posts misleadingly claimed that Harris started her career by sleeping with a married man or that she stole a black womans husband.\nHere is what we know about Harris relationship with Brown.\nHarris was 29 in March 1994 when a San Francisco Chronicle columnist described her as Browns new steady, going on to say that she was something new in Willies love life. Shes a woman, not a girl. At the time, Brown, who was then 60 years old and speaker of the California State Assembly, had been estranged from his wife for more than a decade.\nAs speaker, Brown appointed Harris to the California Medical Assistance Commission later that year, which provides the basis for claims that Brown helped Harris career that sometimes accompany the claims suggesting that she broke up his marriage. (Brown left the Assembly in 1995, and became mayor of San Francisco until 2004.)\nBrown had married Blanche Vitero in 1957 and the couple had three children. But by the early 1970s, Brown was frequently seen around town with young women and his marriage collapsed, according to a 1996 biography written by James Richardson, a senior writer at the Sacramento Bee. It was at this time that Brown got the first of a series of apartments of his own, while his relationship with his wife settled into a mutually beneficial friendship, Richardson wrote.\nA 1984 profile published in the New York Times described Brown as an escort for attractive women and good friend of his former wife, from whom it says he separated amicably two years earlier.\nI dont know whether the marriage failed and the relationship survived or vice versa, but something very valuable lasted, Brown wrote in his own 2008 autobiography, explaining that he and his wife had celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2007, although they hadnt lived together in 25 years.\nAlthough Blanche and I led very different lives, there was never a breakup, he wrote. The two of us kept the family circle going. Weve always been in each others lives. Were friends.\nIndeed, as we said, Brown had developed a reputation for dating around and, in 2001, he welcomed a fourth child, a daughter, with his then-girlfriend Carolyn Carpeneti.\nHarris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship by the end of 1995 or the beginning of 1996. But it has come up repeatedly since Harris first sought public office as San Francisco district attorney, which she won in 2003. During that campaign, Harris was trying to distance herself from Brown, telling SF Weekly, His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing. She called him an albatross hanging around my neck.\nBut, 20 years later, claims about that relationship continue to shadow Harris as she seeks higher office.\nClarification, Aug. 8: We updated this story to better reflect the time frame for when Harris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "content": "Claim:\nVice presidential nominee Kamala Harris had an extramarital affair with former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who gave her two political appointments that launched her political career.\nRating:\nMixture\nAbout this rating\nWhat's True\nHarris did date former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown for a period of time between 1994 to 1995. In his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed her to two political posts  first to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and then to the Medical Assistance Commission.\nWhat's False\nAlthough Brown was technically still married during the time period that he dated Harris, he had been estranged from his wife Blanche Brown for more than a decade. Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened well after the relationship ended, and Harris sought to distance herself from Brown.\nOn Aug. 11, 2020, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, selected U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate. Harris, who is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, made history as the first woman of color nominated as vice president on a major party ticket.\nPredictably, the internet lit up with rumors about Harris, who has been married to her husband, attorney Douglas Emhoff, since 2014. Snopes readers asked about articles and memes circulating on social media stating that years prior, Harris had an \"extramarital\" affair with former San Francisco Mayor and California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, with some claiming that Harris' political success was achieved by being Brown's so-called mistress.\nA tawdry headline from Teaparty.org story read, \"Flashback: Kamala Harris Launched Her Political Career In Bedroom As Mistress Of Married Mayor Willie Brown.\"\nHere's an example of a meme circulating on Facebook, which appears to have been generated during Harris' run in the presidential primaries:\nThese narratives are misleading by way of exaggeration. Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, but Brown had been estranged from his wife since 1981. Brown did appoint Harris to two political posts in 1994 while he served as Speaker of the California Assembly, but that was years before Harris won her first election in 2003. She was already working as an assistant district attorney in Alameda County when she took on the appointments.\nIt's never been a secret Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s, although it may not be well known outside political circles in California. Brown addressed their past relationship in a terse piece published by the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 26, 2019, a day before Harris officially launched her presidential campaign:\nYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker.\nAnd I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.\nThe history of the relationship and political appointments Brown gave Harris have also been reported in California-based news outlets for years. Los Angeles Magazine reported in 2019:\nWillie Brown was a fixture in California politics for years, serving as speaker of the state assembly for 15 years, and known as something of an unofficial deal-maker and influencer. He first met Harris in 1994, when she was an assistant district attorney in Alameda County. He was 60 years old at the time, and had been estranged from his wife, Blanche Brown, since 1981.\nIn his capacity as speaker, Brown appointed Harris to two political positions. The first was a six-month appointment to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board; the second was a role on the Medical Assistance Commission, a body tasked with negotiating contracts to control Medi-Cal costs. At the time, Brown had a reputation for filling many openings with his personal associates and inner circle; when Harris vacated the Appeals Board gig, he replaced her with his longtime buddy Philip S. Ryan.\nHarris ended the relationshipwhich was conducted in the open and frequently reported on at the timein late 1995, shortly before Brown was sworn in for his first of two terms as mayor of San Francisco.\nHarris didn't run for political office until well after her relationship with Brown ended. In 2003, she made a successful bid for the office of San Francisco district attorney, a position she held until she was elected to serve as the attorney general of California, taking office in 2011. She held that post until she was elected in 2016 to serve in the United States Senate representing the state of California.\nHarris has been beset by allegations that Brown influenced her career for years. At the time of her first run for office for San Francisco district attorney, SF Weekly quoted Harris distancing herself from Brown:\nI refuse to design my campaign around criticizing Willie Brown for the sake of appearing to be independent when I have no doubt that I am independent of him  and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\nHis career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\nIn regards to the political appointments, Harris went on to state:\nThese jobs were created before I was born. Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work. I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital [in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood] open. I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs. I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no\nIt's true that Harris dated Brown between 1994 and 1995. During that time, when he was serving as speaker of the California assembly, Brown gave Harris two political appointments. Although it's true that Brown was married at that time, the relationship was no secret, since Brown had long been separated from his wife. All of Harris' electoral victories occurred years after her relationship with Brown ended. We rate this claim \"Mixture,\" because while there are elements of objective fact  Brown and Harris dated, Brown appointed Harris to two posts  other elements are sensationalized and misleading.",

As the state assembly speaker, Brown appointed her to two political posts: the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and later the Medical Assistance Commission.\nWhat's False\nWhile Brown was still married when he and Harris started to date, he and his wife, Blanche Brown, had been separated 13 years by then. Harris' first, successful run for office in 2003 happened eight years after the relationship ended. Since then, Harris and Brown have taken several opportunities to distance themselves from each other.\nAfter U.S. President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, ended his 2024 campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in July 2024, old rumors that she had \"slept her way to the top\" returned:\nThe claim spread quickly on X, Facebook and TikTok.\nSeveral people, including former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, insisted that Harris' affair to former San Francisco Mayor and Speaker of the California Assembly Willie Brown was relevant to her White House bid as proof of her \"ruthlessness\" and \"ambition.\" Indeed, they said, Brown gave her visibility by appointing her to two political posts in the mid-1990s, when they were reportedly \"dating.\"\nThe claim first appeared in 2020, after Biden nominated Harris as his running mate. At the time, a headline from Teaparty.org story read, \"Flashback: Kamala Harris Launched Her Political Career In Bedroom As Mistress Of Married Mayor Willie Brown.\"\nMemes generated during the 2020 Democratic primaries also shared the claim:\nThe rumors were misleading as they exaggerated both the adulterous aspect of the relationship and the importance of Brown's influence on Harris' career.\nThen 29, Harris dated Brown in 1994 and 1995, but Brown, who was 60 when their relationship began, had been separated from his wife, Blanche Brown, since 1981. Harris was assistant district attorney in Alameda County when they met. Brown then appointed Harris to two political posts while he was speaker of the California Assembly, but that was in 1994  years before Harris was elected district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. She would remain in that post until 2011, when she won the office of California district attorney. In 2016, she ran for U.S. Senate and was elected.\nNeither Brown nor Harris ever tried to conceal the fact they had been a couple . Brown addressed accusations of favoritism in the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 26, 2019 :\nYes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker.\nAnd I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.\nHarris announced she was running in the 2020 presidential election the next day.\nThe story was also well-known in California media. In 2019, Los Angeles Magazine published:\nWillie Brown was a fixture in California politics for years, serving as speaker of the state assembly for 15 years, and known as something of an unofficial deal-maker and influencer.

When she was a candidate to San Francisco district attorney, she told SF Weekly she had long stopped needing Brown's support:\nI refuse to design my campaign around criticizing Willie Brown for the sake of appearing to be independent when I have no doubt that I am independent of him  and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\nHis career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\nShe added, regarding the positions Brown had appointed her to:\nThese jobs were created before I was born. Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work.

The image only shows Kamala Harris, making it impossible to visually verify the affair or the appointments. The external check corroborates the relationship and appointments but points out the misleading nature of labeling it an \"extramarital affair.\" While sources confirm the relationship and Brown's role in her appointments, they also clarify that Brown was separated from his wife, making the \"extramarital\" label potentially inaccurate.  The discrepancies arise because the internal check focuses solely on visual verification, which is limited to the image's subject (Harris), while the external check considers additional context (Brown's marital status) beyond what's directly visible. Both checks indicate the caption is partially true but misleading or inaccurate in its presentation, and the lack of visual evidence in the image for the affair and political appointments makes the caption out of context.  The high confidence score (8) reflects that while aspects are verifiable (the relationship, the appointments), the caption's framing is misleading and not fully supported by evidence, ultimately rendering it out of context. The internal confidence score of 10 reflects that the picture shows Kamala Harris, but there is no supporting evidence for other claims in the caption, making it unsuitable for the picture.",

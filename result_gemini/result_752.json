        "content": "Claim:\nCalifornia's governor is under investigation for possible corruption.\nOn 17 April 2017, the web site consjournal.com published a story purporting to link California Governor Jerry Brown to a corruption investigation.\nHowever, the story didn't stand up to the barest of scrutiny. The headline said that Brown was \"caught in the middle of a $60 billion corruption investigation,\" a premise that is undermined by the sources it cites, each of which states that Brown ordered the probe into the state Board of Equalization  but he was not the subject of the investigation.\nOne of those sources, a March 2017 Sacramento Bee story, identifies the focus of the identification, which was spurred in part by an audit of the department:\nThe reports authors say they found well-paid tax auditors on parking lot duty at a promotional event, a steep rise in spending on activities that do not appear connected to taxes, and misleading information provided to lawmakers.\nThe audit takes particular aim at board member Jerome Horton, finding that he has reassigned public employees to work for him, arranged events that strayed from the agencys mission and opened a call center in his district without securing the consent of his fellow elected leaders. Horton has defended his outreach events as a way to reach large numbers of taxpayers.\nThe following month, Brown asked the state Justice Department to investigate the department, which collects an estimated $60 billion a year from more than 30 types of taxes, including fuel for motor vehicles and jets; alcoholic beverage taxes; and taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products, among others. It functions independently of the state Franchise Tax Board, which collects personal income taxes, and the Employment Development Department, which focuses on payroll taxes.\nA separate audit conducted in November 2015 found that board staffers incorrectly sent nearly $47.8 million in taxes to the state general fund. California State Controller Betty Yee undertook the review after noticing \"irregularities\" in the fund.\nBesides ordering an investigation into the board, Brown said in a letter to its members that he had barred it from hiring \"key personnel\", and restricted its ability to issue contracts without outside approval.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes states that Governor Jerry Brown was not the subject of the investigation, but rather ordered the investigation into the state Board of Equalization. While the headline might create a misleading impression, the article's content clarifies that Brown was not personally under investigation. Therefore, the news caption is partially accurate but needs qualification.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1 explicitly states that the investigation was ordered by Governor Brown but that he himself was not the target of the investigation.  The article refutes the claim that he was 'caught in the middle' by showing that he initiated the investigation. ",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check has high confidence (10) that the image depicts Jerry Brown, and the caption correctly identifies him. However, the external check (confidence 8) reveals a significant discrepancy. While the caption claims Brown was \"Caught in the Middle\" of a corruption investigation, the external source (Snopes) clarifies that Brown initiated the investigation into the state Board of Equalization and was not himself under investigation.  This directly contradicts the caption's implication. The external source provides strong evidence that the caption is misleading, portraying Brown's role inaccurately. Although the image itself is correctly identified, the context provided by the caption is demonstrably false. The high confidence scores from both checks, despite their conflicting conclusions, reinforce the need to prioritize the externally validated information, which shows the caption to be out of context.  The weight of the external evidence showing the caption to be misleading is greater than that of the internal evidence showing only the proper identification of the image subject.  In short, while the image is of Jerry Brown, the caption misrepresents his involvement in the corruption investigation, making the caption out of context. There is no ambiguity; the external evidence conclusively refutes the central claim of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image subject but external check reveals caption misrepresents Brown's role in the investigation.  Caption is misleading and out of context."

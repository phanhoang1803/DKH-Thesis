        "content": "TOKYO (AP)  Japan marked the 13th anniversary of the massive earthquake and tsunami that triggered a nuclear meltdown and left large parts of Fukushima prefecture uninhabitable on Monday with a minute of silence and memorial events, where officials pledged continued support for rebuilding.\nThe 9.0 magnitude quake and tsunami that ravaged parts of Japans northeastern coast on March 11, 2011 killed about 20,000 people and drove thousands from their homes in the prefectures of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima.\nAt 2:46 p.m.  the time when the earthquake struck  people across Japan stopped to observe a minute of silence. In Tokyos central Ginza shopping district, people stopped to pray on the sidewalk as a bell rang out, marking the moment.\nIn the town of Minamisanriku in Miyagi prefecture, a team of 10 uniformed police officers sifted though gravel and sand on the beach in an annual search for the remains of people who are still missing. Survivors prayed by the bare girders that used to be the towns disaster prevention center, where dozens died. In the town of Natori, about 400 people prayed and released balloons carrying messages of grief.\nIn Ishinomaki City in Iwate prefecture, residents gathered in a hilltop park where many of them took shelter 13 years ago, mourning as they stood facing the sea. In Rikuzentakata, about 100 people prayed atop a massive concrete seawall.\nAnd at a ceremony in Fukushima prefecture, where some 20,000 people still cannot return to their homes because of radiation, Gov. Masao Uchibori vowed that rebuilding will continue as the decades-long work of cleaning up the nuclear site continues.\nWe will not give up, he said. I pledge in front of the quake and tsunami victims that we will accomplish recovery at any cost.\nA wall of water over 15 meters (50 feet) tall slammed into the coastal Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, destroying its power supply and cooling systems, triggering meltdowns in three of its six reactors, and spewing radiation across the surrounding areas.\nThe disaster initially forced more than 160,000 people to leave their homes. Work to remove highly radioactive melted fuel debris has still not begun at the plant, and the overall decommissioning project is expected to last decades.\nAt the ceremony in Fukushima, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida renewed a pledge that the government will help secure jobs, livelihoods and the safe decommissioning of the plant so the former residents can return home.\nWe will continue to do utmost for the full-fledged recovery and rebirth, as well as the recovery of the northeastern region, he said.\nMost deaths from the tsunami and earthquake took place in Miyagi and Iwate prefectures, north of Fukushima, but they have been able to recover faster because they were not exposed to nuclear waste. The reconstruction of roads, seawalls and other infrastructure has been largely completed in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures, but many former residents have not returned due to the loss of communities.\nThis years memorial events also remembered victims of the devastating quake that struck Japans north central region of Noto on Jan. 1, which triggered renewed calls for a review of evacuation plans nationwide, including around nuclear plants.\nKishida later told reporters the government would work to ensure the ruined Fukushima Daiichi plant is decommissioned safely and transparently, citing recent mishaps including a contaminated water leak within the plant complex.\nIn a step the government and TEPCO say is crucial for decommissioning, the plant started releasing treated radioactive wastewater into the sea last August. The controversial discharges have faced protests by local fishers and neighboring countries  especially China, which has banned Japanese seafood imports.\nNational memorial services have not been held in Tokyo since the 10th anniversary, and municipalities in the disaster-hit areas now host local services each year.",

        "content": "TOKYO (AP)  Japan on Monday marked 13 years since a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the countrys northern coasts. Nearly 20,000 people died, whole towns were wiped out and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was destroyed, creating deep fears of radiation that linger today. As the nation observes the anniversary, the AP explains what is happening now at the plant and in neighboring areas.\nWHAT HAPPENED 13 YEARS AGO?\nA magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck on March 11, 2011, causing a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into the nuclear plant, destroying its power supply and fuel cooling systems, and causing meltdowns at reactors No. 1, 2 and 3.\nHydrogen explosions caused massive radiation leaks and contamination in the area.\nThe operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, says that the tsunami couldnt have been anticipated. Government and independent investigations and some court decisions have said the accident was the result of human error, safety negligence, lax oversight by regulators and collusion.\nJapan has since introduced stricter safety standards and at one point shifted to a nuclear energy phaseout. Prime Minister Fumio Kishidas government reversed that policy and has accelerated restarts of workable reactors to maintain nuclear power as a main source of Japans power supply.\nA deadly Jan. 1 earthquake in Japans northcentral region destroyed many homes and roads but didnt damage an idled nuclear power plant. Even so, it caused worry that current evacuation plans that solely focus on radiation leaks could be unworkable.\nThe nation marked a moment of silence at 2:46 p.m. Monday, with Kishida attending a memorial in Fukushima.\nWHAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE IN THE AREA?\nAbout 20,000 of more than 160,000 evacuated residents across Fukushima still havent returned home.\nDecontamination work before the Tokyo Olympics meant to showcase Fukushimas recovery led to the elimination of some no-go zones, but they remain in seven of 12 towns that had been fully or partially off-limits.\nIn Futaba, the hardest-hit town and a co-host of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, a small area was opened in 2022. About 100 people, or 1.5% percent of the pre-disaster population, have returned to live. The other host town, Okuma, which along with Futaba sacrificed part of its land to build an interim storage site for nuclear waste gathered from the decontamination, has seen 6% of its former residents return.\nAnnual surveys show the majority of evacuees have no intention of returning home, citing lack of jobs, schools and lost communities, as well as radiation concerns.\nResidents who have raised radiation worries or linked it to their health problems have come under attack for hurting Fukushimas reputation.\nThe disaster-hit towns, including those in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures, have seen sharp population drops.\nFukushima Gov. Masao Uchibori said on NHK TV that a growing number of young people want to move to Fukushima to open businesses or help in the reconstruction, and he expressed hope that more residents will return.\nWHAT ABOUT TREATED RADIOACTIVE WATER DISCHARGES?\nLast August, Fukushima Daiichi began discharging treated water into the sea, and is currently releasing a fourth 7,800-ton batch of treated water. So far, daily seawater sampling results have met safety standards. The plan has faced protests from local fishers and neighboring countries, especially China, which has banned Japanese seafood imports.\nFukushima Daiichi has struggled to handle the contaminated water since the 2011 meltdowns. TEPCO says the start of the process is a milestone and removing the tanks is crucial to make space for facilities needed as decommissioning progresses.\nThe contaminated cooling water is pumped up, treated and stored in about 1,000 tanks. The government and TEPCO say the water is diluted with massive seawater before release, making it safer than international standards.\nWHAT ABOUT LOCAL FISHING?\nDespite earlier fears that the water discharge would further hurt Fukushimas hard-hit fishing industry, they have not damaged its reputation domestically. Chinas ban on Japanese seafood, which mostly hit scallop exporters in Hokkaido, apparently prompted Japanese consumers to eat more Fukushima seafood.\nSampling and monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency have also boosted confidence in local fish.\nFukushima fishing returned to normal operations in 2021, and the local catch is now about one-fifth of its pre-disaster level because of a decline in the fishing population and smaller catch sizes.\nThe government has earmarked 10 billion yen ($680 million) to support Fukushima fisheries.\nANY PROGRESS REMOVING MELTED FUEL?\nThe contents of the three reactors is still largely a mystery. Little is known, for instance, about the melted fuels condition or exactly where its located in the reactors. Not even a spoonful of the fuel has been removed.\nAbout 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel remain inside the three damaged reactors, and Japanese officials say removing it would take 30-40 years. Experts call that timeline overly optimistic. The amount of melted fuel is 10 times that removed from Three Mile Island following its 1979 partial core melt.\nRobotic probes have glimpsed inside the three reactors, but their investigation has been hampered by technical glitches, high radiation and other complications.\nIts crucial for officials to understand the data from melted debris so they can make a plan to remove it safely. TEPCO aims to get the first sample out later this year from the least-damaged No. 2 reactor.\nTEPCO has been trying to get the sample by using a robotic arm. Officials have struggled to get the robot past the wreckage, and hope that by October they can use a simpler device that looks like a fishing rod.\nThe fuel in the worst-damaged No. 1 reactor mostly fell from the core to the bottom of its primary containment vessel. Some of it penetrated and mixed with the concrete foundation, making removal extremely difficult.\nIn February, the plant made its first drone flight into the primary containment vessel to investigate the melted debris and examine how the fuel initially fell from the core. But a second day of exploration was canceled because a data transmission robot failed.\nIS A 2051 COMPLETION POSSIBLE?\nThe government has stuck to its initial target for a completed decommissioning by 2051, but it hasnt defined what that means.\nThe lack of data, technology and plans on what to do with the radioactive melted fuel and other nuclear waste makes it difficult to understand whats in store for the plant and surrounding areas when the cleanup ends, according to TEPCOs decommissioning company chief, Akira Ono.\nAn overly ambitious schedule could result in unnecessary radiation exposure for plant workers and excess environmental damage, experts say.",

    "explanation": "Internal validation and external validation both support the caption's general assertion that the image depicts a Japanese memorial event related to the earthquake and tsunami disaster.  The internal check highlights the visual elements (lit candles, solemn atmosphere, people gathered) as consistent with a memorial. The external check confirms Japan's remembrance of the disaster, supporting the context. However, there is a minor discrepancy: the caption states 'ten years on', while external sources indicate it was the 13th anniversary.  This minor inaccuracy does not invalidate the overall message. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 each) outweigh this small discrepancy. The image strongly suggests a memorial, and external sources corroborate the event's nature. The year mentioned is a minor detail that doesn't change the core meaning.  Therefore, the caption is considered largely accurate, and the minor numerical error does not significantly impact the overall validity.",

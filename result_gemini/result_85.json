Past presidential campaigns have faced allegations of sexism and harassment, making a meeting to address such concerns from former staff credible.  The statement is not inherently contradictory or illogical. However, without specific evidence of such a meeting being publicly announced, the confidence score remains moderate.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both identify discrepancies between the caption and the image.  The image depicts Senator Bernie Sanders walking away from a podium, while the caption describes his plans to attend a meeting concerning sexism and harassment allegations from former campaign staff. The image itself provides no evidence supporting this claim, making the internal check's assessment of the caption's accuracy low (confidence score of 10). The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the described meeting, given past allegations against political campaigns, but this does not align with the image's contents.  The external check's confidence score (8) reflects the plausibility of the event itself, not its depiction in the provided image.  Since the image does not offer visual support for the described meeting and the external validation highlights the lack of direct evidence, the caption is considered out of context. The final confidence score reflects the plausibility of the claim, although not reflected in the image itself. This means the caption's description of Sanders' plans is not invalidated externally, but its direct relation to the provided image remains questionable and makes it ultimately out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks reveal inconsistencies. The image shows Sanders walking, not attending a meeting. The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of the meeting, doesn't confirm it with direct evidence.  Therefore, the caption is out of context, despite the event's plausibility."

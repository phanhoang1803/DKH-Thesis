While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem's health quickly registered here at Snopes.\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem's lyrics. We're not entirely sure where this joke originated because the text was copy and pasted across different social media posts.\nHere's how this joke appeared on the \"Dad Jokes\" section of Reddit:\n\"In a statement released by doctors, it has been revealed that his palms were sweaty, knees weak and arms were heavy.. He presented with vomit on his sweater already.. Initial testing has revealed it was mums spaghetti\"\nIf this \"news\" story sounds a bit familiar, it's because the text borrows heavily from Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" The song, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, starts with the lyrics:\n\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\"\nHere's a video of the song from the movie \"8 Mile\":\nThis is hardly the first piece of misinformation to spread about the coronavirus. We've previously debunked claims about \"The Simpsons\" predicting the outbreak, a pamphlet warning about the disease spreading via sex with animals, and China seeking approval to kill 20,000 patients to stop the spread of the disease. All of these claims were false.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies Eminem in the image but acknowledges the caption's claim regarding his coronavirus diagnosis is unverifiable from the image alone.  The external check, using Snopes as a source, definitively refutes the claim in the caption.  Snopes explains that the claim originated as a humorous social media post, misusing Eminem's lyrics. Both internal and external checks have a confidence score of 10, indicating strong support for their respective conclusions. The conflict lies in the caption's factual accuracy regarding Eminem's coronavirus diagnosis.  The image provides no evidence to support the claim, while the external check presents strong evidence to the contrary.  Given the high confidence score of both checks and the definitive evidence from Snopes, there is no reasonable doubt to conclude that the caption is out of context. The high level of agreement and the absence of any contradictory evidence strengthen the conclusion that the statement made in the caption is factually incorrect and unrelated to the provided image. There is no ambiguity in the data, and the evidence strongly points to the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and unrelated to the image.",

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows police officers attempting to arrest an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\nAs protests erupted across the United States in May 2020 after the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers, the internet was flooded with videos and photographs showing the sometimes chaotic scene.\nWhile much of this media gave genuine glimpses of these protests, a number of miscaptioned pieces of footage also made their way into the mix. The following video, for instance, was viewed millions of times as it circulated along with the claim that it showed two officers in Minnesota attempting to arrest a black man only to find out that he was an FBI agent:\nThis video, however, does not show the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. On the contrary, this video reportedly shows a police \"encounter with [a] black male\" in Rochester, Minnesota, and is unrelated to the protests in 2020.\nThis video was originally posted to Instagram by @thisisnike1 on May 31:\nIts timing coincided with the Floyd protests, but the original post included a caption explaining that this incident had been filmed \"over a year\" ago and that it involved the Rochester Minnesota Police Department. The original caption made no mention of the person in this video being an FBI agent. A version posted to YouTube by this account identified the person simply as a \"black male\":\nSomethin been telling me to hold on to this video over a year now, ok. Some days we make it home or some days we make it 6 feet deep. Imagine getting killed at home, while jogging, playing, minding your own business or just damn breathing #BeingBlackInWhiteAmerica!! This incident happened a year ago. The Minnesota police department been corrupt. Cant even smoke a damn cigarette in peace.\nSoon after this video was posted, it was re-captioned and shared along with the claim that it showed the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. It's unclear where this rumor originated. The above-displayed video makes no mention of this person being an FBI agent and when his wallet is pulled out by the police officer it does not show an FBI badge.\nThis rumor may have started with @thisisnike1, the account that originally posted the video. A screenshot supposedly showing a deleted tweet shows a message from @thisisnike1 reading \"[he is an] FBI agent.\" This appears to have been a joke, however, as this account has retweeted a number of people explaining that this person was not actually an FBI agent:\nIn sum, this video was originally shared with a caption stating that this incident took place over a year earlier (i.e., in 2019, not 2020) and that it featured an encounter between police and an unidentified black male. There's nothing in the video or the original caption indicating that this person was an FBI agent.\nWe reached out to @thisisnike1 and will update this article if more information becomes available.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 3, notes that the image shows police officers interacting with a Black man, but there's no evidence suggesting he's an FBI agent or that the event is connected to the George Floyd protests.  The external check, with a significantly higher confidence score of 10, provides corroborating evidence from Snopes, which explicitly refutes the caption's claim. Snopes states the video doesn't depict an FBI agent's arrest; instead, it shows an unrelated incident in Rochester, Minnesota, from over a year before the George Floyd protests.  The claim originated as a rumor or miscaptioning.  There is a strong alignment between the internal and external assessments, both concluding that the caption is misleading and inaccurate. The high confidence score of 10 reflects this overwhelming agreement. The discrepancies between the confidence scores (3 vs 10) are primarily due to the difference in the depth and scope of evidence used. The internal check relies solely on visual analysis of the provided image. The external check leverages information from a reputable fact-checking source (Snopes), providing more substantial and reliable evidence. This external validation is crucial in establishing the inaccuracy of the caption and justifies the higher confidence score.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they consistently point to the same conclusion.  The absence of any evidence supporting the caption's claim, coupled with strong evidence to the contrary from a reliable source like Snopes, makes the conclusion undeniable. In summary, the caption is definitively out of context, with a very high degree of confidence (10 out of 10), based on both the visual analysis and the external verification from Snopes.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly confirm that the caption is out of context. The internal check identifies a lack of visual evidence supporting the caption's claims, while the external check cites Snopes' fact-check, definitively refuting the caption's narrative."

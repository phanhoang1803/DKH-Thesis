Source 1 mentions that the Met Office issued several yellow weather warnings for snow and ice across the UK, lasting until Wednesday morning. While the caption specifies Saturday, the source mentions warnings in place across multiple days including Tuesday and Wednesday, making it partially supportive. The source also describes significant snowfall leading to school closures and road impasses, supporting the claim of heavy snowfall. ",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, noting that the image depicts heavy snowfall and a person clearing snow from cars, aligning with the caption's mention of heavy snowfall in the UK.  The mention of the Met Office issuing yellow weather alerts is plausible given the context, although not explicitly shown in the image. The external check provides a confidence score of 8, supporting the caption's claim of heavy snowfall in the UK and the issuance of yellow weather alerts by the Met Office.  However, there's a minor discrepancy: the caption specifies Saturday, while the source mentions alerts lasting until Wednesday. This discrepancy is minor, as the source confirms yellow weather warnings covering a period that includes Saturday, and overall supports the narrative of heavy snowfall requiring snow clearance as shown in the image.  Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy. The minor discrepancy regarding the specific day of the weather alert does not significantly impact the overall accuracy of the caption in describing the event of heavy snowfall in the UK and the related weather warnings.  Given the high confidence scores from both checks and the minor nature of the discrepancy, the caption is deemed accurate and in context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with minor discrepancy on the specific date of the Met Office weather alert. High confidence in the overall accuracy."

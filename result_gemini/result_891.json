    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check identifies a significant discrepancy: the image shows Ted Nugent alive and playing guitar, while the caption claims he was killed in a hunting accident. This conflict is corroborated by the external check, which confirms that Ted Nugent is still alive and that the caption's claim of his death is false.  Both checks have high confidence scores (10 and 2 respectively). The external check's lower score reflects the reliance on readily available information confirming Nugent's continued life; nonetheless, the consensus is clear.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty. The information provided by the image directly contradicts the caption's assertion.  The caption is entirely fabricated and has no basis in reality.  Further analysis is not needed as the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The discrepancy is not a matter of interpretation or missing information, but a direct factual error. No additional investigation is required to confirm the caption's falsity. The entity analysis aligns with the image and the verifiable facts: Ted Nugent is the person shown; his reported death is untrue.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly confirm that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context. The image clearly shows a living Ted Nugent, directly contradicting the caption's false report of his death."

        "content": "Claim:\nSamuel Pepys wrote about taverns being full of gadabouts during a plague in 1665.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn July 2020, a quote ostensibly written in 1665 by Samuel Pepys, dubbed the world's greatest diarist by some, started to circulate on social media. The passage lamented how \"gadabouts\" (defined by Cambridge Dictionary as \"a person who goes out a lot and does not worry about other things they should be doing\") were still frequenting taverns despite the risk of contracting the plague:\nThere are two slightly differing versions of the passage, one describing the taverns as \"full of gadabouts\" (as in the above meme), and the other describing them as \"fair full of gadabouts,\" as in the example below:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nSamuel Pepys, Great Plague 1665 MP and Diarist\n1633-1703\nThis is not a genuine quote from Pepys. This is a modern piece of writing that originated with a social media account parodying Pepys.\nPepys was a naval administrator and member of English Parliament. He was most famous, however, for recording a daily diary for nearly 10 years starting in 1660. Pepys wrote about several significant historical events during this time period, such as the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Great Fire of London, and the Great Plague of London in 1665. The above-displayed passage, however, was not written by him.\nThis quote originated with the Twitter account @Pepys_Diaries, a sort of parody account that reimagines Pepys as if he were a modern-day writer. This account provides a pretty big clue that these are not real quotes, as it uses the handle \"FakeyPepys.\" Also, it is noted in the account's bio that quotes from the real Pepys can be found on the Twitter account @SamuelPepys.\nOn March 20, 2020, the parody account posted the now-viral quote:\nOddly enough, this is not the only entity posting fake diary entries from Pepys as if they were written during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. On March 9, for instance, The Fence magazine published the \"Coronavirus Diaries of Samuel Pepys.\"\nPepysdiary.com, a website dedicated to Pepys' actual writings, addressed this misquote in a March 2020 article. The website noted that another quote from the parody account had also gone viral:\nTheres been a parody Samuel Pepys twitter account running for a while at @Pepys_Diaries. Its a modern-day take on Pepys, imagining him writing in the modern world. Unfortunately one of the accounts recent tweets, drawing parallels between the Plague and 2020s coronavirus, has been quoted out of context and spread around as if its a real excerpt from the diary. The tweet:\n\"On hearing ill rumour that Londoners may soon be urged into their lodgings by Her Majestys men, I looked upon the street to see a gaggle of striplings making fair merry, and no doubt spreading the plague well about. Not a care had these rogues for the health of their elders!\"\n(Update: Theres at least one more quote thats being passed around as if its genuine, but is also from the fake diary account:\n\"The taverns are fair full of gadabouts making merry this eve. And though I may press my face against the window like an urchin at a confectioners, I am tempted not by the sweetmeats within. A dram in exchange for the pox is an ill bargain indeed.\"\nEnd update.)\nScreenshots of this, attributed to Samuel Pepys in 1664, get passed around Twitter and Facebook as if its a prescient example of Pepyss diarising. There are obvious things that point to why its not a real quote (as outlined in this Londonist article), and misuses of language that are apparent to those of us who read the real diary, but that doesnt stop those who arent too familiar with the period.",

    "explanation": "The internal check aligns the image with the caption's assertion regarding Samuel Pepys' identity, giving it a high confidence score of 10.  However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  The Snopes fact-check definitively states that the claim about Pepys' diary entry concerning taverns during the 1665 plague is false.  The quote originates from a parody Twitter account, not Pepys's writings. The external check also has a high confidence score of 10. This substantial disagreement highlights a major conflict between the internal and external evidence.\n\nThe internal check's high confidence is based solely on the visual identification of Samuel Pepys in the portrait.  It does not independently verify the claim about the tavern quote. Therefore, this assessment relies heavily on external validation to determine the accuracy of the caption in relation to the image context. Given that the external check, a reliable fact-checking source, directly contradicts the caption, the caption is deemed out of context. The high confidence scores from both checks reinforce this conclusion.  The discrepancy is not due to a misinterpretation of the image or the text, but rather points to the claim's falsity, independent of the image's validity.\n\nThere is no ambiguity or uncertainty; a credible external source has irrefutably demonstrated the falsity of the statement about Pepys' writings.  The internal check's focus on image identity doesn't counter this evidence about the caption's factual accuracy.  The conflict is resolved by prioritizing the external check's findings, as they directly address the factual assertion within the caption itself.  The analysis concludes that the image is correctly identified, but the claim made about the image subject is factually incorrect, leading to a final judgment that the caption is out of context, with high confidence.\n\nIn summary, the internal check verified the image's subject (Samuel Pepys), but the external check conclusively disproved the caption's assertion about the content of his diary. The weight of evidence strongly supports a conclusion that the caption is out of context regarding the historical fact it claims.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms image shows Samuel Pepys (high confidence). External check refutes the caption's claim about Pepys' diary entry (high confidence). Significant conflict resolved by prioritizing the factual accuracy determined by the external check. Caption deemed out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that President Trump respectfully touched the face of a U.S. veteran who lost both arms.  Snopes.com confirms that Trump did touch the face of a man with prosthetic arms, but this man, Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr., was not a veteran.  While the caption accurately reflects the action of touching the face, it is inaccurate in stating that the person was a veteran. Therefore, the caption is partially true but contains a significant factual inaccuracy.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the image alone. The image clearly shows President Trump touching the face of a person with prosthetic arms. The caption accurately reflects this visual information. However, the external check reveals a significant factual discrepancy. While confirming the image's depiction of Trump touching a man with prosthetic arms, the external check (confidence score of 7) reveals that the individual is not a veteran, contradicting the caption's assertion. This conflict between internal and external checks necessitates a reevaluation.  The internal check relies solely on the visual content, making it limited in scope.  The external check provides crucial contextual information which is missing in the image alone. The external check's lower confidence score (7) might be influenced by the fact that verification relies on a single source. While the source is credible, additional confirmation from other sources would strengthen its assertion.  Since the external validation points out a significant factual inaccuracy (the person being a veteran), even though the visual aspect of Trump's action is accurately described, the caption cannot be fully considered accurate. The core misrepresentation of the man's veteran status significantly alters the narrative and the intended meaning of the caption.  Therefore, considering both the internal and external checks, the caption is deemed to be out of context due to the critical error concerning the individual's veteran status. The higher weight is given to the external validation due to its factual verification, which is more important than the image's interpretation in determining the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption consistent with the image, while the external check revealed a significant factual inaccuracy; the man was not a veteran, as stated.  The external check's factual correction necessitates labeling the caption as out of context."

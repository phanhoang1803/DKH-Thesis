On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

The evidence clearly indicates the claim is false.",

    "explanation": "The caption claiming the image shows a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is definitively false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check finds no evidence within the image itself to support the caption's claims. The image depicts a young girl with a distended abdomen, but nothing indicates her age, the cause of the distension (which could be numerous medical conditions), or any details about her life or circumstances.  The internal check assigns a confidence score of 0 because the image provides no information to verify any aspect of the caption.  The external check strongly refutes the caption's claims with a confidence score of 10.  This check cites evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, which conclusively demonstrates that the image is miscaptioned and the girl pictured suffers from liver and spleen problems.  Snopes explicitly states that the image does not depict a pregnant child. This external evidence directly contradicts the caption's narrative and provides strong, verifiable proof that the caption is out of context.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both agree that the caption is inaccurate. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong, reliable evidence provided by the external fact-checking source.  In summary, all available evidence—the lack of supporting information in the image and the explicit debunking by Snopes.com—consistently indicates that the original caption is completely false and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation conclusively demonstrate that the original caption is false.  The image itself offers no support for the caption's claims, while an external fact-check definitively refutes the claims, identifying the girl in the image as suffering from liver and spleen problems, not pregnancy."

      "supporting_points": "- Presidential powers do not extend to mandating the celebration of specific events, particularly those of a sensitive and divisive nature like abortion.- There is no historical record or credible news source reporting such an event.- The claim lacks verifiable evidence and is inconsistent with widely held knowledge about US politics and presidential actions.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check assesses the alignment of entities (President Obama, Mother's Day, abortions) with the image content, finding a mismatch because the image depicts a fabricated news report falsely claiming Obama declared Mother's Day as \"National Abortion Freedom Day.\"  The low confidence score (3) reflects the fabricated nature of the news report in the image. The external check further reinforces this conclusion with a confidence score of 1, definitively stating that the claim is factually incorrect.  There is no evidence of any such presidential order, and the assertion contradicts established knowledge of US presidential powers and actions.  The supporting points highlight the lack of historical record, the implausibility of such an order given its controversial nature, and the absence of credible news reporting to support the claim. There is complete agreement between the internal and external validations in determining the caption's inaccuracy.  The high confidence score (10) reflects this unanimous judgment. The fact that the image is a manipulated, misleading news piece underscores the unreliability of the caption's claim and solidifies the conclusion that it is entirely out of context. The discrepancies were the confidence scores given but the conclusions were the same. The image is of a manipulated image and the claim is completely false.  The internal check identified the fabricated nature of the image's claim and recognized the mismatch between the actual content and the original caption's interpretation of it. The external check provided factual confirmation that no such presidential order exists.  No conflicts between the checks exist; they are in total agreement.  Both checks support the out-of-context conclusion with high confidence because the discrepancies that were present, did not contradict the overall results.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The claim made in the caption is factually incorrect and unsupported by evidence, as confirmed by external sources and highlighted by the misleading nature of the image itself.  The checks unanimously agree on the caption's inaccuracy."

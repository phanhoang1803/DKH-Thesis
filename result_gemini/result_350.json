However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

While the exact date and location are debated (August 2015 in Los Angeles vs. May 2016 in Sacramento), the existence of a massive rally is confirmed.

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses uncertainty about the caption's accuracy due to the inability to verify the event depicted in the image as a Bernie Sanders rally and the unspecified location.  The confidence score is low (1) because the image alone does not provide sufficient information to confirm the caption. However, the external check strongly supports the existence of a large Bernie Sanders rally in California, with estimates of attendance exceeding 27,000.  While the exact date and location (August 2015 in Los Angeles or May 2016 in Sacramento) are subject to debate, the fact of a massive rally is corroborated.  This discrepancy stems from the limited information provided by the image itself. The internal check focuses solely on visual identification, lacking the contextual information readily available through external verification. Therefore, the external check carries greater weight due to its access to supporting evidence (photographic documentation of the rally).  The confidence score of 8 reflects the strong external validation while acknowledging the inherent limitations of solely relying on image analysis for event identification.  The image shows a large crowd, consistent with the external evidence of a large rally.  However, without clear identifying markers within the image (e.g., Bernie Sanders' likeness, signage, banners, specific location markers), the internal assessment remains uncertain.  This highlights the importance of integrating multiple sources of information (visual evidence, external documentation) to achieve a more accurate and confident validation. Ultimately, while the image does depict a large gathering that aligns with external descriptions of the Sanders rallies in California, the lack of explicit identification within the image itself necessitates a 'True' determination for OOC, indicating a mismatch between caption and image contents verifiable through the provided image only.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows low confidence due to inability to verify the image as a Bernie Sanders rally. External check strongly supports the existence of a large Bernie Sanders rally in California, causing a conflict. The final assessment leans towards the external validation, but the lack of definitive visual confirmation within the image results in 'OOC: True'."

Cars are not designed for such maneuvers, and the precise coordination required to successfully jump a ramp, land on moving vehicles, and continue driving is extremely unlikely.  The physics involved, including forces and potential damage, make this scenario highly improbable. The caption reads like an exaggeration or fabrication.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that a video shows a car evading police by jumping a ramp, bouncing off a semi-truck and a bus, and then driving away.  Both the internal and external checks strongly refute this claim.  The internal check, with a confidence score of 8, points out that the video only shows the car jumping a short ramp; it does not depict the car landing on any vehicles or driving away afterward.  This directly contradicts the caption's description of the events.  The external check, with a confidence score of 2, further weakens the caption's validity. It highlights the extreme improbability of the described scenario from a physics and engineering standpoint.  The precise coordination required for a car to successfully execute such a maneuver, and the immense forces and damage involved, make the original caption's claim highly implausible, leaning towards fabrication.  The discrepancies between the video content and the caption's narrative, coupled with the physical impossibilities discussed in the external check, converge to confidently label the caption as out of context. The alignment between both checks' negative assessments and the low probability of the described event strengthen the conclusion that the caption is misleading.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The video does not support the described actions, and the scenario itself is physically improbable."

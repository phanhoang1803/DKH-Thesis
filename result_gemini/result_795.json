The parody account mimics the distinctive aesthetic and style of NowThis videos. On Twitter, NotThis News describes itself as \"The number one source for 100% totally factual pop culture news,\" but also includes the word \"parody\" in its description.\nThe footage of Drake Bell, star of the Nickelodeon show Drake and Josh, in the NotThis News video is actually taken from his visit to the home of YouTuber Brian Awadis (known as FaZe Rug) in January 2017. Awadis addressed the NotThis News hoax in February 2018, and Bell himself confirmed it was a joke in a phone conversation between the two friends:\nThe tweets in the video are also hoaxes. The first, sent by \"Deborah Brown,\" was actually posted on 16 February 2018, the same day the video was posted. In the video, the tweet is edited to appear as if it was posted in November 2017, garnering 187,000 retweets. In reality, it got two:\nAnd the response \"Let's make it happen brotha\" was never sent by the Make-a-Wish Foundation. NotThis News fabricated it for the purpose of their video.",

    "explanation": "The internal check found no evidence to support the caption because the image shows a person at an event, unrelated to the parody account and video mentioned in the caption. The external check, however, strongly supports the caption's accuracy based on an external source that confirms the existence of a parody account, \"NotThis News,\" which created a deceptive video. This creates a significant conflict. Because the image provides no relevant information, and the external source is the only evidence supporting the caption, the final assessment is based solely on the external validation. However, the extreme conflict between the two checks, where one has no confidence and the other has complete confidence, reduces the overall confidence in the result.  The internal check completely fails to find any alignment between the image and caption. The external check alone does not suffice to completely validate the caption in relation to the image; therefore, there is a mismatch and the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found no alignment between the image and caption (confidence 0), while external check strongly supports the caption's accuracy (confidence 10).  The significant discrepancy results in a final assessment that the caption is out of context. The lack of relevant information in the image leads to a low confidence score."

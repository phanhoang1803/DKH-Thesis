        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

It explicitly states that the claim is false and provides evidence from Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, debunking the rumor.  Spera confirms the doll never left the museum.",

    "explanation": "The internal check assessed the caption's alignment with the image and the general knowledge surrounding the Annabelle doll. It found the caption internally consistent because the image depicts Annabelle and the caption mentions her connection to the Warrens' Occult Museum in Connecticut. However, the external check, utilizing a Snopes article, directly contradicts the caption's claim. The article provides a statement from Tony Spera, the Warrens' son-in-law, explicitly stating that Annabelle never left the museum. This strong external evidence decisively refutes the caption's assertion.  The high confidence score of 10 for both the internal and external checks highlights a significant conflict. The internal check relied on general knowledge and image recognition, which are susceptible to inaccuracies and misinformation.  The external check, using a reliable source (Snopes), provides concrete evidence that counters the claim.  Given the clear and direct contradiction from a trustworthy source, the external check's verdict must take precedence.  The conflict arises from a common misconception about the Annabelle doll. The image correctly shows Annabelle, fostering the impression of the caption's accuracy. However, this is misleading. The caption relies on a widely circulated yet false rumor.  Therefore, considering the weight of evidence, particularly from the reputable Snopes article, the caption is determined to be out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the certainty provided by the external verification.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check found the caption consistent with the image and general knowledge about Annabelle, while the external check, using a Snopes article, strongly refutes the claim, stating that the doll never left the museum. The external evidence outweighs the internal assessment due to its reliability and direct contradiction of the claim."

On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "explanation": "The original caption, claiming the image depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man, is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal analysis reveals a complete lack of evidence within the image itself to support the caption's assertions. The image shows a young girl with a visibly distended abdomen, but this could be due to various medical conditions, not necessarily pregnancy.  Crucially, there is no information regarding the girl's age, ethnicity, or the circumstances surrounding her condition. The caption's claim about pregnancy and the perpetrator's religious affiliation is entirely speculative and unsupported by visual evidence.\n\nThe external validation significantly strengthens the conclusion that the caption is out of context. A reputable fact-checking website like Snopes.com explicitly debunks the narrative presented in the original caption.  Their investigation reveals the image is misrepresented.  The girl depicted is actually a 12-year-old Brazilian girl suffering from a medical condition that causes an enlarged liver and spleen, resulting in the abdominal distension. The fact-check explicitly points out that the image was deliberately miscaptioned and circulated to spread Islamophobic misinformation. This external evidence corroborates the internal assessment that the caption is inaccurate and lacks evidentiary support.\n\nThe high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong agreement between the internal and external validation processes. Both methods independently concluded that the caption is out of context. The external validation adds considerable weight, as it utilizes verified information from a trusted fact-checking source, confirming the image's true context and debunking the false narrative propagated in the original caption.  The discrepancy between the caption's claim of a 9-year-old girl and the fact-check's statement about a 12-year-old girl is a minor detail that doesn't affect the core finding â€“ the caption falsely associates the image with pregnancy and a Muslim perpetrator. The essential point is that the image is unrelated to the events described in the original caption, and that the caption serves to spread a false and harmful narrative.\n\nIn summary, there is overwhelming evidence to confidently conclude that the original caption is entirely out of context.  The lack of internal evidence coupled with the robust external debunking from a reputable source leaves no reasonable doubt about the inaccuracy and misleading nature of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation independently and strongly confirm that the original caption is false and out of context. The image depicts a girl with a medical condition, not a pregnant child, and the details provided in the original caption are entirely fabricated and used to spread Islamophobic misinformation."

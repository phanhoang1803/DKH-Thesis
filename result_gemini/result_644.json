If a picture has been photoshopped, it's unlikely you'll find multiple pictures of the object from different angles. Surprisingly, we found an additional photograph of this SnAK-47, which indicates that this is a physical object, not a digitally created one:\nWhile these pictures appear to document a physical object, this \"snake\" is not real. For one, it seems unlikely that a snake's body would wrap so tightly around the angular shape of this gun. If a snake did eat an AK-47, its body would stretch from one protuberance to another, creating a more rounded shape.\nSo if this picture isn't photoshopped, and if this physical object isn't a real snake, what exactly does it show?\nIt shows art work created by Vasily Slonov, a Russian political artist, called \"Python-AK.\" According to Artsy.net, this art is made of rubber and was created in 2019.",

Snopes directly addresses this claim, stating that a picture circulating on social media supposedly shows this, but it is not genuine.  Snopes explains that the image is of a work of art, not an actual snake that swallowed a gun. Therefore, the caption is False.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) that the image depicts a snake-like object with an AK-47 integrated into it. The description \"A photograph shows a snake after it swallowed an AK-47\" aligns well with this visual interpretation at a superficial level. However, the external check (confidence 8), citing Snopes, strongly refutes the caption's claim. Snopes explicitly identifies the image as a work of art, \"Python-AK\" by Vasily Slonov, and not a real snake that ingested a gun. This external validation carries significant weight, as it's based on a reputable fact-checking source that investigated the image's origin and context.  The conflict between the internal and external checks necessitates a careful analysis. The internal check's high confidence stems from a straightforward visual interpretation of the image; however, it lacks the broader contextual information that the external check provides.  The external check's lower confidence score might be due to the fact that it relies on external sources, and the confidence reflects the uncertainty inherent in relying on external information.  The significant discrepancy highlights the importance of corroborating visual interpretations with reliable external sources. Given the substantial evidence from Snopes, which directly addresses the image's origin and nature, the caption is deemed out of context. The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong external evidence that negates the literal interpretation of the image, despite the internal check's high initial confidence in the visual alignment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in the visual interpretation of the image aligning with the caption. However, external check (Snopes) definitively identifies the image as artwork, not a real snake, resulting in a final verdict of 'out of context'."

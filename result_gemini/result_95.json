        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

      "explanation": "The provided text states that a video circulating online with the caption \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew\" is miscaptioned.  While the Kenyan government did use violent tactics to enforce curfew,  the video in question was created by a comedian and is not evidence of the government employing the Maasai tribe.  The evidence does support that the Kenyan government's approach to enforcing the curfew was not effective and led to violence by security forces, but not specifically with the Maasai tribe.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check and the external check both conclude that the original caption is out of context. The internal check flags a lack of evidence in the image to support the claim that Maasai people were used by the Kenyan government to enforce curfew.  The confidence score is 8 because, while the image shows a Maasai man, it doesn't offer proof of their role in enforcing curfews. The external check strengthens this conclusion with a confidence score of 6. It reveals that the video with the original caption is miscaptioned; it originated from a comedian, not from actual government actions. The external check provides further context: the Kenyan government did employ violent tactics to enforce curfews, but there's no reliable evidence implicating the Maasai tribe specifically.  Both checks align in their assessment that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. Considering the convergence of internal and external validations, a higher confidence score of 9 is assigned to the final conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The discrepancies are minimal. The internal check focuses on the image's lack of direct evidence, while the external check provides broader context from other sources.  However, neither check contradicts the other; they collectively support the conclusion that the claim in the caption is unsupported and likely false.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks show the caption is out of context. The image lacks evidence of Maasai involvement in curfew enforcement, and external sources reveal the video's comedic origin and the misrepresentation of government actions."

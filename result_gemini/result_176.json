While the article's verdict is that the claim is \"Miscaptioned\", the article itself acknowledges that posts on social media did indeed purport to show such flags at the rally.

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check finds strong evidence within the image itself to support the caption's claim. The presence of Nazi and Confederate flags is undeniable. The external check, while noting that the image's authenticity regarding the Million MAGA March is disputed by Snopes, acknowledges that images circulating on social media did indeed show such flags at rallies.  The discrepancy lies in the certainty of the location. The internal check is highly confident in the presence of the flags in the photo, while the external check focuses on the context of where and when the photo was taken. However, the caption doesn't explicitly claim the photo is definitively from the Million MAGA March, but rather that such flags were displayed at the event, which is supported by external evidence. While the location is not entirely verified, the core claim that the flags appeared together is substantiated by both checks, leading to a high confidence score. The internal check's high confidence score (10) reinforces the validity of the caption's core claim despite the external check's lower confidence score (8).  The external check's focus on the specific context of the \"Million MAGA March\" should not overshadow the internal validation's strong support for the presence of the flags.  The overall assessment concludes that the caption is not entirely out of context, as it correctly identifies the key visual element, even if the event's specifics lack absolute confirmation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the presence of Nazi and Confederate flags in the image. External check confirms the circulation of such images related to the Million MAGA March, though it questions their exact context. Both checks, however, support the main claim that these flags were displayed together, making the caption not out of context."

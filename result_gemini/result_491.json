This disinformation displays TCD's phone number and an incorrect TCD email/web address. THESE IMAGES ARE FAKED TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS. But some people believe them. TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didnt come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely.

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch between the caption and the image content. The image depicts a graffiti artwork, not a recruitment flyer. The external check, while supporting the claim about the existence of false recruitment flyers, does not validate the image's claim.  The external source mentions false images circulating, but it doesn't confirm that the provided image is one of them.  The conflict arises because the caption asserts that the image is a recruitment flyer, while the image itself shows an artistic piece unrelated to recruitment.  The external evidence validates the existence of such flyers but not the image's authenticity as one of them.  The high confidence score of 9 reflects the strong internal validation that the image does not match the caption's description and the moderately strong external evidence supporting the existence of the described recruitment flyers, although it doesn't confirm this specific image as one of them. The internal check provides a conclusive assessment of the image's content. The discrepancy arises from the caption misrepresenting the image's nature. The entity alignment is poor because the image content (a graffiti artwork) doesn't align with the caption's claim (a recruitment flyer).  There is no textual or visual evidence in the image to support the caption's assertion. The high confidence score reflects the high certainty of the internal check and the moderate certainty of the external check, weighing towards the internal assessment, given the clear mismatch between image content and caption description.  In summary, despite confirming the existence of fake recruitment flyers, the external validation fails to verify the image's claim, while the internal validation strongly refutes it.  Therefore, we conclude that the caption is out of context.",

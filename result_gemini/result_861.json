        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in Kenya who refused to obey the government's self-quarantine orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, a video supposedly showing a member of the Maasai tribe whipping people in the streets who were not obeying the Kenyan government's shelter-in-place order was circulated on social media. One posting to the Public Freakout section of Reddit, which racked up 75,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours, was entitled: \"Since people were not taking the police seriously the Kenyan government started using the Maasai tribe for the curfew.\"\nThis video is miscaptioned. The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action, the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown  with some incidents caught on video  seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check identifies a mismatch between the caption's description of whipping and the image's content, which shows a Maasai man but no act of whipping or any activity related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The confidence score of 7 reflects this clear discrepancy. The external check provides corroborating evidence, stating that the video is miscaptioned and was created by a Kenyan comedian for entertainment purposes, not as a record of government-sanctioned violence. The confidence score of 3, while lower than the internal check, still supports the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate. The external check's explanation further clarifies that while the Kenyan government employed violent tactics to enforce quarantine orders, this specific video does not depict such actions.  The external check's supporting points directly refute the caption's claim, confirming its lack of alignment with the video's actual context.  Considering the strong agreement between internal and external validation, with both suggesting a significant misrepresentation in the caption, the overall confidence in the 'OOC' judgment is high (9/10). There is no conflict between the checks; they both independently confirm the misalignment between the caption and the image/video.  No further entity analysis is needed, as the evidence from both checks is conclusive. The caption inaccurately depicts the video's content and its purpose, making it definitively out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation processes independently confirm that the original caption is out of context. The image shows no evidence of whipping or COVID-19-related actions, while external sources confirm the video's comedic origin and unrelatedness to the described events."

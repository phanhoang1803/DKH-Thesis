      "explanation": "The statement is plausible given that road blockages by protesters are a recurring event in many parts of the world, including Lagos.  However, without specific details of the protest or corroboration from news reports, it's difficult to definitively confirm the event. The date is also not recent enough to be easily checked with current news.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The caption \"Protesters blocked a road leading to the airport in Lagos on Oct. 12.\" aligns well with the image content. The internal check validates the caption's accuracy by pointing out the presence of protesters blocking a road leading to an airport, evidenced by the signage in the image and the visible protest signs and slogans. The location, Lagos, is supported by the text on some protest signs within the image. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the event given the context of road blockages and protests in Lagos, but it also highlights a slight uncertainty due to the lack of specific details of this particular protest that can be easily verified from readily available news sources. However, the uncertainty doesn't completely negate the alignment of the caption with the image content. The combination of high internal confidence (10) and moderate external confidence (6) leads to a final confidence score of 8. The fact that the date in the caption \"Oct 12\" is not specifically mentioned in the image does not affect the assessment, as it does not contradict the image content and the image doesn't provide a date. The general agreement between internal and external checks, with the limitations of external verification due to time and the lack of specific details about the protest, allows for a conclusive decision that the caption is not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy based on the image content, while external validation shows moderate confidence due to the limitations in confirming specific details of the protest. The overall assessment is that the caption is not out of context."

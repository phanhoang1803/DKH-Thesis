      "explanation": "The image shows a large amount of garbage left behind, which could plausibly be interpreted as having been left by refugees.  The caption mentions the direction of travel and origin country, which cannot be confirmed from the image alone.  Therefore, there's a reasonable level of certainty but not absolute confirmation.",

      "confidence_score": 6,
      "explanation": "While it is plausible that refugees traveling from Honduras to the United States might leave behind garbage, the statement lacks specific details to verify the claim.  The image itself is not provided for assessment, making it difficult to definitively confirm or deny.  Past instances of refugee caravans have shown instances of littering, making this scenario possible, but not necessarily certain without further evidence.",
      "supporting_points": "Past news reports about refugee caravans have occasionally included mention of waste left behind. However, this is not universally true of all such caravans.  The lack of visual evidence or specific details of this particular event makes it difficult to confirm or deny.",
      "verdict": true
    }
  },
  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is plausible but lacks definitive proof. The image itself is crucial for verification, and its absence weakens the certainty of the claim. The internal check highlights that the image shows garbage, consistent with the caption's description. However, it cannot confirm the origin or the route of the people who left it behind.  The external check further emphasizes this by pointing out that while past refugee caravans have occasionally produced similar scenes of discarded waste, this is not a universal characteristic, and there is no way to link this specific image to any particular event or group.  Both checks acknowledge the possibility that the caption accurately describes the situation depicted in the missing image, but the absence of that image lowers the confidence score.  While the claim is not demonstrably false, the lack of concrete evidence prevents a definitive confirmation.  Both the internal and external checks agree that the caption is not demonstrably false but falls short of providing conclusive evidence to support it. The absence of visual evidence leaves a gap that neither check can fill, therefore the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy is lowered to 7.  There are no major discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both reach similar conclusions based on the limited information available. The primary limitation stems from the lack of the image itself, preventing a robust assessment of the caption's accuracy.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible but lack sufficient evidence for definite confirmation. The absence of the image significantly limits verification capabilities, resulting in a moderate confidence score."

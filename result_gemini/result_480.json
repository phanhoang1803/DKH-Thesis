        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Joe Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's atrocities against its Uyghur population as the result of \"different norms.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2021, some news outlets accused U.S. President Joe Biden of making \"horrific excuses\" for China's atrocities against its Uyghur population.\nFor example, a New York Post headline dated Feb. 17, 2021, reported, \"Biden dismisses Uighur genocide as part of Chinas 'different norms.'\" The Post reported:\n\"President Biden is dismissing the genocide against the Uighur population in China, dubbing the mass internment a 'different norm'  despite the State Department this month responding to atrocities in the camps, following reports of systemic rape and torture.\"\nThe Post's editors followed this story up with an editorial claiming Biden had made \"horrific excuses\" for the Chinese government's human rights abuses.\nThis characterization of Biden's comments during the CNN town hall was misleading.\nThe remark in question came during a Feb. 16, 2021, presidential town hall held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. During the town hall, Cooper asked Biden whether he had brought up the Chinese government's human rights abuses, namely against its Uyghur population, in his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nBiden didn't say that cultural differences are a justification for China's atrocities against Uyghurs  instead, his meaning appeared to be the opposite of that. Biden stated that Xi implicitly understood he or any U.S. president would be expected to take a position against human rights abuses by the Chinese government. Here is a transcript of full the exchange between Cooper and Biden, with the key portion bolded:\nMR. COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We must speak up for human rights. Its who we are. We cant  my comment to him was  and I know him well, and he knows me well. Were  a two-hour conversation.\nMR. COOPER: You talked about this to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I talked about this, too. And thats not so much refugee, but I talked about  I said  look, you know, Chinese leaders  if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been  the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they havent been unified at home. So the central  to vastly overstate it  the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.\nI point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea Im not going to speak out against what hes doing in Hong Kong, what hes doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful  I said  and by the  he said he  he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they  their leaders  are expected to follow.\nLater Biden indicated that Xi knew that human rights abuses by the Chinese government would result in consequences:\nMR. COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just  is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What Im doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other  other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.\nWe reached out to the White House asking for clarification on Biden's remark.\nKedenard Raymond, director of communications for the National Security Council, wrote in an emailed statement to Snopes that Biden's comment conveyed the expectation that an American president will speak out against human rights abuses:\nPresident Biden has called the oppression of the Uyghurs a genocide, and he stands against it in the strongest possible terms. In that statement, the President was speaking about the need for U.S. Presidents to speak out on universal values, which are deeply held by Americans, and about human dignity everywhere. If you look at the preceding statement, the President stated: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. As he has said publicly and in the initial rounds of calls he has made to leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China, U.S. Presidents are expected to reflect the American norms and values of advocating for human rights.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim that President Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's actions against Uyghurs as a result of \"different norms.\"  Snopes rates this claim as False.  The article presents a detailed transcript of Biden's remarks, demonstrating that his comments were misinterpreted.  While Biden acknowledged \"different norms,\" his statement emphasized that American Presidents are expected to uphold American values and advocate for human rights, including condemning China's actions.  The White House also clarified Biden's position, stating he considers the Uyghur oppression a genocide and strongly opposes it. Therefore, the news caption is inaccurate.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes fact-check directly refutes the claim, providing a detailed transcript of Biden's statement and a White House clarification.  Biden's full remarks show he didn't excuse the atrocities but stressed the expectation that American Presidents must advocate for human rights, contradicting the caption's assertion.",

    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the image's alignment with the caption. While the image correctly depicts Joe Biden, it lacks any visual reference to China, Uyghurs, or the alleged atrocities.  The internal check's confidence score of 8 reflects this partial match, acknowledging that the image alone doesn't fully support the caption's claims. However, the external check plays a more crucial role in determining the caption's accuracy.  The external check, using a Snopes fact-check as a reliable source, found the caption's assertion to be false. The Snopes fact-check provides a comprehensive analysis of Biden's statement, revealing that the caption misrepresents his remarks.  The fact-check shows that while Biden acknowledged differences in norms between the U.S. and China, he did not excuse or dismiss the atrocities against Uyghurs.  The article includes supporting evidence like a transcript of Biden's speech and a clarification from the White House.  Both the transcript and White House clarification directly contradict the caption's statement.  The external check's high confidence score of 8, combined with the detailed supporting evidence from Snopes, strongly suggests that the original caption is inaccurate and misrepresents Biden's words and stance on the Uyghur issue.  The discrepancies between the internal and external checks are significant. The internal check only verifies a visual match of Biden in the image but fails to assess the accuracy of the controversial claim. The external check, on the other hand, directly addresses the core claim, confirming its inaccuracy through a credible source.  This external validation has more weight due to its direct refutation of the claim's central assertion. Therefore, considering both the partial visual match (internal check) and the conclusive refutation of the claim (external check), the caption is deemed out of context. The high confidence scores from both checks reinforce this conclusion, especially the external check's detailed evidence. The final assessment prioritizes the external check's thorough analysis and verifiable evidence, resulting in a high confidence score of 9.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows partial image-caption alignment (Biden present, but not the context of the claim). External check, using a Snopes fact-check, strongly refutes the caption's assertion as false. The external check's detailed evidence outweighs the partial internal alignment, concluding that the caption is out of context."

        "content": "Claim:\nHillary Clinton said children should be raised and trained by the state, and parents should have only a secondary role.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2016, a meme featuring a picture of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, along with a statement supposedly uttered by her about the role government should play in raising children, began to make the social media rounds:\nThis image was originally shared by the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr Page, one of many web sites dedicated to false information and misinformation about presidential candidates across the political continuum. Although the Tumblr page stated that their material consisted of \"100% sourced and verified quotes,\" we investigated several of the entries shared by that page and found all of them to be false.\nThe Tumblr page made its agenda clear in its description, \"Get to know the psychopath known as Hillary Clinton a little better.\"\nWe attempted to unearth this quote in the pages of Clinton's 1996 book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, but (unsurprisingly) came up empty-handed.\nThe only credible publication to connect this quote to Hillary Clinton was the Tallahassee Democrat. That connection, however, was posted on 26 October 2015 (a day after the putative quote appeared on the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr page) and appeared in the web site's \"Zing\" section, which features opinions and \"snappy one-liners\" from anonymous users.\nWhile it's true that Hillary Clinton published a book in 1996 called It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, it does not include the statement in question, and Clinton (a parent herself) has not said at any point that she believes children should be raised primarily by the state, with their parents taking a secondary role.",

    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 10,
      "explanation": "The news caption is False. Snopes.com, a fact-checking website, investigated the claim that Hillary Clinton said children should be raised by the state.  They found the quote to be false and originated from a website dedicated to spreading misinformation about political candidates.  The claim is not supported by any credible evidence and is explicitly debunked by Snopes.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes.com fact-check explicitly states the quote is false and originated from a misinformation website.  The claim that Hillary Clinton said children should be raised by the state is false.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check focuses solely on the alignment of entities within the caption and image.  It correctly identifies Hillary Clinton in both, resulting in a high confidence score of 10 and a True verdict. However, the external check, utilizing a reputable fact-checking website (Snopes.com), reveals that the claim is false. Snopes provides strong evidence that the quote attributed to Hillary Clinton is fabricated and originates from a misinformation source. This external validation carries a high confidence score of 10 and a False verdict.  The discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference in scope: the internal check assesses only entity presence and consistency, not factual accuracy; the external check verifies the claim's truthfulness against reliable sources. Because the external check examines the factual validity of the caption and finds it to be false, the caption is considered out of context.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 10) strengthen the final assessment.  The internal validation's focus on entities provides supporting context, showing that the image and caption do indeed refer to Hillary Clinton; however, the fact that the caption is demonstrably false trumps the internal validation. The external validation, grounded in verifiable fact-checking, holds greater weight in determining the caption's accuracy and contextual relevance.  There is no uncertainty, as both checks are decisively certain in their results, though their scope differs.  The conflict between internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the external check's assessment of the caption's factual accuracy.  Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms entity alignment (Hillary Clinton), scoring 10/10. External check (Snopes) reveals the caption's claim is false, scoring 10/10.  The external check's factual accuracy assessment overrides the internal check, resulting in an OOC verdict."

      "explanation": "The statement that both Mr. Trump and Brexiteers harnessed deep divisions within their societies is largely plausible.  Trump's presidency was characterized by significant polarization in the US, and the Brexit campaign exploited existing divisions within the UK.  However, the degree to which they \"harnessed\" these divisions is subjective and open to interpretation.  Some might argue they exacerbated existing tensions, while others might contend they tapped into pre-existing sentiments.  The claim requires further nuance to be definitively true or false.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal consistency check reveals a discrepancy. While the image shows Donald Trump, it lacks any visual representation of Brexiteers or the Brexit context.  The internal check highlights that only the presence of Mr. Trump is visually confirmed, giving it a confidence score of 8. This means only part of the caption aligns with the image's content.  The external check, although acknowledging the plausibility of the statement regarding societal divisions harnessed by Trump and Brexiteers, notes that the extent of such harnessing is subjective and requires further nuance.  The external check gives a confidence score of 8. Despite the high confidence scores from both checks, the conflict in terms of entity alignment from the internal check is critical.  The image is solely focused on Donald Trump; therefore, the mention of Brexiteers is completely out of context. This discrepancy lowers the overall confidence, even though the broader statement regarding exploitation of societal divisions holds external validity to some extent.  The claim about Brexiteers is not supported by the visual evidence. Considering the strong visual discrepancy, despite the external validity of the statement, the caption is deemed out of context (OOC). The overall confidence score remains high (8) due to the high plausibility of the statement about societal divisions, but the lack of visual alignment with the Brexiteer element makes the caption out of context relative to the image provided.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check identifies a significant visual discrepancy, as the image only depicts Mr. Trump, while the caption also mentions Brexiteers.  The external check confirms the plausibility of the caption's claim about the exploitation of societal divisions, but this does not resolve the visual mismatch. Hence, the caption is judged as out of context, despite relatively high confidence scores in both checks individually."

However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies that the image depicts a massive rally in Cuba, which is inconsistent with the caption describing it as a Bernie Sanders rally in California. The internal check's confidence is high (1) because the image clearly shows a large gathering with Cuban flags and signage, elements absent in typical US political rallies. The external check, however, claims that there were multiple Bernie Sanders rallies in California, supporting the caption's claim. This is where the discrepancy arises.  There's a critical conflict between the visual evidence and the external information. The external validation's confidence score (10) is high, but its supporting points lack the specificity and verifiable sourcing needed to outweigh the internal check's direct observation.  The external source merely mentions the *existence* of Sanders rallies in California, without providing any visual or contextual information to match the image.  There is no evidence linking the image to any specific event reported by the external source.  Therefore, despite the high confidence score from the external check, the visual evidence from the image itself, which is clear and unambiguous, is given more weight. The assertion that the image depicts a Bernie Sanders rally in California is highly implausible given the image's clear depiction of a Cuban rally.  The conflict is resolved by prioritizing the strong internal evidence and the lack of strong, verifiable evidence linking the image to a specific reported Bernie Sanders rally in California. The high confidence score of 10 reflects this decisive conclusion based on the discrepancies between the strong internal evidence and less specific external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly refutes the caption, identifying the image as a Cuban rally. External check claims that Bernie Sanders held rallies in California, but lacks visual or contextual details to support its claim. The internal visual evidence outweighs the non-specific external information, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

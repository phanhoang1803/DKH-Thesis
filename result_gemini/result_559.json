It was taken from a set of images published on 23 September 2009 in a Daily Mail article titled \"Six Flags over Georgia theme park submerged in Atlanta floods,\" in which the photograph caption and article text reported the picture as showing:\nThe upper part of the Six Flags Over Georgia's main rollercoaster is visible through the flood waters of the Chattahoochee River. The Scream Machine ride, once the tallest rollercoaster in the world, is all that remains visible of the popular tourist attraction after waters from the nearby Chattahoochee River in Atlanta flooded into the park.\nVersions of this photograph circulated in January 2016 (and again in May 2017) hinged on contemporaneous flooding events in several states; among those affected were Georgia, Missouri, and Illinois:\nA rare winter flood that brought record or near-milestone crests along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, claiming at least 25 lives in Missouri and Illinois, has largely subsided in the region. However, the Illinois River continues to rise in some Illinois stretches.\nThe National Weather Service says that's the amount that deluged much of Missouri and portions of Illinois over a three-day period starting Dec. 26. The pounding proved epic in some areas: The 11.43 inches that pummeled Springfield, Missouri, in December broke the city's 1895 record for precipitation for that month. Hydrologists with the weather service say such drenches occur in the U.S. only every 100 to 300 years.\nWhile the regions cited in various versions of the rumor were affected by flooding, Six Flags Over Georgia reported no adverse events on their Twitter feed (but invited followers to visit for holiday events):\nHad the park been underwater, potential visitors likely would have been informed via the same means, but instead Six Flags Over St. Louis repudiated the rumor via their Twitter feed:",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check, while acknowledging limitations in verifying the location and date independently, assesses the caption as accurate based on the visual alignment. It gives a confidence score of 10. However, the external validation check decisively contradicts this, providing strong evidence that the caption is miscaptioned.  It identifies the image as depicting flooding at Six Flags Over Georgia in 2009, not St. Louis in May 2017, as stated in the original caption.  The external check provides evidence from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, showing that the image's context was incorrectly assigned in several social media posts. The Snopes article explicitly rates the claim as \"Miscaptioned\". This external validation has a confidence score of 10. Given this significant discrepancy, and the higher weight given to the confirmed external source (Snopes), the final conclusion is that the caption is out of context (OOC=True). The confidence score remains high (10) because both internal and external checks display high confidence in their respective assessments, reflecting a strong consensus despite differing outcomes; the high confidence stems from the definitive evidence offered by the external validation which negates the visual assessment alone.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation aligns visually with the caption but lacks independent verification of date and location. External validation strongly contradicts this, identifying the image as from Six Flags Over Georgia in 2009, not St. Louis in 2017, based on evidence from Snopes. The external evidence is definitive, resulting in an OOC conclusion."

      "explanation": "Stags are known to be hosts for ticks, and various birds are known to feed on ticks found on mammals.  The location (Bristol, UK) is plausible, as both deer and various bird species are present in the UK. The scenario described is biologically plausible. However, without a verifiable source such as a photograph or news article, the event can't be definitively confirmed. Therefore, the plausibility is high but not certain.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses uncertainty about the location (Bristol, UK) and whether the bird is actually feeding on ticks.  The external check acknowledges the biological plausibility of the scenario but points out the lack of definitive proof. While the external check gives a higher confidence score (8) than the internal check (8), both agree that there's not enough evidence to verify all aspects of the caption. The uncertainty stems from the lack of verifiable sources supporting the specific claim of a bird feeding on ticks from a stag's fur in Bristol, UK. Although stags hosting ticks and birds feeding on ticks from mammals are common occurrences and the location is geographically plausible, this particular event isn't definitively confirmed. The image shows a stag and birds, but the exact interaction remains ambiguous without further supporting evidence.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because it presents a specific, unverifiable claim lacking solid evidence. The confidence score reflects the partially plausible scenario but acknowledges the significant uncertainty due to the lack of confirming evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption's claim lacks sufficient evidence, despite the biological plausibility of the described interaction.  The location is plausible but not definitively verifiable. The image does not provide sufficient proof to confirm the specific claim in the caption."

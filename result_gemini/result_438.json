      "explanation": "Forest fires can occur near beaches, especially in areas with dry vegetation.  Smoke is a natural byproduct of a fire. The scenario is plausible, though the proximity to a tourist beach might influence the severity of the event and response.  Without specific location and time, it's hard to verify.",
      "supporting_points": "Forest fires are a common occurrence, particularly in dry climates and during hot, windy seasons. Beaches are often located in coastal areas with varying types of vegetation, some of which can be flammable. Smoke is a visible sign of combustion.",

    "explanation": "The caption \"Smoke rises from a forest fire near a tourist beach\" aligns well with the image content.  Internal validation finds high confidence (score 10) because the image clearly shows smoke from a fire in the background and a beach with tourists in the foreground, confirming the caption's description.  External validation also supports the caption with a score of 8.  While there is no specific location or time, the scenario presented—a forest fire near a beach—is plausible based on real-world occurrences, where forest fires can indeed occur near coastal areas. The external check notes that the proximity to a tourist beach might affect the response, but doesn't contradict the core assertion of the caption.  There's no significant conflict between internal and external checks; both support the caption's accuracy. The slightly lower confidence score from the external check is due to the lack of specific details about location and timing, which limits the ability to confirm the event's exact details but does not invalidate the general scene depicted.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows the described scene, and the scenario is plausible based on real-world occurrences. The external check's slightly lower confidence stems from a lack of specific location and time details, though this doesn't invalidate the core description."

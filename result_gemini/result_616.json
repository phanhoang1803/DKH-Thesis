  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context.  The internal check finds a direct contradiction between the image (showing a living Celine Dion) and the caption (stating her death). This yields a confidence score of 10 and a verdict of False.  The external check corroborates this by confirming Celine Dion is alive and that no credible news sources reported her death in a plane crash in November 2019. This also results in a confidence score of 10 and a verdict of False.  There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks, both pointing to the caption's inaccuracy with high confidence. The caption's claim of Celine Dion's death is demonstrably false, based on readily available information. There is no conflict or uncertainty; the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image clearly depicts Celine Dion, and verifiable information confirms she is still living.  The combination of visual and factual evidence provides an extremely high degree of confidence (10/10) in the assessment that the caption is completely out of context.  No further investigation or alternative interpretations are necessary. The high confidence scores from both checks are consistent and directly support the conclusion. The caption uses the entity \"Celine Dion\" correctly in the sense that it is referring to the singer, but it misrepresents her current status. The fact that the singer is still alive is not disputed by any reliable sources, and directly refutes the caption's claim. Therefore, based on the total evidence, the final verdict is that the caption is definitively out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks decisively confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows a living Celine Dion, directly contradicting the caption's claim of her death. External verification confirms the singer's continued life and the absence of any credible news reports supporting the caption's narrative.  There is perfect agreement between the two checks, leading to a high confidence score."

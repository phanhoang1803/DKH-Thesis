    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a discrepancy: the image depicts snow walls lining a highway, which aligns with the caption; however, the location stated in the caption, Massachusetts, is incorrect. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of snow walls on highways in Massachusetts during winter, but it also highlights the inability to confirm the location definitively without access to the image.  This external verification supports the internal finding that the location in the caption is wrong. The high confidence score (8) from the external check stems from the general acceptance of snow and snow banks on roads in Massachusetts during winter. However, it doesn't directly validate the location in this specific image.  The discrepancy lies solely in the location mentioned. While the visual description of snow walls along a highway is accurate, the specific location needs to be corrected.  The high confidence score in the external check is based on general knowledge about weather in Massachusetts and typical snow removal procedures, which is not directly related to the accuracy of the location in the caption. Because the location detail is incorrect and this is a key component of the caption, we conclude the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check identifies incorrect location. External check confirms plausibility of snow walls on Massachusetts highways but cannot verify the location in the image.  Final verdict: Caption is out of context due to incorrect location."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that the image depicts buses used to transport paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.  Both the internal and external checks decisively refute this claim. \n\nInternal Check:\nThe internal check finds no evidence within the image itself to support the caption's assertion. The photograph shows a protest against Trump, but there are no buses visible, and nothing suggests the protesters are paid.  The absence of any supporting visual evidence in the image significantly weakens the caption's credibility.\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check provides strong evidence contradicting the caption.  A reliable source (implied to be Snopes, based on the description) investigated the claim and found it to be false. The source directly states that the claim about buses and paid protesters is incorrect and offers evidence connecting the buses to the Tableau Conference, an unrelated event in Austin, Texas. The external check's high confidence score (8) further reinforces the falsity of the caption.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. Both independently conclude that the caption is inaccurate. The internal check points to the lack of visual evidence in the image, while the external check provides concrete evidence from an external source debunking the claim. This convergence of evidence leaves no room for doubt regarding the caption's inaccuracy.\n\nEntity Analysis:\nThe image depicts a protest against Trump, with protesters holding signs expressing their opposition.  This aligns with the general context of anti-Trump protests following the election. However, the crucial elements of the caption—buses and paid protesters—are entirely absent from the image and demonstrably false according to external verification.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the strong agreement between the internal and external validation checks and the lack of any supporting evidence for the caption's assertions, the caption is demonstrably out of context and inaccurate. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the overwhelming evidence against the caption's truthfulness. The caption is entirely fabricated and does not represent the image's content.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly refute the original caption. The image lacks evidence of buses and paid protesters, and external sources confirm the claim is false.  There is complete agreement between checks, leading to high confidence in the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

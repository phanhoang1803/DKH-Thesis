        "content": "On May 27, 1937, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge opened, connecting bustling San Francisco to sleepy Marin County to the north. The Oakland-Bay Bridge had opened six months earlier  but the Golden Gate was an engineering triumph. It straddles the Golden Gate Strait, the passage from the Pacific Ocean into the San Francisco Bay, where rough currents prevail and winds can reach 70 mph.\nThe bridge's opening day was strictly for pedestrians. The day was typical for May in San Francisco: foggy, windy and cold. That didn't stop 200,000 people from crossing the bridge. Many walked. Others ran, tap-danced, roller-skated, unicycled or strode on stilts.\nThe night before the bridge opened, 16-year-old Edgar Stone and two high school friends finished watching a movie in a San Francisco theater. They decided to head to the bridge and be the first in line to cross.\nThey hung out all night, unable to sleep. Come morning, they trotted across the almost 2-mile span. When they got to the other side, the three teens collapsed on a railing to rest.\n\"We thought if we got lucky, we might get our picture in the paper,\" says Stone, who's now 91. And they did get lucky: A photographer from the News-Call Bulletin snapped the three teens leaning into each other, eyes closed.\n\"We were truly tired, although we were putting on a bit of show,\" Stone says. Besides the exhaustion, Stone remembers being above the San Francisco Bay for the first time and how far down the water appeared. \"Kind of a little frightening to look over,\" he recalls.\nNancy Kent Danielson, 85, had the same feeling as she saw the vast ocean on one side of the railing and the bay on the other. She was only 11 when she crossed the bridge on opening day with her parents and twin sister, Martye.\n\"But I was looking at people's waists,\" she says. \"I did notice that the roadway rose under our feet, that we were going uphill, and that took us all the way to the middle of the bridge before it leveled off, and then we could go down a bit.\"\nWhen it opened, the Golden Gate was the longest suspension bridge in the world. And it helped the city grow  but not everyone liked the idea.\n\"My father had a friend who thought the worst crime in the world would be to put a bridge there and spoil the beauty of nature,\" Danielson says.\nThe Marin Garden Club, where Danielson's mother was a member, even wrote letters in protest of the bridge's unusual color. \"They didn't think it should be anything but silver,\" she says.\n\"We suspected the bridge was going up just so it could ruin Marin County,\" she says. Marin residents were bracing for saloons and quick-food stands. And that's just what happened, Danielson says. With a laugh, she adds, \"I love people, but there are too many of us!\"\nLola Silvestri, 90, remembers reading about the building of the bridge practically every day in the newspaper.\n\"They only hired single men because of the danger,\" says Silvestri, who was 16 on opening day. \"We started out on the bridge as strangers,\" she says. \"By the time we got to the other side, we knew everybody.\"\nAt the bridge's last tower, Silvestri met a bridge worker who showed the teenager and her friend where he cemented in a dime. \"I was thinking about that the other day,\" she says. \"It was the end of the Great Depression, and there was the song 'Brother Can You Spare a Dime'  and I was wondering, what could you buy for a dime today?\"\nGeorge Klein, 95, was 20 when the bridge opened. It was cold, and he was wearing shorts. A former high school track star, he hoped to be the first to cross from the north end of the bridge in Marin.\n\"I ran all the way to the other side, but I couldn't find any officials,\" says Klein. So, he just turned around and jogged back.\nWhat Klein or anyone could foresee was that the Golden Gate Bridge was destined to become a global tourist attraction. Back then, it was a symbol of progress even during hard times. And before the bridges, the only way to get around the bay was by ferry.\nBut the ferry had its advantages, Klein says.\n\"I could take a train, then a ferry, and then take another ferry and then a train and make it to downtown Oakland in an hour and five minutes,\" he says. \"And I defy you to do that today with the bridges  that's how things have changed.\"\nThe ferries still run today  they're popular with tourists and some commuters. Their decks provide an open view of the landscape and the Golden Gate Bridge, now 75 years old.\nBack on the bridge's opening day, its chief engineer, Joseph Strauss, read aloud a poem he wrote at nearby Crissy Field:",

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows pedestrians swarming the Golden Gate Bridge during its 1937 opening ceremony.\nWhen it opened in 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge that connects the city of San Francisco to Marin County, California, was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world. Although it no longer holds claim to either of those titles (Japan's Akashi Kaiky Bridge exceeds it in both respects), the Golden Gate Bridge remains one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, is one of the most-photographed structures on Earth, and stands as a globally recognized symbol of one American city.\nAs reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, the official opening of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937 was a huge event that spanned nine days of celebrations, with two separate opening days  one for pedestrians and one for cars  drawing hundreds of thousands of bridge-crossers:\nExcitement was so high for the bridge that the Golden Gate Fiesta included nine days of celebrations, and not one opening day but two. The first opening day, May 27, 1937, was limited to pedestrians.\nThe organizing committee estimated that 100,000 people would take advantage of the opportunity to stroll across the bridge without interference from cars, but they seriously underestimated the appeal. From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. that day, more than 200,000 flocked to the bridge for a chance to say they walked across.\nThe next day cars were allowed on the bridge. Precisely at 11 a.m. May 28, dozens of U.S. Navy planes would fly over the Golden Gate Bridge, followed by Navy ships of all sizes  three aircraft carriers, 13 heavy cruisers, six light cruisers and six destroyers  passing underneath the bridge.\nIn recent years, a photograph said to depict that (first) opening day in 1937 has frequently been shared online with the caption \"The Golden Gate Bridge opening to the public for the first time back in 1937, and yes, it almost collapsed\":\nBut this picture doesn't date from 1937, nor did we find any contemporaneous accounts stating that the Golden Gate Bridge \"almost collapsed\" at that time. Although this photograph is displayed in black-and-white and therefore looks fairly \"old\" to modern eyes, it was actually taken in 1987, when an estimated 300,000 people swarmed the bridge during its golden anniversary celebration.\nThe original image was captioned as follows: \"Shot from the South Tower facing south down onto the roadway overlooking a mass of people at the 50th anniversary celebration for the Golden Gate Bridge.\"\nThe crush of pedestrians who crossed the bridge that day in 1987 did cause it to sag about 7 feet at its mid-section, and some onlookers did fear at the time that the structure was in danger of buckling, but engineers maintained that the combined load was well within the bridge's capacity:\nOn May 24, 1987, 300,000 people were stuck in human gridlock for hours while getting a rare chance to cross the 1.7-mile bridge en masse on foot to celebrate the bridges golden anniversary. Officials quickly closed the bridge, so a half-million other people waiting to cross never got the chance. Still, the enormous, unprecedented weight caused the middle of the bridge to sag 7 feet.\nIm grateful because if the others had gotten out there, maybe the bridge would have fallen down, Gary Giacomini, then president of the bridge districts board, told The Associated Press at the time.\nBut engineers said afterward that the bridge was never in danger of collapsing.\nIndependent engineers agree[d] ... that structurally the bridge was safe during the Golden Gates last big celebration.\nIt was probably the biggest load the bridge had ever seen, said Mark Ketchum, a San Francisco bridge engineer who studied the Golden Gate Bridge from 1989 to 1991. But it did not exceed the design load capacity of the bridge.\nOn fully loaded suspension bridges the size of the Golden Gate, its normal to have deflections of up to 10 feet, said Greg Deierlein, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering.",

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) based on the visual alignment of the image with the caption's description of the Golden Gate Bridge opening. However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score of 3) that contradicts the claim of the bridge almost collapsing during the 1937 opening.  External sources indicate that the image actually depicts the bridge's 50th-anniversary celebration in 1987, and that while a slight sag occurred then, there was no danger of collapse. The conflict arises from the caption's claim that the bridge almost collapsed in 1937, a claim unsupported by external evidence. Because the external evidence is substantial and points toward the claim being false,  we must prioritize it over the internal assessment, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The external evidence directly refutes a key part of the caption, reducing our overall confidence slightly from a perfect 10 to 8, as there was initially strong visual confirmation of the bridge in 1937 from the internal check.  The core of the discrepancy lies in the temporal aspect and the claim of near-collapse. The external source's assertion that no contemporaneous accounts support such a near-collapse during the 1937 opening significantly undermines the caption's claim. Therefore, given the preponderance of evidence from external sources, we can confidently declare the caption to be out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check aligns visually with the caption, but the external check strongly refutes the claim of near-collapse during the 1937 opening.  External sources suggest the image is from 1987.  The external evidence overrides the internal assessment, leading to a conclusion of OOC."

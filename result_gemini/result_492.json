    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check found strong alignment between the caption and the image content. The image depicts Jared Polis at a podium, surrounded by people who appear to be family and supporters, consistent with an election night event. The internal check's high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong alignment.\n\nThe external check also supports the caption's claim, although with slightly lower confidence (8).  The check acknowledges the plausibility of the scenarioâ€”Jared Polis's public profile and the common occurrence of election night gatherings for political candidates.  The uncertainty stems from a lack of specific details like the exact date or election, making definitive external verification impossible. However, the supporting points (Polis's political career, typical election night events, general political knowledge) lend significant credence to the caption's accuracy.\n\nBoth internal and external checks agree that the caption is likely accurate.  The slightly lower confidence score from the external check is accounted for by the inherent limitations of verifying a specific event without exact contextual details. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks.  Both concur that the caption is largely consistent with the image, given the available information. The slight difference in confidence scores reflects the different levels of certainty achieved using internal (direct image analysis) versus external (general knowledge and contextual plausibility) methods.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the caption is not out of context (OOC: False).  The final confidence score of 9 reflects the high degree of agreement between internal and external checks, while accounting for the external check's acknowledgement of the limitations in achieving absolute certainty.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check has perfect alignment (confidence 10), and external check has high plausibility (confidence 8), although the lack of specific details prevents absolute certainty.  Both checks agree that the caption is not out of context."

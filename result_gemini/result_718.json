        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that \"Paid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\"  Both internal and external validation processes provide evidence to assess the accuracy of this caption.  Internal validation analyzes the image itself, while external validation uses outside sources to fact-check the claim.\n\nInternal validation reveals a moderate level of consistency (confidence score of 8). The image shows numerous buses parked near an apartment complex in a location that seems to be Austin, Texas. This aligns with the caption's assertion that protesters were bused in. However, the image provides no evidence concerning whether the protesters were paid or \"fake.\" The image's visual information only supports the \"bussed in\" aspect, leaving the \"paid\" and \"fake\" components unverified within the image's context.\n\nExternal validation, using Snopes, directly contradicts the caption (confidence score of 8). Snopes explicitly debunks the claim, asserting that the buses in similar images circulating online were associated with the Tableau Conference, not with anti-Trump protests. They traced the origin of the misinformation to a misinterpretation of the images on Twitter, which then spread through less credible websites. This contradicts the caption's assertion.\n\nThe conflict between internal and external validation needs careful consideration. While the image (internal) offers weak visual support for the \"bussed in\" part of the statement (and no information on the \"paid\" or \"fake\" components),  the external source (Snopes) categorically refutes the entire claim.  This discrepancy points towards the caption being highly likely out of context.\n\nThe high confidence scores (8 out of 10) for both internal and external checks, combined with the significant conflict in their findings, strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The Snopes fact-check provides compelling evidence that the claim is demonstrably false. The image itself, while showing buses, lacks evidence to support the \"paid\" and \"fake\" elements and only weakly suggests that people were transported by bus, which, as clarified by Snopes, was in connection with a technology conference.  The lack of evidence to support the \"paid\" and \"fake\" aspects, coupled with Snopes' direct refutation, makes the out-of-context determination highly reliable.  We acknowledge that the image shows buses, but the external source convincingly counters the caption's core assertions, leading to a final OOC judgment of True with a high confidence score of 9.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows weak visual alignment with the caption's description of buses, but cannot confirm the 'paid' and 'fake' aspects.  External validation via Snopes strongly refutes the caption, indicating the claim's falsity due to a misinterpretation of the images. The conflict between the weak internal support and the strong external refutation leads to a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

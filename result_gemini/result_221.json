    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy. The internal check highlights the clear presence of a giraffe in a zoo-like setting, giving a confidence score of 10.  The external check confirms the existence of Denver Zoo and the common occurrence of giraffes in zoos, further reinforcing the plausibility of the caption with a confidence score of 10. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) strongly indicate that the caption \"A giraffe at Denver Zoo\" is highly likely to be accurate. The image shows a giraffe in a setting consistent with a zoo environment, and the external knowledge confirms that Denver Zoo is a real zoo that houses giraffes.  There's no contradictory evidence to suggest the caption is inaccurate. The alignment of entities (giraffe, zoo) within the image and the caption is perfect. The internal validation focuses on the visual elements and contextual clues presented by the image, while the external validation leverages real-world knowledge about zoos and their inhabitants. The combination of both methods significantly increases the confidence in the caption's accuracy.  Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is not out of context and is highly accurate based on the available evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the caption's accuracy with high confidence scores (10/10). No discrepancies were found. The caption aligns perfectly with the image content and external knowledge."

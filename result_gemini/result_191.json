      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Thai artists are known for creating thought-provoking installations, and using porcelain is a common medium.  Wat Prayurawongsawas is a real temple in Bangkok. However, without further evidence (e.g., an image of the installation, news articles about it), it's impossible to verify the existence of this specific artwork by Nino Sarabutra. The title \"What Will We Leave Behind\" aligns with themes explored in art, making it a realistic title for such a piece. Therefore, while plausible, the claim requires external verification.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both agree that the caption is plausible, but neither provides definitive proof. The internal check gives a confidence score of 8 because the image clearly shows an art installation of small white skull-like objects in a setting that resembles a temple courtyard. A person walks through the background, which is consistent with the idea of an artist's work being displayed. The external check offers a score of 7.  It points out the plausibility of the caption, noting that Thai art frequently incorporates religious or philosophical themes, porcelain is commonly used in sculpture, and the temple in Bangkok does exist. However, it acknowledges a lack of concrete evidence to confirm the artwork's existence, specifically the artist, title, and the precise details of the installation.  There is no direct conflict between the two checks; they both highlight the plausibility of the caption but also recognize the absence of definitive proof.  The lower confidence score of 7 reflects this uncertainty. While the visual elements of the image strongly suggest a contemporary art installation in a temple setting, confirming the specific details of the artwork, as stated in the caption (artist, title, and the exact work), necessitates external verification beyond the scope of this image analysis.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible but lack definitive proof. The image aligns with the general description, but external verification of the artwork's specific details is needed."

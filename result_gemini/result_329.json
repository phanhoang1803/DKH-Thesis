  "final_result": {

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "Internal consistency check reveals high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy because all entities (Serhiy Kivalov, Liberty Ball, Trump's inauguration) are correctly identified and aligned with the image content. The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of the claim (score 8), points out a lack of definitive proof regarding Kivalov's presence at the specific event. This discrepancy necessitates a conservative approach. Although the image strongly suggests Kivalov's attendance at a Liberty Ball during Trump's inauguration, the absence of irrefutable external evidence lowers the overall confidence score.  The internal validation's high score is based solely on the image's visual information and its apparent contextual details.  However, this visual evidence is insufficient to definitively confirm the event's precise date and Kivalov's actual participation without further corroboration from external sources like news reports, official guest lists, or Kivalov's own statements. The external check highlights the need for additional evidence to conclusively verify the claim, despite the apparent internal consistency.   Therefore, while the internal evidence points towards the accuracy of the caption, the lack of definitive external verification makes the overall assessment less certain, resulting in a lower confidence score and a classification of 'out of context' (OOC = true). This conclusion acknowledges the limitations of the available information and prioritizes rigorous validation standards.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows high confidence in the caption's accuracy based on image content; however, external validation lacks definitive proof of the event and Kivalov's attendance. Discrepancy lowers the overall confidence score and classifies the caption as potentially out of context."

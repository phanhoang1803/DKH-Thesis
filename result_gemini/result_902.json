(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check has a confidence score of 0 and states that the image depicts a large iceberg, while Lake Michigan is a freshwater lake where such icebergs are not found.  This discrepancy is due to a fundamental mismatch between the image's content and the caption's description. The external check corroborates this with a confidence score of 10, citing documented evidence refuting the claim that the icebergs are from Lake Michigan. The external check provides verifiable information from sources that explicitly state the erroneous attribution of these icebergs to Lake Michigan in previous years, providing a factual basis to support the claim that this caption is indeed out of context. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both consistently point to the caption's inaccuracy. The high confidence score (10) from the external check, supported by the internal check's assessment (0), indicates a high degree of certainty that the caption is mismatched to the image context.  The external check provides irrefutable evidence about the correct geographical origin of the icebergs, further strengthening the assessment. There is complete alignment between the findings of both the internal and external checks, reinforcing the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The image depicts an iceberg, while the caption incorrectly claims it is from Lake Michigan.  External sources confirm that this misattribution has occurred in the past, and the actual location of the icebergs is far removed from Lake Michigan."

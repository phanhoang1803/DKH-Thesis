      "explanation": "The image shows Barack Obama signing a document.  The caption claims he is signing an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance. However, there is nothing in the image that supports this claim.  The image only shows the act of signing; the content of the document is not visible. Therefore, the caption's claim about the executive order's content is not verifiable from the image alone. The entities are present in the image (Obama), but the caption's claim regarding what is being signed is completely unsubstantiated and false.",

Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.\nDuring the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values.",

        "content": "Q: Did President Obama sign an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools?\nA: No. That claim comes from a satirical story on a fake news website.\nFULL QUESTION\nDid Obama sign Executive Order 13738, revoking the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance and banning it in public schools? Did he say the language of the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values?\nFULL ANSWER\nThe rumor that President Barack Obama banned the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools originated from a satirical article posted last month by a fake news website under the headline Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. The site is designed to look like ABC News, but uses the URL abcnews.com.co, the first tip-off that this isnt a legitimate news site.\nThe made-up story begins: Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. It goes on to say the order makes it illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty, which also applies to public schools. Those who violate the order, the bogus story says, can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.\nThe satire becomes abundantly clear for those who read on. The story includes quotes from Sock it Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks and Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.\nAnd then theres this description of abcnews.com.co at the bottom:\nabcnews.com.co: Thanks to ABC News President & CEO, Dr. Paul Horner for making ABC News the greatest website in the universe.

Paul Horner is an internet satirist who has created many fake news websites, articles and hoaxes. He takes responsibility for the pledge article on another one of his websites. The phone number listed for the complaint department, as well as at the bottom of the article as an Obama administration hotline, is the number of the Westboro Baptist Church, which is best known for its anti-gay views and protests.\nAn executive order with the number 13738 does exist, but it deals with labor laws and the federal governments use of private contractors. It has nothing to do with the Pledge of Allegiance. Obama signed it on Aug. 23, and the text is available from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. The National Archives also publishes an official list of all executive orders issued by Obama.\nThere have been legal challenges, dating back decades, to school boards and other organizations that require the pledge to be recited, concerning the under God phrase or religious beliefs. The Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette in 1943 that it is unconstitutional to force children to recite the pledge in public schools. The court ruled that it violates their rights under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. But this does not make it illegal to display or recite the pledge, or to encourage it.\nSources\nObama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide. abcnews.com.co. 31 Aug 2016.\nExecutive Order 13738 of August 23, 201.

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption, \"Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge of Allegiance in Schools Nationwide,\" is entirely false and out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 10, points out that while the image shows Obama signing a document, it provides no evidence about the document's content. The claim that it's an executive order banning the Pledge of Allegiance is completely unsubstantiated by the visual information.  The external check, also with a confidence score of 10, definitively refutes the caption's claim using fact-checking websites, Snopes and FactCheck.org. These sources identify the claim as a hoax, originating from a satirical fake news website and explicitly state that no such executive order exists.  There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks; they both concur that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10), combined with the consistent finding of falsity, strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There is no uncertainty in the assessment; the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates the caption's falsehood.  The entity alignment is partially correct (Obama is present in the image), but the crucial part of the caption – the claim about the executive order – is entirely fabricated and not supported by any evidence. Considering the overwhelming evidence from both internal and external analyses, the assessment is decisively conclusive.  Further analysis isn't needed. No ambiguity or conflicting information exists. There is no question that the original caption is out of context and demonstrably false.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks (confidence score of 10 each) confirm the caption is false.  The image shows Obama signing a document, but offers no verification of its content; external checks debunk the claim as a hoax from a satirical website.  There is complete agreement, resulting in high confidence that the caption is out of context."

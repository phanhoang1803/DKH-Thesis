According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\nRobs a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com  where the story originated  clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press theyve had no such complaints made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no visual evidence in the image to support the claim about a man losing his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the complete lack of visual support for the caption's narrative within the provided image. The image shows a damaged scuba tank and a scene that appears to involve an emergency response, but there is nothing to connect these elements to the specific events described in the caption.  The external check further reinforces this conclusion by citing two independent sources that explicitly debunk the story as a hoax.  These sources provide details of how the story originated and spread as a false news report, clarifying that there is no credible evidence to support the claim. The external sources' high confidence score of 10 aligns perfectly with the internal assessment.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both unequivocally refute the caption's accuracy.  The alignment between the high confidence scores from both internal (10) and external (10) checks strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context. The complete absence of supporting evidence within the image and the explicit debunking by reliable external sources leave no room for doubt. No entity analysis is necessary to resolve any conflict as both checks are in complete agreement.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks definitively confirm that the caption is out of context.  The image lacks visual evidence supporting the caption, and external sources confirm the story is a hoax."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows snow walls lining a highway in Massachusetts.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph showing high walls of snow lining the edges of a highway has been circulating on the Internet since at least 2007. Popular memes have claimed (for humorous effect) that the picture was taken in Massachusetts, or (less homorously) in Canada:\nThe image actually captures a stretch of road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture.\nThe photograph was taken by Mihai Apostu and posted to his blog, \"A Romanian in Japan,\" in April 2007:\nBefore heading down town we decided to take a walk up to Towada. On the way to Towada starting from April thh Gold Line Route is opened. This year's amount of snow was smaller than last year but the Hakkoda Walls are still big. Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall. This year there were only 6 metres of snow that guided us to Tsuta Onsen.\nAccording to a sightseeing guide for the Aomori region of Japan, the Hakkoda Walls are quite a tourist attraction. Heavy snowfalls frequently close the corridor during the winter, but when the spring season approaches the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad gets to work and clears the road:\nNational Highway 103, commonly known as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line, is a popular sightseeing route in Aomori.8 km of this Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line stretching from Sukayu to Yachi Hot Springs is closed off in winter, but thanks to the efforts of the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad, they plow through the snow from both ends to meet at Kasamatsu Pass in late March, creating a stunning snow corridor.\nIn some places the walls of snow reach a height of 9 m, allowing visitors to enjoy magnificent views of the vivid blue of the sky contrasted against the white of the snow in perfect harmony.\nThe road opens to general traffic on April 1, but before this, a Hakkoda walk is held every year to walk through this snow corridor, and many people take part in the event.",

      "explanation": "The news caption mentions towering snow walls in Massachusetts.  The evidence from Snopes directly addresses this, stating that a viral image showing such walls is miscaptioned. The image is actually from Japan, specifically near the city of Towada in Aomori prefecture. Therefore, the caption is inaccurate.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly suggest the original caption, \"Are These Towering Snow Walls in Massachusetts,\" is inaccurate. The internal check identifies a discrepancy between the image's content (towering snow walls) and the caption's claim of the location (Massachusetts).  It assigns a confidence score of 3, indicating moderate certainty in this discrepancy. The external check provides stronger evidence, referencing a Snopes article that directly debunks the claim.  Snopes definitively states that the viral image, depicting snow walls, is misattributed to Massachusetts. The actual location, according to Snopes, is Japan (near Towada in Aomori prefecture). This external validation gives a high confidence score of 8, demonstrating strong evidence against the caption's accuracy.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both point to the same conclusion: the caption is out of context.  The combined evidence from both checks, with the external check carrying more weight due to its higher confidence score and concrete source, leads to a high overall confidence score of 9 for the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The external validation significantly strengthens the internal assessment, eliminating any doubt about the caption's inaccuracy. The entity analysis supports the findings: the entities of \"towering snow walls\" are present in the image, but the entity of \"Massachusetts\" as the location is definitively proven false by the external source.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is inaccurate. The external check, supported by Snopes, provides strong evidence that the image is from Japan, not Massachusetts, resulting in a high confidence score."

        "content": "Claim:\nTed Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.\nOn 28 April 2017, a number of unreliable web sites began publishing stories reporting that rock musician and conservative icon Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident in Montana:\nTed Nugent, 70s rocker turned hunting guide and conservative icon, was shot and killed early this morning in a tragic hunting accident. While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes explicitly debunks the claim that Ted Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.  The article details the spread of this false report and provides evidence showing Nugent was alive and well on the day the rumor circulated, including references to a Facebook Live video with his wife.",

    "explanation": "The internal check and the external check both strongly agree that the caption is out of context. The internal check notes that the image depicts Ted Nugent alive and playing a guitar, directly contradicting the caption's assertion that he was killed.  The external check corroborates this by referencing a Snopes article which debunks the death rumor and provides evidence showing Nugent was alive at the time. Both checks have a confidence score of 10, indicating high certainty in their assessments. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both methods independently arrive at the same conclusion.  The high confidence scores from both checks, along with the consistent findings, solidify the conclusion that the caption is completely false and out of context with the image.  The image clearly presents a living Ted Nugent, while the caption falsely reports his death. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty; the evidence overwhelmingly refutes the caption's claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows a living Ted Nugent, while the caption falsely claims his death."

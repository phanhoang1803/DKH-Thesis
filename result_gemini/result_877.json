        "content": "Claim:\nThe Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as \"The Conjuring,\" had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\nThe terms \"Annabelle\" and \"Warren Museum\" both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum  it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren's Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \"The Amityville Horror\" and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere's an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\nBut the Warren's Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens' son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \"Annabelle escaped\" rumors.\nSpera said: \"Im here to tell you something, I dont know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelles alive  well, I shouldnt say alive  Annabelles here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim that the Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum.  It explicitly states that the claim is false and provides evidence from Tony Spera (the Warrens' son-in-law) refuting the escape.  The article also notes that the rumor appears to have originated from a mistranslation and lacked any supporting evidence such as police reports or eyewitness accounts.",

    "explanation": "The internal validation check assessed the caption's alignment with the image, focusing on the presence of Annabelle and its association with the Warren's Occult Museum. It correctly identified Annabelle in the image and acknowledged the connection to the museum. However, the internal check's assessment of the caption's accuracy regarding Annabelle's escape was flawed. It failed to consider the critical aspect that the image doesn't depict an escape, therefore accepting the caption at face value without deeper investigation. This resulted in a high confidence score (10) despite a factual inaccuracy.\n\nThe external validation check, utilizing a Snopes article, directly contradicts the caption's claim of Annabelle's escape.  The Snopes article definitively states that the escape claim is false, citing Tony Spera's testimony and the lack of supporting evidence. This external check provided strong evidence against the caption's accuracy, resulting in a high confidence score (10).\n\nThe conflict arises from the internal check's limited scope (image-caption alignment) and the external check's broader perspective, including factual verification using reliable sources. The internal check mainly focused on entity recognition (Annabelle and the museum) rather than verifying the factual accuracy of the entire statement. The external validation is more crucial here because it investigates the truthfulness of the caption's assertion about the doll escaping. \n\nThe discrepancy between the internal and external checks is significant. The internal check's high confidence score is based on a superficial analysis that overlooked the false claim within the caption.  The external check's high confidence score is well-supported by a reputable source debunking the claim.   Given the external evidence, the internal check's assessment is clearly flawed.   \n\nTherefore, considering the strength of the external evidence and the weakness of the internal analysis in regards to the claim made by the caption, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context (OOC: True). The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong evidence provided by the external check and the clear mismatch between the caption and verified facts. The overall validation relies more heavily on the external validation in this scenario as the internal analysis failed to account for the contextual aspects of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows entity alignment (Annabelle, Warren's Occult Museum) but fails to verify the escape claim. External validation, using a Snopes article, strongly refutes the escape claim.  The external evidence is conclusive, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

      "explanation": "While it is plausible that Black Lives Matter may organize transportation for protests, the claim that buses were purchased specifically for the purpose of transporting members to \"riots\" is unverifiable and potentially inflammatory.  The term \"riots\" carries a strong negative connotation.  The statement lacks specific details, making independent verification difficult. There are many documented instances of BLM-organized transportation to protests, but this specific claim requires evidence to confirm.",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check focuses on the alignment between the image and the caption's description of buses associated with Black Lives Matter. It finds this alignment accurate. However, the external check critically evaluates the claim that these buses were purchased to transport members to \"riots.\"  This claim is deemed unverifiable and potentially inflammatory due to the lack of specific details and supporting evidence.  The term \"riots\" is highly charged and introduces a biased interpretation of the image. While the image supports the presence of BLM-branded buses, it doesn't provide evidence to confirm the stated purpose of transporting people specifically to riots.  The discrepancy lies in the caption's assertion regarding the purpose of the buses. The image only shows the existence of the buses and their affiliation with BLM, while the caption makes an additional claim about their usage which lacks external validation.  The high confidence score in the internal check stems from the clear visual representation of the buses, which aligns with the caption's description of BLM-related buses. However, this confidence should not overshadow the lack of evidence for the crucial claim regarding their transportation of members to riots. The low confidence score in the external check reflects the unverifiable nature of the additional claim, therefore outweighing the higher internal confidence. The final conclusion is that the caption is out of context because, while the image shows BLM buses, the caption's statement regarding their purpose as riot transportation is not supported by evidence and is potentially biased.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the image accurately reflects the presence of Black Lives Matter buses.  External check finds the claim of using buses to transport members to \"riots\" unverifiable and potentially inflammatory, lacking supporting evidence.  The caption is deemed out of context due to the unverified additional claim."

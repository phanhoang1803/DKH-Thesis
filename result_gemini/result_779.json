        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows Anderson Cooper laughing uncontrollably after Kellyanne Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts.\"\nIn January 2017, a video was posted to YouTube purportedly showing CNN host Anderson Cooper laughing uncontrollably at Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway after the latter used the phrase \"alternative facts\" during an interview to explain the discrepancies between claimed attendance figures for President Trump's inauguration:\nAlthough the footage of Cooper laughing is real, it was not related to Conway's \"alternative facts\" comment (as should be evident from the multiple obvious cuts and repetitions in the clip).\nThis video was compiled using footage showing Cooper getting the giggles during a 2011 episode of AC360, as the host was reporting on a story about French actor Gerard Depardieu's urinating on a plane:\nThe clip of Conway using the term \"alternative facts\" is also real, although she didn't utter this phrase during an interview with Cooper. The Conway clip was gleaned from a 22 January 2017 Meet the Press interview with Chuck Todd. While Todd was taken aback by Conway's comment, his reaction to it was not to succumb to an uncontrollable fit of the giggles:\nCHUCK TODD: (...) answer the question of why the president asked the White House press secretary to come out in front of the podium for the first time and utter a falsehood? Why did he do that? It undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office ...\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: No it doesn't.\nCHUCK TODD: ... on day one.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What ... you're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that. But the point remains ...\nCHUCK TODD: Wait a minute. Alternative facts?\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: ... that theres ...\nCHUCK TODD: Alternative facts? Four of the five facts he uttered, the one thing he got right ...\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: ... hey, Chuck, why ... Hey Chuck ...\nCHUCK TODD: ... was Zeke Miller. Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\nSources\nSinderbrand, Rebecca. \"How Kellyanne Conway ushered in the era of alternative facts.\" Washington Post. 22 January 2017.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.",

      "explanation": "The claim that CNN host Anderson Cooper laughed uncontrollably at Kellyanne Conway is FALSE. Snopes.com debunks this claim, stating that a video showing Cooper laughing was spliced together from unrelated footage.  The laughter was not in response to Conway using the phrase \"alternative facts\", which was used in a separate interview with Chuck Todd, not Anderson Cooper.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes.com fact-check clearly indicates that the video is a spoof, made by combining unrelated footage of Anderson Cooper laughing from a 2011 episode with a separate clip of Kellyanne Conway using the term \"alternative facts\" in an interview with Chuck Todd in 2017.  The laughter did not occur during any interaction between Cooper and Conway.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no evidence of Anderson Cooper laughing uncontrollably at Kellyanne Conway within the provided image.  The image only shows Anderson Cooper, and there is no presence of Kellyanne Conway. The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects this complete lack of evidence supporting the caption. The external check further strengthens this conclusion by citing a Snopes fact-check.  Snopes definitively debunks the claim, stating that the video in circulation, purporting to show Cooper laughing at Conway's use of \"alternative facts\", is a fabricated compilation of unrelated footage.  This fact-check provides robust external evidence, assigning a confidence score of 10 to its assertion that the claim is false.  The high confidence score of 10 from the external validation, combined with the 0 confidence score from the internal validation, overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is entirely out of context. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they are in complete agreement, both pointing towards a complete lack of evidence supporting the original claim.  The image itself does not show the described action, and reputable external sources explicitly refute the existence of such an interaction.  Considering the decisive and consistent evidence from both internal and external analyses, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is not only valid but highly certain.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image lacks the described interaction, and an external fact-check debunks the claim."

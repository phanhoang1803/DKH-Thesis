The photo, which was taken of Trump with his parents in 1992, has been altered.\nTHE FACTS: The manipulated photo, edited to make it appear Trumps parents are wearing Klan garb, has circulated before on social media. It surfaced again this week on Facebook and Twitter.\nThe original photo was taken by Judie Burstein in 1992, according to Globe Photos, a celebrity and entertainment photo company that archived the image in March 2004.\nThe image shows Trump in a red tie and a black suit standing with his arms wrapped around his mother and father. Mary Trump is wearing a pink and black floral suit, with pearls draped around her neck. Fred Trump is wearing a navy suit, red pocket square and polka dot tie. The three Trumps posed for the photo against a marble wall backdrop and a sign that reads theater tickets.\nTrump followed his father into the real estate business. Fred Trump, who made a fortune in real estate, died in 1999 at the age of 93. Mary Trump died in 2000, at the age of 88.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

    "explanation": "The caption claims that the photograph shows Donald Trump posing with his parents in Ku Klux Klan robes.  Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check examined the image itself. While the clothing of the man on the right resembles a robe, there are no definitive visual markings that confirm it as a KKK robe.  The lack of clear, unambiguous KKK insignia makes the claim unsubstantiated. The confidence score of 3 reflects this uncertainty based solely on visual inspection. \n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check leveraged multiple sources that definitively debunked the caption's assertion.  These sources unanimously agreed that the image was digitally altered. The original photograph, according to these sources, shows the Trump family in regular clothing; the man on the right does not wear a robe.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong consensus among reputable sources refuting the manipulated image. \n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external validation. While the internal check based on visual inspection alone held a low confidence score (3) and only identified the claim as unsubstantiated, the external check provided definitive proof that the image had been manipulated, resulting in a high confidence score of 10.  The external evidence is far more reliable than an individual's visual interpretation given the sophisticated nature of image manipulation. The external sources specifically identify the image as a hoax, making the internal visual check less reliable and more likely to be subject to misinterpretation.\n\nEntity Alignment:\nThe entities in the image are correctly identified as Donald Trump and his parents. The disagreement lies in the interpretation of their attire.  \n\nConclusion:\nThe overwhelming evidence from reputable external sources conclusively demonstrates that the caption is out of context. The image was manipulated.  The original image, corroborated by multiple sources, shows no KKK robes. Therefore, the claim is false.  The final confidence score of 10 reflects the strong agreement among external sources and the clear evidence of image manipulation.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly reject the claim that the image depicts Donald Trump's parents in KKK robes. External sources definitively prove the image is digitally manipulated, while internal visual analysis, though inconclusive, does not support the claim. The final assessment is that the caption is definitively out of context."

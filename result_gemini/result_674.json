In February 2019, for example, the Facebook page \"Inspire Uplift\" shared the image along with the caption \"Meals on Wheels in Canada\":\nThe original photograph (which featured a bear but no biker) can be traced to a September 2014 post on photographer Adonis Arias' Tumblr page. That posting didn't provide much information about the picture other than it was taken in Yellowstone National Park. (We reached out to Arias for more information but did not hear back prior to publication of this story.)\nHere's a look at the original image (right) and the doctored version (left):",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) that the caption accurately reflects the image content.  The image depicts a bear seemingly chasing a cyclist. However, the external check, referencing Snopes, provides strong evidence (confidence score 10) that the image is fabricated; it's a digitally altered image. Snopes confirms the original image contained only a bear and not the cyclist.  This directly contradicts the caption's assertion that the image shows a bear chasing a cyclist. The high confidence scores from both checks, despite their opposing verdicts, highlight a significant discrepancy. The external validation from a reputable fact-checking source like Snopes carries more weight due to its investigative methodology. Therefore, despite the image's visual appearance suggesting the caption's accuracy, the overwhelming external evidence confirms the caption is out of context. The internal check's assessment is only valid based on the visual content of the manipulated image itself.  Because the external evidence reveals a manipulation, the conclusion is that the internal interpretation is inaccurate.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check: High confidence in caption accuracy based on image content. External check (Snopes): High confidence in caption inaccuracy based on image manipulation evidence.  The external validation overrides the internal assessment due to strong evidence of image manipulation."

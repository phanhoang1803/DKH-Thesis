      "explanation": "The caption is plausible. Pubs, restaurants, and cinemas reopening after a lockdown could lead to celebratory (or, conversely, frustrated) behavior.  Pouring a drink on oneself is unusual but not impossible within the context of such an event. However, there's no way to verify the specific incident from the caption alone.",
      "supporting_points": "England did have a lockdown in 2020 and early 2021. Reopening of hospitality venues after such periods was often marked by significant public activity and some instances of unusual behavior. The event described is not inherently contradictory to such a scenario.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score of 10, asserting that the image perfectly aligns with the caption's description. The man pouring liquid on himself in Soho, London is clearly depicted. The external validation, while slightly less confident (score of 8), supports the plausibility of the caption.  The reopening of pubs and restaurants after a lockdown is a verifiable event, and while the man's action is unusual, it's not impossible within the context of such an occasion. There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks. Both agree on the core elementsâ€”the location, the action depicted, and the general timeframe. The external check acknowledges the lack of definitive proof regarding this specific incident but finds the scenario highly plausible given the historical context of lockdown releases.  The combination of high internal and plausible external validation leads to a high overall confidence score.  While we can't definitively verify this was precisely the moment pubs reopened, the image and caption are not inconsistent with the described event.  The absence of contradictory evidence further supports the assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations support the caption's accuracy. The internal check finds perfect alignment between image and caption, while the external check highlights the plausibility of the event described within the context of post-lockdown reopenings in England."

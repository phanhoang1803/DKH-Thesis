      "explanation": "The description of red and blue smoke at a Fourth of July event near the White House is plausible. Fireworks and other pyrotechnics often use colored smoke as part of displays.  However, without visual confirmation from reputable news sources or photographic evidence, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. Therefore, the verdict is True but the confidence score reflects some uncertainty.",
      "supporting_points": "Knowledge of common pyrotechnic practices during celebrations like Independence Day; awareness of the annual Salute to America event held near the White House; understanding that colored smoke is a common element in fireworks shows.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The caption accurately describes the image's content.  Internal validation finds strong alignment between the caption and the image's visual elements: red and blue smoke plumes are prominently displayed in front of what is clearly identifiable as the White House. The context suggests a patriotic celebration, consistent with a Salute to America event during Independence Day.  The internal check's high confidence score of 10 reflects this strong alignment. \n\nExternal validation corroborates the plausibility of the caption.  Colored smoke is a common feature in fireworks displays associated with Independence Day celebrations, particularly events held around the White House. The 'Salute to America' is a known annual event, further supporting the caption's context. While external validation doesn't offer definitive proof (e.g., a news article explicitly mentioning colored smoke at this specific event), the knowledge of typical Independence Day celebrations and the existence of 'Salute to America' provide substantial backing. The external check's confidence score of 8 reflects this degree of certainty, acknowledging the lack of absolute verification.\n\nThere is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both confirm the general plausibility of the caption's claims. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) reinforce the conclusion that the caption is not out of context. While there's a small difference in confidence levels (likely due to the external check's inherent need for verifiable evidence), the overall agreement strongly suggests the caption is appropriate and accurately describes the image. The final confidence score of 9 represents a weighted average reflecting the high agreement and acknowledging the limitations of external verification without direct corroborating evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly support the caption's accuracy.  The image clearly shows red and blue smoke in front of the White House, aligning with the description of a Salute to America event. External knowledge corroborates the plausibility of this event featuring colored smoke, though absolute verification from news sources is lacking."

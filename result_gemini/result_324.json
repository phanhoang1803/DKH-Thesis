      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Felix Tshisekedi did win the 2018 Congolese presidential election. While the exact vote count might need verification against official election records, receiving over seven million votes is within the realm of possibility for a national election.  The description of him as a largely 'untested candidate' at the time is also a fair assessment, given his relatively less prominent political career compared to some other contenders. However, without access to precise election data, I can't definitively confirm the exact vote count. ",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies Felix Tshisekedi as the central figure in the image and acknowledges the relevance of the Electoral Commission to the context, even though it's not visually present.  The external check confirms the core factual accuracy of the caption â€“ that Felix Tshisekedi won the 2018 Congolese election and that his candidacy was considered relatively 'untested' at the time.  There's a minor discrepancy in the vote count; the external check is cautious about precisely verifying the seven million figure without access to official election records. However, the order of magnitude is likely correct, given the scale of a national election.  The external check's confidence is slightly lower than the internal check's because of the need for further verification on the exact vote count. There's no conflict between the internal and external checks; both confirm the fundamental truth of the caption, that Tshisekedi won the election with a significant vote share, and that he wasn't an established political figure prior to his victory.  The high confidence scores from both checks, particularly the internal check's score of 10, strongly support the conclusion that the caption is not out of context.  The slight uncertainty about the precise vote count does not undermine the overall accuracy of the caption. Therefore, the caption accurately represents the image and the associated event. ",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks validate the caption's accuracy.  The internal check focuses on the alignment of entities within the image and the caption's context. The external check verifies the core facts against real-world knowledge of the 2018 Congolese election.  A slight discrepancy about the exact vote count is noted, but it doesn't affect the overall conclusion."

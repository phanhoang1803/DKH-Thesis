      "explanation": "Pastor Rick Scarborough is a known figure who has made controversial statements. While it's possible he made such a statement,  linking breast cancer to \"dirty thoughts\" is not supported by any scientific evidence.  The claim is medically inaccurate and reflects a harmful misconception.  Therefore, while the statement about Scarborough making controversial claims is plausible, the specific claim about breast cancer is highly implausible.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses uncertainty because it cannot verify if the person in the image is Rick Scarborough.  The external check finds the claim highly implausible due to the lack of scientific evidence linking breast cancer to thoughts. While Pastor Rick Scarborough is known for controversial statements, this specific claim is medically inaccurate and reflects a dangerous misconception.  Therefore, both checks agree that there is a significant lack of evidence to support the original caption. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty regarding the identity of the person in the image and the highly implausible nature of the original claim.  The internal check's low confidence score and the external check's low confidence score, combined with the external check's strong arguments against the claim's validity, lead to a final assessment of \"Out Of Context\". There is no support within the image or from external reliable sources to conclude that the caption accurately describes the context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks deem the caption implausible. The image does not verify the identity of the speaker, and the claim about breast cancer is medically inaccurate and lacks scientific support."

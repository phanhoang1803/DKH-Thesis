TCD has received telephone calls from the gullible asking for \"George Soros\" and other Trumpian conspiratorial nonsense.\nIF YOU SEE IT, DO NOT SHARE IT. DO NOT COMMENT ON PAGES THAT SHARE IT. If you do either, you increase its visibility on Facebook (or Twitter, Tik Tok, etc.) and are inadvertently helping to spread false right-wing propaganda of an anti-democratic, anti-Semitic nature. You may be endangering fellow Democrats.\nDO HELP prevent the spread of disruptive nonsense by reporting it to Facebook as FALSE NEWS, and assuring folks that it didnt come from us. Use the 3 dots in the corner of each post, select \"Find Support or Report Post,\" and report it as FALSE NEWS.\nThe images are Nazi-style disinformation intended to incite violence against Democrats. We condemn those who would undermine our democracy by spreading lies to our fellow citizens. Reject lies and embrace reality.\nShare this widely.

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check reveals a significant mismatch between the caption and the image content. The image shows a graffiti artwork; the caption describes a recruitment flyer for \"professional anarchists.\"  The internal check has a confidence score of 0, indicating no alignment between the caption and the image. The external check corroborates this finding with a confidence score of 10. External sources confirm that images claiming to be recruitment flyers for \"professional anarchists\" are fake and part of a disinformation campaign. This disinformation campaign aims to discredit Democrats, further emphasizing the discrepancy between the caption and reality.  Both internal and external checks strongly suggest that the original caption is completely out of context and inaccurate. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and conclusively demonstrate the caption's inaccuracy. The high confidence scores from both checks (0 and 10) strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. Given the overwhelming evidence from both internal image analysis and external fact-checking, there is no ambiguity. The caption is demonstrably false and does not accurately describe the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the conclusion that the original caption is out of context. The internal check found no alignment, and the external check confirmed that the described flyer is part of a disinformation campaign."

        "content": "Claim:\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris threatened to use 'federal law enforcement and the military ... against Trumpers'\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nShortly after Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States on Jan. 20, 2021, the following meme was shared on Facebook. It purported that on her first full day in office, Harris had threatened that \"we will use federal law enforcement and the military\" against \"Trumpers ... [who] will beg me for a loaf of bread\":\nThese Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, its time to end this. They really dont get. We will block them in the courts, we will use federal law enforcement and the military. After Joe inflicts the death blow, Ill take the reigns [sic]. They will beg me for a loaf of bread.\nWe found no documentation that Harris said any such thing, however. Such controversial comments certainly would have been widely reported, yet a simple search turns up not a single related news account. Nor did any similar statement appear in Harris' social media accounts or in White House briefing room statements.\nThe meme claims the statement in question was made on Jan. 21, the first full day of the Biden-Harris administration, but Harris' recorded events that day were speaking briefly to the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting (during which she made no such comments) and participating in a call with World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHarris had delivered her first speech as vice president the day before, on Inauguration Day, but in that address she made no mention of former President Donald Trump or his supporters.\nBecause we could find no evidence whatsoever of this quotation's being legitimate, we rate this item \"False.\"",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows a low confidence score (8) because while the image verifies the presence of Kamala Harris, it does not confirm the claim of a threat.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence (confidence score 10) that the claim is false, citing a Snopes fact-check that debunks the statement.  The external evidence is significantly more reliable as it involves a thorough investigation by a reputable fact-checking organization.  Snopes' investigation found no credible evidence to support the claim in news reports, official statements, or social media. This discrepancy highlights a crucial point: visual evidence alone is insufficient to confirm controversial claims. The image only shows Harris speaking; it doesn't offer proof of the threatening statement itself.  The external check's high confidence score and the lack of supporting evidence for the claim outweigh the internal check's limited visual confirmation.  Therefore, the caption is definitively out of context, with a high confidence score because external, reliable fact-checking confirms the claim's falsity.  The internal check's focus on visual confirmation of the individuals present is insufficient to counter the robust external evidence debunking the core assertion of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially confirms visual elements but not the claim; external check strongly refutes the claim with a reputable fact-check. External evidence is prioritized due to its higher reliability and thoroughness."

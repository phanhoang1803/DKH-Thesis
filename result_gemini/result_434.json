        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows Anderson Cooper laughing uncontrollably after Kellyanne Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts.\"\nIn January 2017, a video was posted to YouTube purportedly showing CNN host Anderson Cooper laughing uncontrollably at Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway after the latter used the phrase \"alternative facts\" during an interview to explain the discrepancies between claimed attendance figures for President Trump's inauguration:\nAlthough the footage of Cooper laughing is real, it was not related to Conway's \"alternative facts\" comment (as should be evident from the multiple obvious cuts and repetitions in the clip).\nThis video was compiled using footage showing Cooper getting the giggles during a 2011 episode of AC360, as the host was reporting on a story about French actor Gerard Depardieu's urinating on a plane:\nThe clip of Conway using the term \"alternative facts\" is also real, although she didn't utter this phrase during an interview with Cooper. The Conway clip was gleaned from a 22 January 2017 Meet the Press interview with Chuck Todd. While Todd was taken aback by Conway's comment, his reaction to it was not to succumb to an uncontrollable fit of the giggles:\nCHUCK TODD: (...) answer the question of why the president asked the White House press secretary to come out in front of the podium for the first time and utter a falsehood? Why did he do that? It undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office ...\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: No it doesn't.\nCHUCK TODD: ... on day one.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. What ... you're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that. But the point remains ...\nCHUCK TODD: Wait a minute. Alternative facts?\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: ... that theres ...\nCHUCK TODD: Alternative facts? Four of the five facts he uttered, the one thing he got right ...\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: ... hey, Chuck, why ... Hey Chuck ...\nCHUCK TODD: ... was Zeke Miller. Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\nSources\nSinderbrand, Rebecca. \"How Kellyanne Conway ushered in the era of alternative facts.\" Washington Post. 22 January 2017.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check reveals a mismatch between the caption's claim and the image's content; the image only shows Anderson Cooper, while the caption mentions both Anderson Cooper and Kellyanne Conway.  The external check provides definitive evidence that the video described in the caption is a fabricated spoof, directly contradicting the caption's assertion.  The high confidence scores (10/10) from both checks, combined with the clear discrepancy in the described video's content, solidify the conclusion that the caption is out of context. There is no ambiguity or conflict between the internal and external validations; both independently and decisively point towards the caption's inaccuracy. The external check's supporting point explicitly states that the video is a spoof, which is the reason for the discrepancy in the claim and the provided image.  The image only shows Anderson Cooper, making it impossible to visually verify the interaction described in the caption.  The absence of Kellyanne Conway in the image already raises a red flag, but the external confirmation that the video is a fabrication completely invalidates the caption's claim. The caption's description of Anderson Cooper's reaction to Kellyanne Conway's use of \"alternative facts\" is unsupported by the provided image and demonstrably false based on the external evidence. Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is exceptionally robust and reliable, justifying a high confidence score of 10.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks independently and decisively confirm that the caption is out of context. The image lacks Kellyanne Conway, and the video is confirmed to be a spoof, contradicting the caption's description."

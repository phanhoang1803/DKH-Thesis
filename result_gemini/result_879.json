      "explanation": "While eagles are powerful birds of prey capable of catching fish, the claim of an eagle carrying a shark is highly unusual due to the size and weight of a shark, especially one large enough to be noticeable in a video.  The virality of the video on social media doesn't confirm its authenticity.  Therefore, the claim needs further verification to confirm whether it actually happened.  Many viral videos are hoaxes or misrepresentations.",
      "supporting_points": "- Eagles are birds of prey, but their typical prey is much smaller than sharks.\n- Sharks vary in size, but even small sharks would be a significant weight for an eagle to carry.\n- Viral videos are not always authentic.",

    "confidence_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) based on the visual alignment between the image and the caption's description of an eagle carrying what seems to be a shark.  However, the external check expresses low confidence (4), raising concerns about the plausibility of the event depicted.  The external check highlights that while eagles are capable of catching fish, the size and weight of even a small shark would be unusually challenging for an eagle to carry.  The external check also points out that the virality of the video on social media is not sufficient proof of authenticity.  The discrepancy arises from the limitations of the internal check, which is primarily based on a visual assessment of a single image and cannot easily verify contextual details like the temporal element (July 2020) and the scale and weight of the shark.  The external check provides a more critical analysis based on biological plausibility and the common issues with viral videos.  While the image indeed shows an eagle carrying a fish-like object, the external concerns about the weight, size, and common misrepresentation in viral videos are significant enough to doubt the caption's complete accuracy.  Therefore, weighing both scores and considering the external evaluation's strong points, we conclude the caption might be out of context, or at least requires further confirmation to assure its accuracy.  This highlights a case where high confidence in internal consistency does not automatically translate to high confidence in overall accuracy when faced with contradictory external evidence that raises reasonable doubts.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in visual alignment but lacks contextual verification. External check expresses low confidence due to biological implausibility and common viral video misrepresentations.  Discrepancy resolved by weighing evidence and prioritizing external concerns about plausibility and authenticity."

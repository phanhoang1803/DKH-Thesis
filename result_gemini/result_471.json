        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a 9-year-old girl who was impregnated by a Muslim man.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image of a young child in Brazil with an enlarged liver and spleen is frequently used by internet trolls to spread Islamophobic rumors. On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

      "explanation": "The claim in the news caption is directly contradicted by the evidence from Snopes. Snopes explicitly states that the photograph is miscaptioned and does not show a pregnant child.  The image was actually of a girl with liver and spleen problems. The claim that a Muslim man impregnated her is false.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Snopes article debunks the claim, stating the image is miscaptioned and shows a girl with health problems, not a pregnant child. The claim linking the girl's condition to a Muslim man is identified as an Islamophobic rumor.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no visual evidence in the image to support the claim of a 9-year-old girl being impregnated by a Muslim man.  The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete lack of visual support for the caption's assertion. The external check provides strong evidence from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, which definitively debunks the claim. Snopes reports that the image is miscaptioned and actually depicts a young girl suffering from medical issues involving her liver and spleen. The claim of impregnation by a Muslim man is explicitly labeled as a false and Islamophobic rumor. The high confidence score of 10 from the external check stems from Snopes's thorough investigation and direct refutation of the caption's narrative. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently arrive at the same conclusion: the caption is completely inaccurate and misleading.  The external evidence significantly strengthens the assessment, given the credibility of the source (Snopes). Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is highly certain, reflected in the confidence score of 10.  In summary, the available evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the image and caption are unrelated, and the caption is a fabrication.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal analysis finds no visual evidence to support the caption, while the external check cites Snopes's fact-check, which refutes the claim and identifies it as a false and Islamophobic rumor.  There is complete agreement between the two validation methods, leading to a high confidence score."

        "content": "Claim:\nPilot Flying J is removing American flags from their truck stop flagpoles because the flags \"offend foreigners.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 5 May 2018, Facebook user Dave Moore uploaded a video from a Pilot Flying J truck stop in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that a flagless Flying J location it displayed was the result of the company's attempt to placate \"foreigners\" who would otherwise be offended by the sight of an American flag in the United States (for reasons he did not explicate):\nMoore described (but did not film) a interaction with an unspecified employee who, according to him, openly stated that non-American customers requested that the flag be removed: \"I went inside the Pilot and I asked them ... they said they had an issue with foreigners coming here and complaining, and they didn't want to lose the foreigners' business so they took it down.\"\nIn fact the clip did not corroborate his claim, despite being made directly in front of the Pilot Flying J where he claimed the interaction took place. Although he shot a video directly after the purported conversation, he apparently didn't capture evidence that it happened as described (or at all).\nGas stations are frequently targeted for rumors of insufficient patriotism and various versions of the \"Shunned Serviceman\" urban legend. Modern (mostly invented) repetitions of the such rumors have circulated in Illinois, on Long Island, and in Holly, Michigan.\nIn some e-mailed variations of this rumor which we received, readers asked if Pilot Flying J had announced that they would be removing all American flags, everywhere:\nPilot and Flying J truck stops announced they were taking down the American Flag. They started the American Flag was offensive to the foreign truck drivers. Well screw them I will not stop or use these truck stops or gas stations ever again. I cut up my Pilot rewards gas card.\nAs is often the case with claims about \"offensive\" American flags or unpatriotic gas stations, Moore's story spread quickly, accruing nearly three million views in under a week. One day after it was posted, Pilot Flying J addressed the rumor on social media, stating that the store in question lacked a U.S. flag because a damaged flagpole there was in the process of being repaired:\nIn their Facebook post, Pilot Flying J reported that a \"team member was misinformed,\" but the company did not provide any more detail about the nature of that misinformation.\nA public relations firm representing Flying J sent us a response to our inquiry about the issue which stated that:\nI want to re-iterate that the current policy is that an American flag can only be displayed at our locations if it can be flown according to military protocol. The flag at store #436 in Amarillo, TX was not being flown as the pole is broken and prevents the flag being flown according to protocol.\nWe apologize the store manager did not have this information. We are still investigating all the details behind this miscommunication, but what we can tell you is what the situation at hand truly is, and that we are working to fix the pole at this location and are currently surveying our locations with flag poles to review if they are in proper working condition.",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that Pilot and Flying J truck stops removed American flags because they were offensive to foreign truck drivers.  The internal check assesses the image, which shows a Pilot gas station and does not contain any information about the removal of flags or any statement regarding flags being offensive. This results in a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False. The external check reveals that while a claim regarding Pilot Flying J removing flags due to complaints from foreign drivers circulated, this claim was later refuted. The actual reason given was a broken flagpole.  The external check gives a confidence score of 8 and a verdict of False. Although the external check found evidence suggesting the caption was false, it also acknowledged that the false claim did exist.  The discrepancies between internal and external checks highlight the limitations of using visual evidence alone to verify claims involving events outside of the image's scope.  The internal check only focuses on what is directly seen.  The external check looks at news reports that show a claim in circulation even though the claim was disproved.   Given the strong disagreement and the fact that the image provides no direct evidence related to the flag removal claim or the offensive nature of the flags, the caption is deemed out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks indicate that the caption is out of context. The image shows a Pilot gas station, but the caption discusses Pilot and Flying J removing American flags due to offense to foreign drivers. External verification reveals that while a false claim to that effect circulated, it was not true."

      "supporting_points": "- House collapses can and do happen, resulting in injuries or deaths.\n- Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester is a verifiable location.\n- A 61-year-old woman is within a typical age range.\n- The event described is consistent with the type of news that is regularly reported.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's accuracy.  The internal check notes the image depicts a collapsed house, aligning with the caption's description of a house collapse. While the precise location within Greater Manchester can't be definitively verified from the image alone, Ramsbottom is a plausible location, making the internal alignment high. The external check focuses on the plausibility of the event and the information provided. House collapses leading to fatalities are unfortunately common, and the age and location mentioned are verifiable. The lack of independent verification of this *specific* news event doesn't negate the overall plausibility, leading to a high confidence score in the external check.\n\nBoth checks give high confidence scores (10 and 8 respectively), indicating strong support for the caption's accuracy. There are no significant discrepancies. While the image lacks details to pinpoint Ramsbottom precisely, this limitation doesn't invalidate the overall alignment with the caption's description. The external check acknowledges the inability to independently verify the exact news report, but the event plausibility and verifiable location/age data outweigh this limitation.\n\nIn summary, the weight of evidence from both internal and external checks strongly supports the caption's accuracy. The high confidence scores and lack of significant discrepancies confirm that the caption is not out of context. The slightly lower external confidence score acknowledges the limitation of not having direct verification of the specific news report, but the high plausibility and verifiable elements compensate for this.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. High confidence scores (10 and 8) and the absence of significant discrepancies confirm alignment between the image and the caption's description of a house collapse resulting in a fatality. The plausibility of the described event and the verifiability of the location and age information further strengthen the validation."

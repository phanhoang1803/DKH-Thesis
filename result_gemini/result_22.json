The entities 'Tom Moore' (person), 'Piccadilly Circus' (location), and 'London' (location) are all clearly visible and correctly identified. The entity 'NHS' is mentioned in the caption but not directly visible in the image, therefore it cannot be directly verified.  The entity 'PS' (presumably representing pounds sterling) is also only mentioned in the caption and not shown in the image. Overall, the caption's entities align with what's visually presented in the image.",

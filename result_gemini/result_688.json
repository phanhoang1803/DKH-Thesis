    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check notes the woman in the image appears to be Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, aligning with the caption's description of the festival's significance within that faith. The external check provides direct textual evidence from a reliable source confirming that the Meskel festival commemorates the discovery of the cross upon which Jesus was crucified, as stated in the caption.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external assessments. The high confidence scores (8 and 10) from both checks, combined with the strong alignment of the image content and caption description, lead to a high overall confidence in the caption's accuracy. The image, while not explicitly showing the festival itself, depicts a person in what appears to be attire consistent with Ethiopian Orthodox Christian practice, holding a candle, which could be interpreted as relevant to a religious celebration.  This visual context, while not definitive proof, adds to the plausibility of the caption.  The external source's direct corroboration is the strongest piece of evidence, ensuring the caption aligns with established knowledge about the Meskel festival. Therefore, the caption accurately reflects the context of the image and the festival it describes.",

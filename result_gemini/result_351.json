    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 4,
      "explanation": "The claim is plausible in that videos of unidentified objects in the sky frequently circulate on social media, and New Jersey is a populated area where such sightings might be reported.  However, there's no independent verification of the claim that the object in question was an alien spaceship.  Many videos of UFOs turn out to be misidentified objects or hoaxes. Therefore, a verdict of 'True' would depend on external verification which is not available in this context.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context.  The internal check has a confidence score of 3, identifying that the image depicts a Goodyear Blimp, not an alien spaceship or UFO, and noting the absence of TikTok and New Jersey in the image. This analysis is sound and directly addresses the visual content. The external check, with a higher confidence score of 4, acknowledges the plausibility of UFO videos circulating on TikTok and mentions of sightings in New Jersey. However, it emphasizes the lack of independent verification for the specific claim, indicating the inherent difficulty in verifying such claims without external evidence. This aligns perfectly with the internal analysis, as there is nothing in the image to support the caption's claim. Both checks agree that the claim is unsupported by the image provided. While the external check explores the possibility of such videos existing online, it does not counter the core finding that the image itself depicts a Goodyear Blimp, and therefore does not support the claim of an alien spaceship in New Jersey.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both concur that the caption inaccurately describes the visual content. The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong agreement and lack of contradictory evidence.  In essence, the image shows a Goodyear Blimp, which is demonstrably not an alien spaceship, and the caption's claim lacks verifiable external support.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks decisively show the caption is out of context. The image is of a Goodyear Blimp, not a UFO, and lacks evidence to support the claims about TikTok or New Jersey."

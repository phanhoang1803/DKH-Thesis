It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

The claim originated as a social media meme with inaccurate information, and it is explicitly stated that the meme's reference to metric units suggests the claim was not about the United States.  Furthermore,  while the UK considered similar legislation, it was delayed and only affected manufacturers, not existing users of backless boosters. The Snopes article provides detailed evidence disproving the claim.",

    "explanation": "The original caption, \"Backless boosters will be banned in the United States starting in December 2016,\" is completely out of context with the provided image. The image depicts a child being properly secured in a car seat with the help of an adult.  There is no mention of backless boosters, nor any reference to a ban in the US starting in December 2016 within the image itself. The internal check correctly identifies this discrepancy, assigning a confidence score of 0 due to the lack of any connection between the caption and the visual content. \n\nThe external check significantly strengthens this assessment.  It provides evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, that directly debunks the claim made in the caption. Snopes thoroughly investigates the origin and spread of the false claim, demonstrating its inaccurate nature and highlighting its origin as a social media meme. The external check's high confidence score (10) reinforces the internal check's finding.  Snopes details how the claim used metric units, hinting at a non-US origin, and how it was inaccurately reported in some local news sources. Further, the external check points out that even in the UK, where similar legislation was considered, the impact was limited to manufacturers of new products, not affecting existing users of backless boosters.  The external check thoroughly investigates and refutes the captionâ€™s core assertion. \n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. Both conclude that the caption is factually incorrect and unrelated to the image. The high confidence score from the external check, supported by the internal check's lack of support for the caption, strongly suggests that the caption is indeed out of context. No discrepancies are found, and the external evidence conclusively shows the caption is false. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context with a high level of confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context. The internal check finds no connection between the image and the caption, while the external check uses Snopes.com to definitively disprove the caption's factual claims.  There is complete agreement and high confidence in the conclusion."

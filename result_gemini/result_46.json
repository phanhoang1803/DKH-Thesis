      "explanation": "While it is possible for a train to crash through a barrier, the specific scenario of it landing on a whale art installation is highly improbable and lacks evidence.  The plausibility hinges entirely on the existence of such an art installation at a train terminal in Spijkenisse.  Without verification of this specific detail, the overall claim remains unlikely.",
      "supporting_points": "- Trains can have accidents resulting in them going beyond the end of tracks. \n- Spijkenisse is a real city in the Netherlands.\n- Large-scale art installations are possible in public spaces.\n- However, the combination of these elements is unusual and requires verification.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 5,
    "explanation": "The internal check exhibits high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy, primarily due to the clear visual evidence of a train on a whale-shaped art installation. The explanation focuses on the image's direct depiction and confirms the location as Spijkenisse, Netherlands, implicitly validating the scenario. However, the external check expresses low confidence (score 4), highlighting the implausibility of such an event.  The external check points out the unusual nature of the event and the lack of independent evidence to support the claim. This discrepancy arises from a difference in perspectives: The internal check prioritizes the image's direct visual information, while the external check considers the broader context and probability of such an event occurring.  The external check emphasizes the need for corroborating evidence beyond the image itself. This lack of supporting evidence from reliable news sources or official reports significantly weakens the overall certainty of the caption's accuracy. To resolve the conflict, it is essential to consider the external check's concerns regarding the unusual nature of the event. The absence of widespread reporting about a train crashing onto a whale sculpture in Spijkenisse casts doubt on the claim's veracity. While the image itself is compelling, the lack of external verification necessitates a conservative judgment. Therefore, the overall confidence is reduced from the internal check's high score to a more moderate score, reflecting the uncertainty caused by the conflicting views of internal and external validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption due to the image's clear depiction of the event. External validation expresses skepticism, citing the implausibility of the event and lack of supporting evidence.  This discrepancy leads to a lower overall confidence score and the conclusion that the caption may be out of context."

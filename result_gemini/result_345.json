      "explanation": "The statement is plausible. Martin Fayulu is a known Congolese politician who frequently addresses supporters.  The sentiment expressed aligns with the kind of rhetoric used by political figures in similar situations. However, without specific details about the event (e.g., a news article confirming the speech), it is not possible to definitively verify the caption's accuracy.",

  },
  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows Martin Fayulu addressing a crowd, consistent with the caption's description. The external check also provides a positive verdict (confidence score of 8), noting that the statement is plausible given Fayulu's political role and typical political rhetoric. The external check's lower confidence stems from the lack of independent verification of the specific event described (the speech on Friday in Kinshasa). While the external check acknowledges a lack of absolute certainty, this does not contradict the internal check's assessment. Both checks agree on the core elements of the caption: the presence of Martin Fayulu, his interaction with a crowd, and the likely location in Kinshasa. The discrepancy in confidence scores reflects the difference between directly observable evidence (image analysis) and the need for additional external sources to corroborate the specific date and statement. Considering the high confidence of the internal check and the plausible nature of the external check's information, the caption is considered largely accurate. The slight reduction in the overall confidence score reflects the absence of complete external verification of the exact date and quote.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with the internal check showing higher confidence due to direct image analysis. The external check acknowledges the plausibility but lacks complete verification of the specific event, resulting in a slightly lower confidence score."

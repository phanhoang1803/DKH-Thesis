      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  Museums frequently display and maintain dinosaur skeletons, including replicas. The Great North Museum: Hancock in Newcastle upon Tyne is a real museum, and it's reasonable to assume they might have a Tyrannosaurus Rex replica.  However, without specific confirmation from the museum's records or news sources, we can't be entirely certain this specific event occurred.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check gives a high confidence score of 10, stating that the image aligns perfectly with the caption, showing a T-Rex skeleton being cleaned at the specified museum. The external validation check provides a score of 8, indicating that the statement is plausible because museums do exhibit dinosaur skeletons and cleaning is routine. However, it lacks absolute certainty due to a lack of specific confirmation from the museum's records or news articles.  There's no significant conflict between the two checks; they both support the caption's accuracy. The external check's slight hesitancy stems from the absence of definitive external evidence, not from any inconsistencies with the image.  The image itself strongly supports the caption.  Therefore, given the high internal confidence and the plausible external validation, we can confidently assert that the caption is not out of context. The slight reduction in the overall confidence score reflects the absence of definitive external proof, such as a news report or museum announcement, confirming the specific cleaning event. This does not negate the likelihood of the event, especially given the strong visual evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy.  Internal check gives high confidence based on image-caption alignment. External check is slightly less confident due to lack of explicit external evidence, but finds the scenario plausible. No major discrepancies; final confidence is high but slightly reduced to reflect lack of definitive external proof."

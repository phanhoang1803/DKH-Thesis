    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses some doubt due to the lack of explicit location and human presence in the image. However, the external check strongly supports the caption's claim, citing the known behavior of gannets and the geographical context of Troup Head in Aberdeenshire, a known gannet colony. The external check provides strong supporting points, emphasizing the predatory nature of gannets, their opportunistic feeding habits, and their tendency to steal fish from fishing boats.  The high confidence score (8) of the external check outweighs the lower confidence score (7) of the internal check. While the image doesn't definitively prove the gannets were attempting to raid the boat, the caption's alignment with known gannet behavior and the location makes it a highly plausible scenario. There's no major discrepancy between the checks; the internal check's reservations are addressed and overridden by the external check's compelling evidence.  The internal check's lack of visual confirmation of the location and the absence of a person in the photo are minor limitations; they do not invalidate the overall plausibility of the caption.  The absence of a person is irrelevant; it's the relationship between the gannets and the fishing boat that is the focus of the caption and it is supported by the knowledge of gannet behavior.  The external validation leverages established knowledge and common sense to support the caption. The final assessment thus leans heavily towards accepting the caption's description. Overall, the caption accurately represents the context given the available evidence, making it a believable description of the scene even without explicit visual evidence of the gannet's intentions or the exact location.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows low confidence due to lack of explicit location and human presence in the image; External check shows high confidence due to alignment with known gannet behavior and geographical context. External evidence outweighs internal reservations, leading to a conclusion that the caption is not out of context."

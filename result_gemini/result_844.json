    "explanation": "The original caption claims that \"Thousands of protesters in Banja Luka rally to demand \"Justice for David\" in April 2018.\"  Both the internal and external checks raise significant doubts about the caption's accuracy. The internal check highlights that while the image depicts a protest with signs, there's no visual confirmation of \"Justice for David\" demands or the specific location of Banja Luka.  The low confidence score (8) reflects this lack of visual evidence. The external check further weakens the claim by stating that while a protest of this nature in that location is plausible, there's insufficient readily available evidence to confirm the event, its scale (\"thousands\"), or the specific demand for \"Justice for David.\" The low confidence score (4) emphasizes the need for further verification from news archives or local Bosnian sources.  The discrepancies between the internal and external checks are not severe, both agreeing on the lack of sufficient evidence. The low confidence scores from both checks indicate a high level of uncertainty. Considering the absence of strong supporting evidence and the low confidence levels from both analyses, the caption is deemed out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks cast doubt on the caption's accuracy.  The image lacks visual confirmation of the claim, and external sources provide no readily available evidence to support the described protest.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context."

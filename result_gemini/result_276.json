      "explanation": "The image shows a goose sheltering a puppy with its wings.  The location Montana is not shown in the image, and there is no indication that the goose is stuck to a pole or shaking with cold.  Therefore, the caption is not supported by the image.",

      "explanation": "The scenario is plausible.  Animals seeking shelter from extreme cold is realistic. A goose sheltering a smaller animal is less common but not impossible, particularly if the goose had a maternal instinct or felt empathy. The location (Montana) is appropriate, given its cold winters. However, there's no way to verify this specific event without further evidence.  The 'surprise is capital' is subjective and vague, adding some uncertainty.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check finds the caption to be out of context with a confidence score of 0, primarily because the image lacks evidence supporting the claims of the goose being stuck to a pole, shaking with cold, or the event happening in Montana.  The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario (animals seeking shelter, animals exhibiting unusual protective behavior, Montana's cold winters), assigns a confidence score of 7 due to the lack of specific, verifiable details supporting this particular instance.  The key discrepancy lies in the lack of visual evidence for the crucial elements in the caption: the goose being stuck to a pole, shaking with cold, and the precise location being Montana. While the external check allows for the possibility of the goose sheltering a puppy, the absence of corroborating evidence from the image itself makes the overall claim unreliable. The image simply depicts a goose with a puppy nestled under its wings; it does not confirm any of the specific details mentioned in the caption.  The external check's higher score is based on the general plausibility of the described scenario, not the specifics of the image. Therefore, considering both internal and external analyses, and prioritizing the lack of visual evidence from the image itself, the caption is deemed out of context. The confidence score is moderate (4) reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the discrepancy between plausibility and visual evidence.  In summary, the image lacks specific evidence to support the claims about the goose's condition, its location, and the broader context of the situation. Although such events could realistically happen, the caption's claims are not sufficiently validated by the provided image.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly rejects the caption (confidence: 0), while the external check acknowledges plausibility but lacks specific evidence (confidence: 7). The lack of visual corroboration for key details in the caption leads to the overall conclusion that the caption is out of context."

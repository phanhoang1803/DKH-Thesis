      "explanation": "The news caption is factually incorrect. Stephen Hawking, while having expressed agnostic views, did not make a statement of faith in God before his death.  There's no verifiable evidence he visited the Vatican and declared belief in God after receiving a blessing from the Pope.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal consistency check gives a high confidence score (10) because the caption aligns well with the image content.  The image depicts Stephen Hawking appearing to meet the Pope at the Vatican. The caption describes a scenario consistent with this visual information. However, the external validation check reveals a significant discrepancy, assigning a low confidence score (2). It indicates that the core claim – Stephen Hawking declaring belief in God after receiving a papal blessing – is factually incorrect.  Reputable sources and biographical information do not support this event. This conflict requires careful consideration. The high internal score reflects only the alignment between the caption and the image, without considering the factual accuracy of the statement made. The low external score, based on verified evidence, points to the falsity of the core claim made in the caption.  Therefore, the external validation should be considered more trustworthy, as it's based on established facts rather than mere visual interpretation. Because widely available biographical information and news reporting contradict the caption's main assertion, the caption is considered out of context. The weight is given to the external check because its conclusion is based on widely accessible and verifiable evidence related to Stephen Hawking's views and life events.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high consistency between caption and image. External check reveals factual inaccuracy of caption's core claim.  The external check is given more weight, leading to an 'out of context' conclusion."

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check displays high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy, primarily because the image clearly shows a Lime scooter, and the urban setting aligns with San Francisco. The external check also shows confidence (8), confirming Lime's presence in San Francisco during April 2018 and the Embarcadero's existence. While the external check doesn't directly verify the image's content, the corroborating information strengthens the internal assessment.  The slight discrepancy in confidence scores stems from the external check's inability to visually confirm the image's location and date. However, given that the image shows a Lime scooter, a type of vehicle known to have operated in San Francisco around that time, and the visual context points towards an urban environment, the external factors align well with the internal assessment. No conflicts arise between the internal and external checks, and both independently support the caption's plausibility. Considering both high confidence scores and the lack of conflicting evidence, the caption is highly likely to accurately represent the image's context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with high confidence scores. The minor difference in scores is attributed to the external check's inability to visually confirm image details. However, the overall alignment strongly suggests the caption is in context."

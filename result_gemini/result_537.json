      "explanation": "The statement that the Annabelle doll was used in \"The Conjuring\" and \"Annabelle\" franchises is factually plausible.  The Annabelle movies are horror films based on the purportedly haunted doll. While the exact doll used in the films may not be the same as the one in the lore (which is currently in a locked case at Ed and Lorraine Warren's Occult Museum), the films center around a doll with that name and similar characteristics. The caption is not explicitly false but there is an element of loose terminology.  The real Annabelle doll is not directly used in the films themselves.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows the Annabelle doll, and the caption accurately states its use in the \"The Conjuring\" and \"Annabelle\" franchises. The external check also gives a relatively high confidence score (8), acknowledging that the statement is plausible, but highlighting a nuance: the films use a prop doll, not the actual doll from the lore. The external check's supporting points further clarify this distinction, mentioning the fictional nature of the movies and the existence of a separate \"real\" Annabelle doll.  While there's a slight discrepancy in the exact meaning of \"used\", with the internal check interpreting it more loosely and the external check more literally, both agree the caption isn't entirely wrong. The core idea that the Annabelle doll is central to these franchises is valid. The discrepancy is minor, concerning the literal use of the same doll versus the use of similar-looking props inspired by its lore. The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the understanding of the minor semantic difference, make the caption reasonably accurate within the context of film production and popular culture.  The caption does not claim the *exact same* doll was used, only that the *Annabelle doll* was used in the franchise. This is true in a broader sense, even though a replica was used in the filming.  Therefore, the caption is considered contextually accurate. The external check's points about the real Annabelle doll being in a locked case provides additional information but does not invalidate the caption's assertion regarding the use of the Annabelle doll character and its depiction in the film franchise.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is accurate, although the external check notes a nuance in the interpretation of \"used.\" The internal check focuses on the visual alignment and the general association with the franchise; the external check clarifies the distinction between the film prop and the actual purportedly haunted doll. The overall agreement, with high confidence scores from both checks, leads to a conclusion that the caption is not out of context."

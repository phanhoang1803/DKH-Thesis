Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted a video that showed people being asked to locate any country on an unlabeled world map  with each person failing at that seemingly simple task:\nCruz's added commentary in his tweet, which began with \"This is Bernies base,\" implied  if not directly asserted  that the persons shown in the video were supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders:\nThis is Bernies base  the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.\nHowever, the video tweeted by Cruz was taken from a comedy segment taped for the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live late night talk show back in 2018, before Sanders entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More important, as Kimmel himself stated in response to Cruz's tweet, the persons shown in the video were randomly selected off the street and were not identified as Democrats or Sanders supporters in the segment  no one involved with the show questioned them about, or was aware of, whatever political affiliations they might have held.\nKimmel's crew then revisited that subject for his Feb. 26, 2020, show and compiled a clip of persons who explicitly identified themselves as Republicans (or as non-Sanders supporters) failing at the task of correctly identifying a single country on a world map:",

      "explanation": "The provided text claims that a video shows Bernie Sanders supporters failing to identify countries on a map.  Snopes.com disputes this, stating the video was from a comedy segment with randomly selected people, not identified as Sanders supporters.  The evidence directly contradicts the claim.",

    "explanation": "The internal check identifies a discrepancy: the caption claims the video shows Bernie Sanders supporters, while the video shows only one individual. The internal check gives a low confidence score (10) due to insufficient evidence. The external check strongly refutes the caption, stating that the video is from a comedy segment and participants were not identified as Sanders supporters.  Snopes.com provides a strong counter-argument with supporting evidence.  The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the externally verified information from Snopes.com, which has a higher confidence score (2) than the internal check.  The external evidence directly contradicts the caption's claim about Bernie Sanders supporters and provides an alternative explanation based on the video's context as a comedy segment, thereby demonstrating that the caption is significantly out of context.  The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong external evidence and the resolution of the internal/external conflict, emphasizing the inaccuracy of the original caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks discredit the caption. The internal check finds insufficient evidence to support the claim about Sanders supporters, while the external check directly refutes the claim with evidence from Snopes.com, indicating that the video was part of a comedy segment and participants were not identified as Sanders supporters. The external evidence is conclusive, leading to a high confidence score that the caption is out of context."

    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows Don Moen, aligning with the caption's claim about him. However, the external check has a lower confidence score (7) due to the lack of verifiable information confirming a Kigali performance.  While Don Moen's status as a world-famous praise and worship leader makes the claim plausible and international tours are common, there's no concrete evidence to support the specific detail about a Kigali concert. The discrepancy arises because the internal check focuses solely on the image's content, while the external check considers the broader context and requires verifiable sources. Since the caption's key assertion (the Kigali concert) lacks external verification despite the image's internal consistency, the overall confidence is lowered. The absence of readily available information about a planned Kigali performance, despite the plausibility of Don Moen touring internationally, results in a final verdict of 'out of context'.  The high internal score reflects only the image's contents, not the validity of the future event mentioned in the caption. To resolve this discrepancy, one would need additional evidence, such as news articles, concert announcements, or official statements from Don Moen's management confirming the planned Kigali performance. Without such evidence, the claim remains unverified despite the image's strong internal validation.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the image's content (Don Moen), but external validation fails to confirm the concert in Kigali. The discrepancy highlights the need for external verification of future events, even when the image's contents are internally consistent."

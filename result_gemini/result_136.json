The claim about support for Brexit falling below 50% is plausible, as polls during that period showed fluctuating support, sometimes below 50%. However, I cannot verify this specific polling data without further information. Therefore, the overall statement is plausible but not entirely verifiable.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10 because the image clearly shows Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street, aligning with the caption's description. The mention of Brexit is contextually relevant, even if not explicitly visual.  The external check provides a slightly lower confidence score of 8. While it confirms Theresa May's Brexit deal announcement outside 10 Downing Street and the general timeframe (November), it notes uncertainty regarding the precise claim about Brexit support falling below 50%.  This uncertainty stems from the need for specific polling data to verify the claim.  However, the external check acknowledges the plausibility of the statement, given the fluctuating nature of public opinion on Brexit during that period. There is no major discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both agree on the core elements of the caption: Theresa May, 10 Downing Street, Brexit announcement. The only difference lies in the verifiability of the polling data, which is not directly depicted in the image and therefore not a critical element for assessing the caption's accuracy concerning the core event.  Considering the high confidence score from the internal check (which directly assesses the image-caption alignment) and the plausibility supported by the external check, the overall confidence is high, reflected in a confidence score of 9.  The caption is not out of context; it accurately captures the main event shown in the image, even with the minor uncertainty regarding the specific polling data.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy.  Internal check confirms image-caption alignment; external check verifies the main event but expresses uncertainty about a specific polling data claim.  Overall, the caption is deemed accurate with high confidence."

        "content": "Claim:\nAn episode of \"The Simpsons\" predicted that U.S. President Donald Trump would cancel his trip to Denmark after the prime minister refused to sell Greenland to the United States.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nThe animated show \"The Simpsons\" has garnered a reputation for \"predicting\" future events during the course of its nearly 30-year run. While a few odd coincidences exist, Simpsons prediction hoaxes may outnumber actual Simpsons predictions.\nFor example, \"The Simpsons\" did not predict that U.S. President Donald Trump would ride down an escalator while announcing his bid for president; Lady Gaga's Superbowl halftime show; the video game Pokemon Go; the fire at Notre Dame cathedral; a mass shooting during a screening of \"Black Panther\"; Trump's touching a glowing orb; or Trump's death.\nIn August 2019, after Trump mulled the idea of buying Greenland and then announced that he was canceling a trip to the area after Denmark's prime minister rejected the idea, another Simpsons \"prediction\" started to circulate on social media.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a message on Twitter about how the animated show had predicted the kerfuffle.\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow made a similar joke on Twitter:\nWhile these tweets were likely posted in jest, some people didn't quite get the joke. At least two threads were started on \"The Simpsons\" section of Reddit asking if the prediction was real, and multiple people chimed in on Twitter about the show's uncanny ability to tell the future. Murphy's tweet was also shared on Fark as proof that \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening had a time machine.\nWe searched Frinkiac, a website named after the Simpsons' bumbling mad-scientist character Professor Frink. The site allows fans to search the show's archives for favorite quotes and jokes. And nothing surfaced for mentions of the words \"Greenland,\" \"Trump,\" and \"Denmark\" together.\nFurthermore, we've previously covered the show's \"predictions\" about Trump's presidency. And as far as we can tell, the first mention of a \"President Trump\" came during the season 11 episode, \"Bart to the Future,\" in 2000. Trump was mentioned in prior seasons, but never as president or a potential buyer of Greenland:",

    "explanation": "The internal consistency check reveals a significant mismatch between the image content and the caption's description. The image shows Matt Groening holding a Simpsons pillow; the caption discusses a Simpsons episode predicting a Trump-related event involving Greenland and Denmark. These are unrelated topics. The external check strongly supports the internal assessment by confirming the claim's falsity through a fact-check from a reliable source (Snopes), which further corroborates the lack of evidence supporting the caption's assertion. Both internal and external checks strongly indicate the caption's inaccuracy and its inappropriateness as a description for the given image.  The high confidence scores from both checks (0 from internal and 10 from external), despite the difference in numerical values which is likely caused by the difference in how confidence was expressed, are strongly aligned. The numerical differences can be explained by the fact that the internal check is limited by only looking at the image and caption provided, while the external check is capable of accessing and evaluating information from external sources. Thus, given the overwhelming evidence from both checks, we can conclude that the caption is entirely out of context with respect to the image.",

The image depicts Matt Groening with a Simpsons pillow, while the caption describes a purported Simpsons prediction about Donald Trump and Greenland, which is factually incorrect according to external verification."

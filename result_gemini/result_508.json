        "content": "Even though the 2020 presidential election has yet to occur, people are already thinking about what would happen if the newly elected president left office.\n\"If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election but cannot serve his full term, vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris would assume the role of president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become vice president,\" reads a popular Facebook post. \"LET THAT SINK IN!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isnt how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? Its not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didnt have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasnt replaced because a process wasnt codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobarts absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldnt become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but thats for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the presence of entities in the image and caption, finding a match between Nancy Pelosi in the image and her mention in the caption. This gives a high confidence score of 10. However, the external check directly contradicts the caption's claim.  It states that the line of succession, in the event of a president's early departure, would place Kamala Harris as President and not Nancy Pelosi as Vice President.  This external fact-check provides strong evidence against the caption's assertion, resulting in a confidence score of 10. The conflict arises because the internal check only verifies the presence of named entities, while the external check assesses the factual accuracy of the entire statement. Because the external validation, which assesses the factual accuracy, is more crucial, we prioritize it,  resulting in a final verdict of 'Out of Context'.  The high confidence scores from both checks reinforce the certainty of this conclusion.  There's no ambiguity or uncertainty; the caption is demonstrably false according to established lines of presidential succession.  The discrepancy is not due to a lack of information or evidence but a fundamental difference in what each check assesses.  The entity alignment check is insufficient to validate the truthfulness of a factual claim; hence, the external check's assessment takes precedence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms entity alignment, while external check refutes the caption's factual claim about presidential succession. The external validation, focused on factual accuracy, outweighs the internal check, leading to a conclusive 'Out of Context' verdict."

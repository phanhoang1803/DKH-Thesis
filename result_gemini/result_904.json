However, the image went into heavy circulation after Sanders drew large crowds during a campaign swing through Sacramento in early May 2016, an event documented by Twitter users:\nNeither the August 2015 nor the May 2016 rally was ignored by the news media, mainstream or otherwise. The August 2015 Los Angeles rally involving an estimated 27,000 people was reported by The Hill, and the May 2016 Sacramento event was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, SFGate, the New York Times, and the Huffington Post (among others):\nVideo of the 9 May 2016 Sacramento rally was also posted to YouTube, bearing the identifying marker of ABC News:",

Although the source notes that the specific date mentioned in the meme (May 2016) was inaccurate, the fact that a large rally did take place in California is confirmed.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal validation check correctly identifies that the caption is mismatched to the image. The image depicts a massive crowd, but there's no visual evidence linking it to a Bernie Sanders rally or California. The internal check's low confidence score (0) reflects this lack of visual evidence. However, the external validation check shows high confidence (8) in supporting the claim of a large Bernie Sanders rally in California, but this information is based on separate evidence, not related to the provided image.  The high confidence of the external check is due to an independent confirmation of a large rally with substantial attendance. The conflict arises because the external check relies on external evidence that is not directly tied to the picture, whereas the internal check is based only on the image content. The external evidence shows a large Bernie Sanders rally in California occurred.  The provided image is of a massive gathering, but lacks any clear identifying elements (banners, signage, etc.) directly connecting it to a Bernie Sanders rally. Because the image itself does not visually support the caption, and the external evidence refers to a separate event than the one depicted in the image, even though an event did happen, we conclude the caption is out of context with regards to the provided image. Therefore, the final judgment is that the caption is out of context (OOC=True). The confidence score is high (9) because both internal and external checks provide strong evidence, albeit on different aspects.  The high confidence reflects the certainty in the individual checks, even though they present conflicting conclusions regarding the image's caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the caption mismatched to the image (confidence 0). External check confirms a large Bernie Sanders rally in California (confidence 8), but this information is independent of the image.  Despite external evidence supporting the event, the image lacks visual cues confirming the claim, resulting in a final assessment that the caption is out of context."

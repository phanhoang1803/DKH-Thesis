        "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump suggested he'd use nuclear weapons against Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a wall.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 March 2016, Politicalo published an article reporting that Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 election, said he would use nuclear weapons on Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a border wall:\nIn a Donald Trump administration, the U.S. military will be so strong that Mexico wont dare to go to war over the wall Trump wants to build between the two countries. On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall? Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isnt playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials emphatic insistence that theyll never cough up the dough.\nBecause nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that, the billionaire businessman added. We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. Thats how I know theyre bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, Im going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when Im done building it, Im going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteens Born In The USA to them, just for the hell of it. You just dont mess with the U.S., and thats that ... Let me tell you, weve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think thats a pretty definitive message, and thats the hard way. Now, Ive said before that political correctness is whats killing this country, and Im standing by it. However, since Ive never been a warmonger, Im trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, well have no problem. If they dont and they start acting up, well, well just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.\nComments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from an MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:\nOn MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\nTrust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn't playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday.\nOne of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials' emphatic insistence that they'll never cough up the dough.\nMexican President Pea Nieto blasted Trump in two separate interviews this week, slamming the billionaire's strident expressions to a Mexico City newspaper and warning that the kind of rhetoric he uses has led to very fateful scenes in the history of humanity.\nThat's the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived, Pea Nieto said. Trump's comments, he told El Universal, have \"hurt the relationship we have sought with the United States.\"\nThe first portion of the article may have led readers to think that the subsequent claims were real, but everything beyond its first paragraph was fabricated. Content published by the self-styled \"hybrid\" news sites Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo built upon controversial current events with related embellishments. Politicalo and related sites featured a button enabling readers to \"Show Facts\" or \"Hide Facts\":\nHowever, every Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo item opened in \"Hide Facts\" mode by default, making the embellishments difficult for readers to identify. In addition to its \"Show Facts/Hide Facts\" feature, Politicalo's disclaimer explained:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nPrevious Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo articles that caused social media confusion included claims that Marco Rubio said women should be taken into custody if they were considering an abortion (and that Zika was a punishment from God), Pat Robertson said gay people should wear colors by which heterosexual people could identify them in public, Pastor John Piper said bikini waxes were a sin in the eyes of God, David Bowie was alive but held hostage by Satanic entities, Ted Cruz said God would not have allowed Antonin Scalia to die at a time that was not politically expedient, a Republican lawmaker proposed saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for food stamp recipients, and Bristol Palin said that more black actors weren't nominated for Oscars because they all looked alike.",

      "explanation": "The Snopes article directly addresses the claim that Trump suggested using nuclear weapons against Mexico if they didn't build a border wall.  Snopes rates this claim as false.  While the article includes a quote where Trump discusses using the US military's strength as leverage,  it explicitly debunks the nuclear threat claim. The article points out that the origin of the claim was from a satirical news site.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows low confidence (confidence_score: 10) because it only assesses whether the caption's entities are present in the image. While the image shows Donald Trump, it doesn't depict the context of the statement mentioned in the caption.  The external check, however, provides strong evidence (confidence_score: 8) that the caption is false. Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks the claim that Trump threatened to use nuclear weapons against Mexico.  Snopes highlights the origin of this claim as a satirical news site, which further undermines its credibility.  The discrepancy arises because the internal check focuses solely on image-caption alignment, while the external check directly verifies the factual accuracy of the caption's core assertion.  Since the external validation involves a credible source directly addressing the claim's truthfulness, it carries more weight.  The high confidence score from the external check, combined with the limited scope of the internal check, leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The assertion regarding nuclear weapons is demonstrably false according to the external source. The image alone offers no confirmation or refutation of this claim. The overwhelming evidence points to the caption being misleading and inaccurate; therefore, it is classified as out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of Donald Trump in the image but cannot verify the statement's context. External check (Snopes) strongly refutes the claim, classifying it as false. The external validation's higher confidence and direct relevance to the caption's core assertion outweigh the limited scope of the internal check.  The caption is deemed out of context."

All manner of rubber-suited nasties shuffled across the screen between 1966 and 1969.\nUsually, they were intent upon breaking into scientific bases accompanied by large amounts of foam. However, one of the Second Doctor's best-loved monsters has to be the Yeti. Rather than directly exploit the myth of the Abominable Snowman, writers Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln opted to make the creatures robotic pawns of nebulous alien being the Great Intelligence.\nLike many good Doctor Who monsters, the Yeti possessed an endearing gimmick - their little control spheres. If the sphere became separated from its host, it would roll across the floor in an attempt to return, all the time making a distinctive whistling sound easily imitated by children throughout the playgrounds of Britain.\nUnsurprisingly, filming for the story didn't take place in or near Tibet. Snowdonia, North Wales, stood in for the Himalayas. Patrick Troughton was no doubt pleased to be snugly wrapped up in an enormous fur coat on location. The coat (and the Yeti) reappeared in Doctor Who's 20th anniversary tale The Five Doctors.\nGuest star for The Abominable Snowmen was Jack Watling, playing explorer Professor Travers. Not only a respected film and television actor, Jack was also Deborah Watling's Dad. The character was deemed popular enough to return, many years older, for swift sequel The Web of Fear. Sadly, Jack passed away in 2001.\nAlso regrettably, only episode two remains in the BBC archives, although a full soundtrack of all six episodes - linked by narration from Fraser Hines - was released by the BBC Radio Collection.",

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check exhibits high confidence (score 10) in the caption's accuracy, stating that the image clearly shows snowmen, perfectly aligning with the caption \"Snowmen\". The external check, while also supporting the caption's accuracy (score 8), introduces an additional layer by referencing \"The Abominable Snowmen\" from Doctor Who. This reference, although about robotic Yetis, doesn't contradict the image's content; it merely expands the semantic possibilities of the term \"Snowmen\".  The external check's lower confidence score (8) might stem from the ambiguity of the term \"Snowmen\" without further contextual information. However, given the image's clear depiction of snow sculptures, the ambiguity is resolved. There is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both agree that the caption is accurate, although the external check acknowledges a potential semantic ambiguity that is easily resolved by the image itself. Considering both checks and their high confidence scores, the overall confidence in the accuracy of the caption is rated as 9 out of 10. There is a strong alignment between the caption and the image content. The minor ambiguity introduced by the external check is insignificant in the face of the clear and direct visual evidence within the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks validate the caption \"Snowmen.\" The internal check is highly confident in the caption's accuracy based on the image content. The external check supports this assessment but highlights a potential semantic ambiguity resolved by the image itself, resulting in a slightly lower confidence score. Overall, there is a strong agreement between the checks, indicating the caption is contextually appropriate."

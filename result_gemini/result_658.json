Brian Kemp and his mother dressed in KKK garb.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nAn image circulated on social media shows a young boy and a woman dressed in Klu Klux Klan (KKK) robes and hoods, with a caption identifying the pictured persons as now-Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and his mother:\nNo evidence suggests this is actually a picture of the Georgia governor or his mother. The photograph is part of the Bettmann Archive, available through the visual media company Getty Images with a caption noting that the identities of the pictured persons are unknown:\nMore important, Getty Images lists the creation date for this photograph as April 27, 1956. As Brian Kemp was born in 1963, it is not temporally possible that he could be the young boy seen here.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies the image as depicting individuals in Ku Klux Klan regalia and acknowledges the caption's claim about Gov. Brian Kemp and his mother but notes the image alone cannot verify this. The external check provides strong evidence contradicting the caption's claim by citing Snopes's fact-check which found no evidence supporting the claim and highlights the chronological impossibility due to the image's age predating Kemp's birth. Both checks are highly confident in their conclusions. The discrepancy lies in whether the image actually depicts Gov. Kemp and his mother.  The external check, using evidence from Snopes, definitively refutes this, and thus outweighs the internal check's less certain assessment.  There is no evidence to support the claim in the original caption. Consequently, the caption is out of context because there's no corroborating evidence to link the individuals in the photo to Gov. Kemp and his mother.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the image shows people in KKK robes. However, they disagree on the identity of the individuals. The external check, citing Snopes, strongly refutes the claim that the image shows Gov. Brian Kemp and his mother. The high confidence score of the external check, combined with the lack of evidence supporting the claim, leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

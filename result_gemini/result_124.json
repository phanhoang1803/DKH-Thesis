He is currently incarcerated in a high-security Mexican prison and is in the process of being extradited to the United States.\nThis article was published on 9 January 2017, and while the author claimed that Assange made the comment at a \"conference\" over the weekend (referring to the 7th and 8th of January), the included photograph was actually taken in February 2016, when the WikiLeaks founder appeared via a video stream for a news conference in which he discussed his possible extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault charge, not improper donations from El Chapo to the Clinton Foundation.\nAs well, Times.com.mx suggested that Assange made his comment in a room full of reporters, yet no legitimate news reports or video clips have surfaced confirming that Assange made any such statment. Furthermore, Times.com.mx did not provide any links to back up their sources or any specific details (such as the time and place of this \"conference\") which could give their report credibility.\nWhile Times.com.mx does not carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction, this story of theirs is clearly just more fake news.",

The image shows Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, but the caption claims he donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, a fact not depicted or verifiable from the image alone.  The internal check's low confidence score (7) reflects this uncertainty. However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score 10) that the claim in the caption is false, citing the claim as \"fake news\". This external evidence decisively refutes the caption's assertion.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score (10) for the external check overrides the lower confidence score of the internal check, leading to a high overall confidence that the caption is out of context. The external check directly addresses and debunks the core assertion of the caption, making the overall assessment highly reliable.",

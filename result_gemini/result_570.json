      "explanation": "The image shows a protest in the streets.  While it's difficult to definitively confirm the location is Niamey, the context of the caption suggests a protest and the presence of individuals engaging in actions consistent with such a scenario. The name Mohamed Bazoum is not visually present in the image. Thus, the image supports some but not all elements of the caption.",

      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The news caption describes a plausible scenario.  Opposition protests following an election result are common. However, without specific details about the election and the extent of the protests, complete verification is impossible.  The claim is plausible given general knowledge of political events but requires further verification from reliable news sources to confirm the details.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 6,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is likely out of context, but neither provides definitive proof. The internal check notes that the image shows a protest, which aligns with the caption's description of \"angry opposition supporters,\" but the specific location (Niamey) and the name Mohamed Bazoum are not verifiable within the image itself.  The external check acknowledges that post-election protests are plausible, lending some credence to the caption, but emphasizes the need for additional evidence to verify the specifics.  Neither check definitively confirms or refutes the caption's details.  The confidence score of 6 reflects this uncertainty. The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty: the internal check suggests a higher degree of support (confidence score of 8) than the external check (confidence score of 8). However, both recognize the need for further verification.  The image depicts a person with a slingshot in a protest-like situation, and this aligns with the general theme of the caption, but the specifics of the caption remain unverified. Therefore, given the limited evidence, it is more prudent to err on the side of caution and classify the caption as potentially out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks suggest the caption may be out of context due to lack of definitive proof linking the image to the specific election and location mentioned in the caption.  While the general scenario of post-election protests aligns with the image content, critical details remain unverified."

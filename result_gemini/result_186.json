There is no evidence of such a raid, and the claim promotes a debunked conspiracy theory.  The overwhelming scientific consensus is that there is no link between vaccines and autism.  Therefore, the caption is implausible.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The caption claiming an FBI raid on the CDC to seize data on a vaccine-autism link is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check, with a confidence score of 0, correctly identifies that the image, showing the exterior of the CDC building, contains no visual evidence of a raid.  The absence of any indication of a raid, such as police presence, emergency vehicles, or visible signs of forced entry, directly contradicts the caption's assertion.  The explanation clearly states the lack of visual support for the claim, making the internal assessment reliable.\n\nThe external check, with a perfect confidence score of 1, provides compelling evidence to refute the caption's factual accuracy.  It correctly points out that the claim is a widely debunked conspiracy theory.  The absence of any credible news reports or official statements confirming such a raid strongly supports the external check's conclusion. The supporting points provided are particularly relevant, citing the overwhelming scientific consensus on the lack of a link between vaccines and autism and the association of this claim with established anti-vaccine misinformation campaigns.  This external validation adds a significant layer of certainty, leaving no room for doubt about the falsity of the caption's statement.\n\nThere is no conflict between the internal and external checks.  Both assessments independently and conclusively demonstrate the caption's inaccuracy. The internal check focuses on the lack of visual evidence within the image, while the external check relies on the verifiable absence of the event described in the caption from reputable news sources and the established scientific consensus.  The convergence of these two validation methods significantly strengthens the overall confidence score.\n\nConsidering the perfect scores in external validation and the zero score in internal validation, the overall confidence in determining the caption as out of context is high (10/10).  There is no uncertainty in the final judgment because the evidence strongly and consistently refutes the claim. The claim is not only unsupported by the image but also contradicts established facts and reliable sources of information. The caption's factual inaccuracy leaves no room for alternative interpretations or ambiguous conclusions.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly and independently confirm that the caption is out of context. The image shows no sign of a raid, and external sources confirm the claim is a false conspiracy theory."

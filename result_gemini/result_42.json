It was the areas first volcanic eruption in nearly 800 years.\nOn Tuesday, Icelands civil protection officials were seen gesturing to dozens of people to move away from lava just meters behind them to ensure visitors do not get hurt. One of the officials said a visitor tried to cook bacon and eggs on the lava  but the pan melted in the heat.\nItalian photographer Vincenzo Mazza, who lives in Iceland, was one of those who got a close look at the slow-flowing lava.\nIve been waiting for many years to see an eruption in Iceland, he said. I saw some eruptions in Italy, like Etna and Stromboli, but this is absolutely different.\nI cant say this is more beautiful than that because they are very different, but this lava glowing just so close to us, its insane, Mazza said.\nThe glow from the lava could be seen from the outskirts of Icelands capital, Reykjavk, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) away.\nIcelandic officials said they did not anticipate evacuations because the volcano is in a remote area, about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the nearest road.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check finds the caption consistent with the image depicting a volcanic eruption in Iceland, with a high confidence score of 10.  The external check corroborates this with a confidence score of 10, citing a news source that explicitly mentions large crowds of visitors flocking to a volcano in southwestern Iceland near Reykjavik following its eruption. The phrase \"Thousands flocked\" in the caption is a reasonable approximation of \"large crowds\" mentioned in the source.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both methods independently confirm that the caption accurately describes the scene shown in the image and reported in the news. The high confidence scores from both checks, combined with the alignment of information, lead to a high overall confidence score of 10 in the caption's accuracy. No further investigation is needed; the evidence comprehensively supports the caption's validity.",

The image shows a volcanic eruption with many people present, and an external news source confirms large crowds visited a volcano near Reykjavik, Iceland, following a recent eruption.  There are no conflicts between the validation methods."

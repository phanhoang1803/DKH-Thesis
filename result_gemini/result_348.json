He shared his feelings and we supported each other and survived a heavy dose of life.\nWe are still checking on each other from a distance, making sure we know each of us is safe from getting too low. Chester's death bonded us. We just spoke yesterday and will forever be close.\nPeace and love to anyone who reads this.\nI can't believe that it has been 2yrs since you left us.

You will forever be in my heart. Until we meet again, R.I.P Chester.\nFor a tad under 18 years you hugged my soul & made me feel safe on my journey through mental health issues. You & the guys literally saved my life, LP is my crisis go to, my home, my comfort, my heart & soul written by a total stranger. I hope your watching over us & can feel the love we all send you. Gone, but never forgotten because legends never truly die, they live on within us   I hope your at peace Chaz, you deserve peace & happiness. From one warrior to another, ThankYou for standing up and speaking truth even amidst the pain. Your a champion my dear Chaz \nWhen I was 8 years old, my sister and I would listen to the radio all day while my mother was working her butt off. Artists like Maroon 5, Usher and JoJo were really popular but I never really cared much for them. It wasn't until \"In The End\" came on that my rock and metal facination began. The influence of his music has not only been nostalgic for me ever since but a way to cope with my own darkness. May Chester rest in peace and his legacy live on not only in the Rock n Roll \"Hall of Fame,\" but within all the hearts of those he touched. My most sincere sympathies to his family and friends.\nI really liked your music you are a really great musician and your music had a lot of meaning behind it and i can tell. I always felt like the music you wrote had a meaning to me and it does especially the song one more light i really like that song a lot. its too bad your gone now :( you will always have a special place in my heart\nYou are that one light that is truly missed. You have made me realize that I am one light that should never go out of my children's lives. You give me the strength to go on. When I first heard one more light I cried and I still cry when I hear it. It made me realize that we are all important and we will be missed.\nChester is a very big inspiration to me. I suffer depression, I'm bipolar in fact and my mania days are terrible. I've put myself in Chester's shoes metaphorically just to try to understand what he was thinking or feeling. My condolences to his band mate, his family and the rest of his fans. I love you Chester and I'd give anything to have you back in the world. Rest in peace Legend \nHere again. And probably again and again and again. I just want to thank you, your music and your voice gives me the same strong like the first time Ive heard them. Not only Linkin Park but even Dead by Sunrise. Just, thank you. I dont still know why I care so much, we had never met, but your energy gives me always a powerful help to quit the black hole. Wherever you are, Rest In Peace Chester.\nMy favorite singer, possibly of all time, where do we even begin? Eight months later your family, friends, band and fans are still mourning in your memory. Your voice and lyrics were the soundtrack to most of our lives and to fathom that we will never hear your voice in a new song again is numbing. Because of your death, a bond has strengthened between all those who love you. Remembering the tragedy of your last day has the eyes and hearts of others opened, ready to help those who are struggling, the way you did. As a result, lives are being saved. If only you were here to be told that. You are significantly missed. You will always be significantly missed. Thank you for everything. Praying always for your family and for those who love and miss you.\nDear Sir/Madam,\nFrom quite some time I wanted to share my condolence to you about your lose but always stopped by the thought of My single letter or words will not make any difference .But today I just cannot resist myself of writing this letter .\nI will not say that I do understand under your pain but yes I do feel a part of your pain and will do anything to make it less if I can be helpful by any I mean. Chester song and his voice means a lot to me .There were time when I thought I cannot take any more, thought of just quitting ,thought of not surviving the past but It was his songs which help me go though and I am happy to share that today I live a healthy and happy life which would be impossible without Chester .\nIf it make you happy that I want to share ,yes Chester save a life and I don't know how many more life he saved because of his cherish nature .I pray to God where ever he is now ,he find his peace\nNayeer Samsi\nThank you for everything, Chester. If it wasn't for your music, I probably wouldn't be here. You've helped me suppress my demons, but couldn't suppress yours. While it's been nearly four months since you left this world, I still think about you often and how I wish I could thank you in person. I pray you've found peace in the next life. Wishing you were here to comfort us more. Your legacy and music will continue to live on forever. Rest In Peace, Chester. Thank you for everything.",

It was very clear that being a dad was more important to him than anything else. Our thoughts are with his family.\nRobin Fontenot, a dog walker in Palos Verdes Estates, visited Benningtons home Thursday afternoon to pay her respects to a resident she described as generous both to his family and the community.\nIts sad. Its really sad, said Fontenot, who ran into Bennington around town at a local gym and shopping center.\nShe said her daughter went to school with Benningtons son at Ridgecrest Intermediate School.\nHe was really involved with his kids from what I understand, she said. He gave back a lot. He really gave back a lot.\nLinkin Parks last concert was July 6 in Birmingham, England. The performance marked the end of a tour that took the band through London and Greenwich, as well as to Belgium, Hungary, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy in June.\nA United States tour is scheduled to begin Thursday at the Xfinity Center in Mansfield, Massachusetts.

        "content": "If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\nOn the afternoon of May 26th, Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington gave a performance unlike any in his career. His close friend, Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, was being laid to rest at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. My name is Chester, Bennington told the mourners gathered there. I had the great privilege of being a friend of Chris and invited to be a member of his family. Then, accompanied by Linkin Park bandmate Brad Delson on guitar, he sang Hallelujah. Bennington had become famous in the early 2000s as the powerhouse voice of one of rocks biggest bands, expressing himself through an angst-ridden scream, but that day his singing was different: plaintive, somber, fragile. He also paid tribute to Cornell on Twitter: Your voice was joy and pain, anger and forgiveness, love and heartache all wrapped up into one. I suppose thats what we all are. You helped me understand that.\nLess than two months later, Bennington, too, was being mourned. He died of suicide by hanging and was found on the morning of July 20th in his Palos Verdes Estates home in Los Angeles County, a week before Linkin Park were to set out on a 29-date North American tour. The singer, 41, had been on vacation in Arizona with his wife, Talinda, and his family, but came home alone, saying he needed to work. (Linkin Park had a photo shoot scheduled for the morning of the 20th.) TMZ reported that police had found a partially empty bottle of alcohol in the bedroom where he had died.\nBennington had always been open about his struggles with addiction and depression, but those close to him were shocked by his suicide. The day after Cornells memorial, Bennington tweeted that he was feeling very creative and had written six new songs. Around the same time, he told a friend, Rene Mata, We have to stick together, and we have so much to live for.\nEditors picks\nBennington had reason to be happy: Linkin Parks new album, One More Light, had topped the charts when it was released in May, and a single, Heavy, was doing well on rock radio. In addition to the Linkin Park tour, he was planning a reunion with his pre-fame grunge band, Grey Daze, for September. He was on top of the world, says Sean Dowdell, drummer for Grey Daze and a friend of Benningtons since their teens, who last talked to him two days before his death.\nSteve Stevens, who plays guitar with Billy Idol, remembers Bennington holding a new puppy while greeting everyone who came backstage at an event last October for Rock to Recovery, an organization for sober musicians. He was making sure that everybody got to meet the dog at the door, he says. It was so endearing and so Chester.\nHe was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, its horrifying  longtime friend Ryan Shuck\nOn Linkin Parks European tour in June and July, Bennington seemed to be in top form. We saw the most alive and present Chester of my 15-and-a-half-year history with the band, says Jim Digby, the groups director of touring. He was arguably in the best physical condition of his life.\nA few days before his death, Bennington had been texting with Robert DeLeo, his bandmate in Stone Temple Pilots (Bennington fronted the band from 2013 to 2015 after Scott Weiland left the group). His messages were loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things, DeLeo recalls. And the day before he died, Bennington e-mailed former Guns N Roses drummer Matt Sorum, saying hed like to perform again with their all-star covers band, Kings of Chaos.\nBut some of Benningtons friends now feel they overlooked signs that the singers dark side  which he called his dark passenger, a reference to the force that motivated the serial-killer protagonist on TVs Dexter  had been creeping back into his life. Bennington had gone to rehab around 2006 and appeared to be sober in the years after. But friends say he suffered a three-day relapse last August, during which he blacked out from alcohol, and had been drinking as recently as October.\nA month before his death, Bennington told longtime friend Ryan Shuck, who played guitar in Benningtons side project Dead by Sunrise, that he was six months sober. But Bennington also sent Shuck, who had his own struggles with alcoholism, some text messages that seemed portentous in hindsight: He was describing an hour-by-hour battle with addiction. When I look at it now, its horrifying. He was telling me, down to the detail, what he would do in the first hour he wanted to drink: I basically just take it hour-by-hour every day. \nBennington talked about his issues in an interview in February with Music Choice. I have a hard time with life, he said while describing the meaning behind the hit Heavy. Even when its good, I just am uncomfortable all the time. . . . The opening line, I dont like my mind right now  like, that is me 24 hours a day. And if I get stuck in here, like, I just find life really hard. It doesnt have to be.\nRelated\nShuck believes Bennington had a couple of drinks just before his death. We dont know how much, but it doesnt take much when youre that advanced an alcoholic and an addict and youre battling to the extent he described to me. You dont need much to lose your mind for a minute.\nShuck and Dowdell downplay speculation that Cornells death inspired Benningtons. While there are similarities  both artists hanged themselves, and Bennington did so on what would have been Cornells 53rd birthday  they believe it was mostly a coincidence. It could be a part of it, but its a small part of it, Shuck says. I think that its just another horrible event that gets put in your subconscious. Its kindling, but the fire was already burning.\nBenningtons troubles go back to a nightmarish childhood. He was born on March 20th, 1976, in Phoenix, the youngest of four children. His mother, Susan, was a nurse; his father, Lee, was a police detective who investigated child-sex crimes. They divorced when Chester was 11, and, feeling abandoned by his mother, he lived with his dad, whom he later said was not emotionally stable at the time.\nFrom the time Chester was seven or eight until he was 13, he was sexually abused by an older male friend. I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didnt want to do, he once said. It destroyed my self-confidence.\nThe experience led Bennington to explore drugs and alcohol. By his teens, he had used opium, amphetamines, marijuana and cocaine. Id drink so much that Id shit my pants, he once said. Bennington claimed to have kicked substance abuse the first time in 1992, when a local gang burst into a place where he was getting high with his friends and beat and robbed them.\nBennington poured his experiences into Linkin Parks songs, which mixed his soul-baring screams with Mike Shinodas rapping and the bands lumbering riffs for a sound that dominated the pop charts for much of the 2000s. He had a distinct voice, at once delicate and ferocious, says actor and 30 Seconds to Mars frontman Jared Leto, who met Bennington on the festival circuit in the 2000s (30 Seconds to Mars also toured with Linkin Park in 2014). Its the angel and the demon, sitting on both shoulders. You could feel the tension between the two when he sang, and I think the reason so many people connected to his music was because of that balance he achieved between the two.\nBenningtons songs, many co-written with Shinoda, became anthems for young people struggling with some of the same emotional issues.  Crawling, for example, is probably the most literal song lyrically Id ever written for Linkin Park, Bennington said of the single, off the bands megaselling 2000 debut, Hybrid Theory. Thats about feeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol.\nThose who knew him say Bennington didnt let his struggles define his personality. He could be funny in a juvenile way one minute (he was a fan of scatological humor) and deeply sensitive the next: Shuck recalls Bennington kicking himself endlessly after making a joke about lung cancer onstage.\nHis messages were loving, positive, looking-forward-to-the-future, growing-old kinds of things, Robert DeLeo recalls.\nBennington would sometimes tell bands that opened for Linkin Park, Next time we might be opening for you guys. Sorum remembers how hed asked the Kings of Chaos band members to do a gig shortly before Christmas. Bennington and DeLeo were laid over for 12 hours in Chicago, and the drummer felt horrible for keeping them from home during the holiday season. I e-mailed those guys and said, I apologize. Im so sorry. Thank you so much for going the distance,  Sorum says. And typical Chester style, he e-mailed back: Anytime, bro. There was no drama. Nothing.\nAt home, Bennington found solace in his six kids. Hed become a father for the first time at age 20, and first got married in 1996. That relationship ended in a tumultuous divorce, marked by a relapse where I drank myself to the point where I couldnt leave the house and I couldnt function, he recalled. I wanted to kill myself. He married Talinda in 2005, and the couple had a son and twin daughters. Leto remembers going to Benningtons house for dinner one night. I walk in and its just jam-packed with the biggest family youve ever seen, he says. I just couldnt believe that he had such a beautiful and thriving family life, especially for someone so young. I hadnt seen so much of that [in him], spending time on the road.\nHe always had enjoyable tales of his six kids, which he always referred to with a beaming smile, no matter what kind of parental woe might have had him do a double take, says ZZ Tops Billy Gibbons, who toured with Bennington in Kings of Chaos within the past year. His tattoo-parlor business was another highlight; he had me designing silver jewelry for the Las Vegas shop where we whiled away the hours talking shop. He was really an engaging soul.\nIn late July, Shuck paid tribute to Bennington at a private service in Los Angeles, where he read a eulogy alongside Linkin Parks Joe Hahn and Shinoda. (The members of Linkin Park, as well as Talinda Bennington, declined to be interviewed for this story.)\nBenningtons death is still resonating among his fans, who experienced a shock wave when the news reached the public. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline says it received a 14 percent spike in calls on the day after the news broke.\nTen days after Benningtons death, the singers home was encircled with a temporary six-foot fence. A police cruiser sat outside as fans left flowers, drawings, signs, guitar picks and crosses on its perimeter. When I found out, I was at a museum, and I just bawled my eyes out, said 19-year-old Briana Yah-Diaz. It was like a piece of my childhood went away. The little-girl part of me needs to come up and pay my respects. . . . I could always count on them.\nOutside his home, one note read, Fly free now! With love all the way from Texas. Another said, Dear Chester Bennington, It hurts all of us to know that you saved so many lives, yet we couldnt save you. . . .\nAdditional reporting by Steve Appleford\nAll donations to Music For Relief will now be directed to the One More Light Fund in honor of Bennington",

Multiple reliable sources clearly state that Bennington's death was a suicide by hanging. The external check's low confidence score (3) reflects the uncertainty about the 'similarity' claim because no evidence supports it.  The conflict lies in the internal check's overconfidence in a partially accurate caption. The external check's findings significantly outweigh the internal check's limited accuracy because the claim of murder is a central and demonstrably false element. Considering the substantial discrepancy and the external validation's strong refutation of the murder claim, we arrive at a low confidence score of 3. The caption is out of context because it falsely presents Bennington's death as a murder, a claim unsupported by evidence.",

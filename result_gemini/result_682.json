(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds the caption inaccurate because Lake Michigan does not have icebergs, while the external check provides concrete evidence that the image's icebergs are from a location thousands of miles away from Lake Michigan. The high confidence scores from both checks (0 for internal and 8 for external) converge on the conclusion that the caption is factually incorrect.  The external check's evidence, which directly addresses the false attribution of the image to Lake Michigan, outweighs the absence of a numerical score in the internal check's confidence level. The internal check's qualitative assessment perfectly aligns with the external check's findings. The external check uses a reliable source to show that the image's icebergs were falsely associated with Lake Michigan, thereby solidifying the OOC judgment. There is a clear consensus that the picture shows icebergs that are not located in Lake Michigan.  The high degree of agreement between the internal and external checks contributes to the high confidence score of 9.  There is no uncertainty regarding the mismatch between the caption and the image's content based on the solid evidence provided.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks conclusively show the caption is out of context. The image depicts icebergs, which are not found in Lake Michigan, and external sources confirm the image's misattribution."

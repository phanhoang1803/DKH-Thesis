      "explanation": "Kayamandi is a township near Stellenbosch, South Africa.  People walking on streets is a commonplace activity. Therefore, the statement 'A person walking on streets of Kayamandi' is factually plausible.  However, without further context or verification, the confidence score is not higher as it's a very generic statement.",

  "final_result": {

    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both support the caption's claim that the image depicts a person walking on a street. While neither check definitively confirms the location as Kayamandi, both acknowledge the plausibility of the statement.  The internal check highlights the scene's consistency with the caption's description, noting the presence of a person walking and street-like features. It correctly points out the lack of explicit location labeling. The external check reinforces this by establishing Kayamandi as a real place where street activity is commonplace. Both checks appropriately assign a confidence score of 8, reflecting the lack of conclusive evidence yet acknowledging the inherent plausibility.  There are no major discrepancies or conflicting information between the two checks. Both agree that the caption is factually plausible but lacks complete confirmation. Because there is no evidence to suggest the caption is inaccurate and both scores reflect a high degree of likelihood, the OOC is set to 'false'. The final confidence score remains at 8, reflecting the overall agreement and the remaining uncertainty about the exact location.  The lack of direct location labeling in the image and the generic nature of the statement (\"a person walking on streets\") prevents a higher confidence score.  A higher confidence would require explicit confirmation of the location in either the image itself or external image metadata.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks find the caption plausible but lack definitive proof of the location.  The scene aligns with the caption's description, and Kayamandi is a real place with streets.  The confidence score remains at 8, reflecting the uncertainty related to the location."

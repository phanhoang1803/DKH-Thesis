      "explanation": "The statement is plausible given the history of political unrest and human rights concerns in Nicaragua.  Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica protesting government actions and holding photos of victims would be consistent with similar events in other countries experiencing political instability. However, without specific details about the timing and the events depicted in the photos, it's impossible to definitively verify the claim. The confidence score is moderate due to the lack of specific verifiable details.",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10, strongly supporting the caption's accuracy. The explanation states that the image clearly shows Nicaraguans in Costa Rica holding pictures of people killed or imprisoned, aligning perfectly with the caption. The external check provides a moderate confidence score of 7. While acknowledging the plausibility of the caption given Nicaragua's political climate and the common practice of protests involving photos of victims, it points out the lack of specific details to definitively verify the claim.  The external check mentions the possibility of Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica protesting government actions, which is consistent with the image's content.  The discrepancy between the confidence scores arises from the difference in the level of detail considered. The internal check focuses solely on the image content, while the external check considers broader context and the need for more information to confirm the event's precise details.  There is no conflict between the checks; they both agree on the core assertionâ€”the image depicts Nicaraguans in Costa Rica holding photos of victims. However, the external check rightly points out that more information is needed for absolute certainty.  Given that the image itself strongly supports the caption, and the external concerns are mainly about lack of precise details rather than contradicting information, the final confidence score is 8, reflecting a high degree of certainty with a minor caveat about the lack of specific details regarding the event. The validation summary confirms the alignment between image content and caption, acknowledging the external check's concerns about the need for more contextual information. Both the internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, despite a slight difference in their confidence levels, leading to a final conclusion that the caption is not out of context. The minor reduction in the confidence score is a cautious approach to acknowledge the lack of complete context information, which doesn't negate the image content but adds a layer of uncertainty about the precise event depicted. Overall, the assessment reflects a conservative judgment based on available evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, although the external check highlights the need for more contextual details for complete verification. The image strongly aligns with the caption's description, leading to a high confidence score but with a minor caveat."

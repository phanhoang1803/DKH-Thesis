There is no visual evidence of Obama in the image, and the image does not show anything to suggest a change in the national animal. Therefore, only the presence of a bison is confirmed visually.",

Despite the clickbait claim, the text of this article made no such argument:\nAccording to recent reports, our nation is about to get a new animaland its quite a departure from the bald eagle, which has been the sole symbol of the United States for 234 years.\nReports indicate that the National Bison Legacy Act has just been passed by Congress, and is expected to pass through the Senate next week. The act denotes the bison as Americas national mammal and a historical symbol of the United States.\nThe eagle will reportedly still represent the nation, but it will no longer be the sole animal doing so. If passed, the bison will join the bald eagle, the oak, and the rose as a symbol for our country.\nDespite the title, the actual story was primarily based on factual information. The National Bison Legacy Act, which designated the bison as the national mammal of the United States, was passed by Congress at the end of April 2016. But while this legislation will give the United States its first national mammal, it will have no effect on the bald eagle's status as the United States' national bird, nor as its national symbol.",

The provided evidence from Snopes explicitly debunks this claim. While the National Bison Legacy Act designated the bison as the national mammal, it did not replace the bald eagle as the national bird or symbol. The Snopes article highlights that the initial reports were misleading clickbait.",

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation processes strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 7, correctly identifies the presence of a bison in the image but notes the caption's claim about President Obama and a change in the national animal is not visually supported.  The image itself provides no evidence of any political action or change in national symbols. The discrepancy lies in the caption introducing elements entirely unrelated to the visual content.  The external check, with a significantly higher confidence score of 10, decisively refutes the caption's central claim.  It uses a reliable source (Snopes) to demonstrate that the assertion about President Obama replacing the bald eagle with the bison as the national animal is false. This external validation provides strong evidence that the caption is not only inconsistent with the image but also factually inaccurate. There is complete agreement between the internal and external checks in concluding the caption is out of context; the external check provides further evidence of the factual inaccuracy of the statement.  The high confidence score of 10 reflects the robust evidence from the external validation, confirming the caption's falsity and its detachment from the image.  No ambiguity or uncertainty remains after considering both checks, leading to a definitive conclusion of the caption being entirely out of context. In summary, the image depicts a bison, which aligns with part of the caption, but the claim about political action and the change of the national animal is entirely fabricated and unsupported by any visual or factual evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation confirm the caption is out of context. The internal check flags the mismatch between the image and the caption's political narrative. The external check definitively refutes the factual claim using a credible source, achieving a high confidence score."

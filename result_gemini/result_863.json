According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\nRobs a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com  where the story originated  clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press theyve had no such complaints made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

Both sources, Snopes and AP News, explicitly state that the story of a man losing his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke is false.  Source 1 (Snopes) identifies the story's origin as a hoax article published by IsThatLegit.com and later copied by other websites. Source 2 (AP News) reports that police in both Calgary and Boston found no record of such an incident.

    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The internal check, with a confidence score of 10, points out a clear mismatch between the image (showing a damaged scuba tank and an emergency scene) and the caption's claim about a man losing his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke.  The image provides no visual evidence to support the caption's narrative.  The external check, with a confidence score of 8, corroborates this assessment by citing fact-checks from Snopes and AP News. These sources explicitly label the story as a hoax, indicating that the event described in the caption never occurred.  There's a consensus between the internal and external checks that the information in the caption is false and not supported by evidence.  The fact-checking sources further highlight that the hoax originated from IsThatLegit.com, which published a fabricated report, and was subsequently spread on social media platforms. Police investigations mentioned by AP News also concluded no such event occurred. Therefore, based on the strong and consistent evidence, it can be reliably stated with high confidence that the caption is entirely out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly confirm that the caption is out of context. The internal analysis finds no visual evidence supporting the caption, while external fact-checks identify the story as a hoax."

(Despite the dramatic image, only minor injuries were reported.)",

Snopes directly refutes the claim that Marla Maples died in a plane crash in April 2017, citing it as fake news that used an unrelated image from a 1997 plane crash.  The Snopes article explicitly states that the claim is false and explains that the image used to support the false claim was from a 1997 incident.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check has a confidence score of 0 and correctly identifies that the image depicts Marla Maples, but the caption falsely claims she died in a plane crash in April 2017.  This is further corroborated by the external check which provides a confidence score of 10, citing Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website. Snopes explicitly debunks this claim, confirming that Marla Maples is still alive and that the claim originated from fake news sources which misused an unrelated image from a 1997 plane crash.  There is no conflict between the internal and external assessments; both point to the caption being factually incorrect and out of context. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong evidence from both the internal analysis and the external verification through Snopes.  The image is clearly of Marla Maples, and widely available information confirms she is alive, directly contradicting the caption's assertion.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in this case. The evidence consistently shows that the caption is entirely false and unrelated to the image.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly support that the caption is out of context. The internal analysis identifies the image subject correctly but refutes the caption's false death claim.  External verification using Snopes provides definitive proof of the claim's falsity."

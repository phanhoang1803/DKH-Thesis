However, the claim that smelling the perfume causes death is entirely unsupported by the image. The external check decisively refutes the caption's claim. Perfumes are not inherently lethal; the statement lacks scientific basis and is likely a hoax.  Both checks agree that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score reflects the strong agreement and the implausibility of the caption's claim. There is no conflict between internal and external checks; both independently support the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",

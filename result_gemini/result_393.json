      "explanation": "The image shows an orangutan washing something in a blue basin.  While the name Sandra is not visible, the action depicted aligns with the caption's description of an orangutan washing its hands. The reference to COVID-19 is not directly visible but is plausible given the context.",

    "result": {
      "confidence_score": 8,
      "explanation": "The news caption is plausible. Orangutans are intelligent primates capable of learning behaviors through observation.  The COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, making the timeframe feasible. Handwashing became a prominent practice during that time, increasing the likelihood of an orangutan observing and potentially imitating the behavior. However,  the claim requires verification from reliable sources to confirm that the video depicts Sandra and the specific circumstances described.",
      "supporting_points": "Orangutans are intelligent primates; COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020; handwashing increased in 2020 due to pandemic; animals can learn through observation and imitation.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the alignment between the image and the caption's description of an orangutan washing something in a basin. The reference to COVID-19 and the name \"Sandra\" are not directly visible in the image, but the action is consistent with the caption's narrative.  The external check also shows a high confidence score (8), supporting the plausibility of the caption. The external check acknowledges the need for verification from reliable sources to confirm the specific details, such as the orangutan's name and the precise circumstances. However, it provides strong supporting points: orangutans are known for their intelligence and observational learning abilities; the COVID-19 pandemic did occur in early 2020; increased handwashing was indeed a prominent public health measure during that time; and animals can learn by imitating human behaviors.  There is no significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both validate the core message of the caption—an orangutan performing a handwashing-like action—while acknowledging the need for further confirmation regarding specifics like the orangutan's name and the direct link to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The high confidence scores from both checks, along with the supporting evidence, lead to the conclusion that the caption is not out of context. The slight deduction in the overall confidence score (from 10 to 9) reflects the need for additional verification to fully confirm all aspects of the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks show high confidence in the core message of the caption. The external check highlights the need for further verification of specific details, leading to a slightly reduced overall confidence score."

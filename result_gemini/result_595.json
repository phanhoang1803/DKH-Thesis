On 24 March 2019, for instance, this photograph was shared as if it showed a 9-year-old girl who had been impregnated by a Muslim man:\nThis image does not show a pregnant child. This photograph was originally posted by the Garrafo do Norte Facebook page in November 2016 and shows a 12-year-old girl named Sandy at a hospital in Belm, Brazil. At the time, the Facebook page was attempting to raise money for her medical care, as she was suffering from problems with her liver:\nThe Brazilian website Diario Online reported that Sandy had struggled with an enlarged liver and spleen since she was six months old. Her aunt, Maria Zeneide, told the outlet: \"(Sandy) has been fighting the disease since six months after a bacterium that settled and infected everything. She was being treated in Porto Alegre, but due to her mother's health problems, the two had to go home and the treatment had to be stopped.\"",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original caption claiming the image depicts a 9-year-old girl impregnated by a Muslim man is demonstrably false based on both internal and external validation.  The internal check, with a confidence score of 0, accurately notes that the image shows a young girl with significant abdominal distension, a condition that could be attributed to various medical reasons.  Crucially, the image provides no evidence whatsoever to support the claim of pregnancy or the involvement of any individual of a specific religious background.  The internal check's assessment aligns perfectly with the external check, which achieves a maximum confidence score of 10.  This high confidence stems from the corroborating evidence provided by a reputable fact-checking source, Snopes.  Snopes definitively labels the claim as \"Miscaptioned\", offering a detailed explanation for why the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  Specifically, Snopes cites that the girl in the photograph has an enlarged liver and spleen, a medical condition entirely unrelated to pregnancy.  The source not only clarifies the actual medical context of the photo but also highlights the attempts to spread disinformation using this image and connect it falsely to a specific religious group (Islamophobia). The Snopes fact-check is further reinforced by providing information on the origin of the photograph and the girl's actual medical history.  This corroboration significantly enhances the reliability and confidence score of the external validation.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both independently and conclusively confirm that the caption is completely out of context. The alignment is perfect, further supporting a strong confidence level in the final conclusion. The claim is not merely inaccurate, it is also deeply damaging, promoting a false narrative that could fuel prejudice and discrimination against a particular religious community.  In conclusion, the overwhelming evidence from both internal analysis of the image and the robust external verification by Snopes unequivocally demonstrates that the original caption is completely fabricated and out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly agree that the original caption is false.  The image shows a child with a medical condition, not a pregnant girl.  Snopes fact-check provides conclusive evidence and contextual background information supporting the miscaptioned nature of the claim."

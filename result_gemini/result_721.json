        "content": "The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring ejaculation is murder and they want strict laws against the practice.\nLife begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control, said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. God made mens semen for a purpose, and you can just waste that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!\nStratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick p*rnos on P*rnHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!",

    "explanation": "The original caption claims that anti-abortion groups claim every sperm cell is a life.  Both the internal and external checks support this claim. The internal check notes that the image depicts protestors holding signs with anti-abortion messages, one of which states \"Ejaculation is murder.\" This directly aligns with the idea that some anti-abortion groups consider sperm cells to be life, thus supporting the caption's assertion.  The external check cites a direct quote from a pro-life activist stating, \"Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!\"  This quote strongly corroborates the caption's claim, although it also acknowledges that not all anti-abortion groups share this specific view.  The high confidence scores from both checks (internal: 10, external: 8) strongly suggest that the caption accurately reflects the beliefs of at least some within the anti-abortion movement. The alignment between the visual evidence (protest signs) and the textual evidence (activist quote) further reinforces the accuracy of the caption. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both support the original caption. While the external check acknowledges that not all anti-abortion groups share this view, the existence of such a view within the movement is undeniable and is accurately captured by the original caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the original caption.  The image shows signs conveying the message that ejaculation is murder, directly supporting the claim.  An external source provides a quote from a pro-life activist echoing this view.  There is strong agreement between both checks, leading to a high confidence score."

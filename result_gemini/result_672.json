      "explanation": "While there's no definitive public record confirming an \"extramarital affair\",  reports from reputable sources indicate a long-term relationship between Harris and Willie Brown during a period when he was married and she was not. The exact nature of their relationship is a matter of interpretation and has been described differently by different people, and so a label of \"extramarital affair\" is only one interpretation and the other details are not fully verifiable.  Therefore, the statement is partially true but could be misleading depending on the intended meaning of \"extramarital affair.\"",

    "explanation": "The internal check found the caption to be completely out of context based on the provided image. The image shows Kamala Harris waving, with no indication of any relationship with Willie Brown. The internal check has a confidence score of 0, indicating no support for the caption within the image. The external check acknowledges reports of a relationship between Harris and Brown, but it also points out the ambiguity surrounding the exact nature of their relationship.  The external check has a confidence score of 8, and although it acknowledges a relationship, it does not confirm an \"extramarital affair.\" The ambiguity surrounding the nature of the relationship, combined with the complete lack of evidence in the image, leads to a final verdict of \"out of context.\" While the external check provides some support for a past relationship between Harris and Brown, this is irrelevant to the image. The image itself does not depict any such relationship.  The external check's higher confidence score reflects the existence of external reporting on the relationship, but the image provides no context for that.  The key discrepancy lies in the fact that the image offers no visual evidence that supports the claim of an \"extramarital affair.\" Even with external evidence acknowledging a past relationship, this does not justify the caption’s claim.  Therefore, the caption is out of context in relation to the image, and the low confidence score reflects this lack of relevant visual evidence in the image. The absence of any visual evidence directly linking the image to the caption's claim is the primary reason for concluding that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check: Caption completely out of context (confidence 0). External check: Reports suggest a past relationship, but the exact nature is unclear and the caption's claim remains unsubstantiated (confidence 8). Discrepancy: Image provides no visual support for the caption's claim. Final Verdict: Caption is out of context."

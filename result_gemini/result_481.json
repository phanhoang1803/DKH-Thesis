        "content": "Claim:\nUlta Beauty will close its doors following a buyout by competitor Sephora.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn April 2017, social media rumors circulated that makeup and beauty chain Ulta Beauty was closing all stores following a buyout by competitor Sephora:\nMany versions contained what appeared to be a link to an article about the sudden closures, (which sometimes appeared to be published by Curbed.com):\nHowever, all links led to a page that was mocked up to look like a phony article from People magazine (hosted at \"people.com-realsource.co\"), with a claim that Sephora's supposed buyout of Ulta would be beneficial for cosmetics shoppers:\nSephora Just Announced They Are Buying Out Ulta - Here's How YOU Can Take Advantage\nSephora just announced that they will acquire the 950 Ulta Stores nationwide, the first major announcement regarding the buy out in the new year. The mega-retailer will double in size and has already begun the liquidation process of Ulta products. To date, 18 of the 950 Ulta stores have already closed. The remaining stores will close by the end of the year.\nSome of you may be sad to see your local Ulta Beauty close down, but the rest of you are probably wondering:\"Will this benefit me in any way?\" The answer to that question is absolutely \"YES!\" On top of the final blowout sales that are going to be held at each of the closing locations, Ulta Beauty cosmetics department is offering FREE SAMPLES of their skin care products..\nThe scam advertisement then claimed that Ulta carries a secret product reserved only for celebrities and other high rollers, but now accessible to all due to the (nonexistent) liquidation of their products thanks to the (nonexistent) buyout:\nUntil recently, Ulta Beauty has always kept an amazing wrinkle secret called Vlamorous Cream reserved for their high paying celebrity clients. They reported that in order to clear the products off the shelves, they needed to give out free samples for everyone to try. As a result, a few weeks ago they shared the simple solution previously only shared with celeb clients to everyone!\nVisitors to the fake People site were greeted by a landing page that resembles the magazine's digital counterpart, complete with invitations to subscribe and a portal to other magazine titles. Clicking the links to other magazines leads to more scam sales pages:\nAttempts to close the page causes a window to pop up with information about a \"free trial\" with dwindling supplies. The page is not published by People, it does not report real news, and it serves only to convert traffic into sales for a skincare product it falsely claims was a long-kept secret at Ulta.",

    "explanation": "The internal check focuses on the image content and caption alignment, finding a match for \"Ulta Beauty\" but noting the absence of information about a Sephora buyout or store closure.  It correctly identifies the presence of Ulta Beauty in the image, giving a high confidence score (10) to this observation. However, it doesn't independently verify the factual accuracy of the claim about the buyout and closure.  The external check, on the other hand, directly addresses the veracity of the caption's core claim.  It definitively labels the claim as false and points to evidence showing it was a hoax.  The external validation's high confidence score (10) underscores its robust verification process.  The conflict arises because the internal check assesses only image-caption alignment, while the external check assesses the truthfulness of the caption's statement.  The external check's result is more important since it directly addresses the factual correctness of the caption's claim. The internal check only confirms the presence of the entity \"Ulta Beauty\" in the image, which is not a validation of the entire caption's statement. Because the external check provides compelling evidence that the caption is factually inaccurate,  we conclude that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10/10) support this conclusion. The image simply shows an Ulta Beauty store; it does not depict or imply any buyout by Sephora or the store's impending closure. Therefore, the caption is misleading and does not accurately represent the context of the image.",

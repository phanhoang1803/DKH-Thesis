Hodas posted the video to Instagram (with tags such as #3D, #photoshop, #render, and #animation), and provided extra insight into how the video was created in response to a query on Facebook:\npretty much! depends on what I need. In this case I layered few planes with wm maps on top of each other and added a lot of zdepth fog to blend it in.\nNo records of volcanos emitting bright pink smoke exist, except those created by digital artists.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption, \"A video shows a pink volcano erupting in New Zealand,\" is out of context. The internal check finds the caption inaccurate because the image depicts pink and purple smoke, not a volcanic eruption.  The confidence score of 0 reflects the clear mismatch between the caption and the image content. The entities 'pink volcano' and 'New Zealand' are not supported by the image's visual content.  The internal check's verdict is False, indicating a lack of alignment between the caption and the image.  The external check provides compelling evidence from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, which debunks the claim of a pink volcano eruption in New Zealand. Snopes confirms that the video of pink smoke circulating online is digitally manipulated and not a genuine volcanic event.  The high confidence score of 10 for the external check stems from Snopes's detailed explanation and the lack of any credible evidence supporting a pink volcanic eruption.  The external check also notes the absence of any documented instances of volcanoes producing bright pink smoke, barring digitally altered content.  There's complete agreement between the internal and external checks: both conclude that the caption is false and the claim is unsubstantiated. The strong consensus between the two checks, supported by concrete evidence from a reputable source, leads to a high confidence score of 10 for the final verdict.  No discrepancies or conflicts exist between the internal and external validations.  Entity analysis further supports the conclusion; there's no visual evidence of a volcano or volcanic activity, only artificially colored smoke.  The image provides no geographical context that can be verified as New Zealand. The external validation decisively supports the internal analysis by providing credible sources to back up the claim that the purported pink volcano eruption is fake. Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context, with high confidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly confirm that the caption is inaccurate. The image shows colored smoke, not a volcanic eruption. External verification from Snopes debunks the claim of a pink volcano in New Zealand, confirming the video is digitally manipulated."

      "explanation": "The news caption describes a plausible scenario: law enforcement receiving a warning about a potential attack. However, without further information such as the source's reliability and evidence supporting the claim, it's impossible to verify the claim's veracity.  FBI involvement in local-level warnings isn't unheard of, but the specificity of a propane bomb attack around Christmas warrants caution. The lack of verifiable details lowers confidence.",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch between the image content (a large explosion) and the caption's description (an FBI agent warning about a planned propane bomb attack). The internal check has a confidence score of 0 because there is no overlap between the image and the caption. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the caption's scenario but emphasizes the lack of verifiable evidence to confirm its truthfulness.  The external check's confidence score is 4, reflecting the uncertainty due to missing details.  Both checks agree that the caption is out of context, with low confidence scores reflecting the lack of supporting evidence.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both point towards the caption being unrelated to the image. The low confidence score reflects the limited information available to assess the caption's accuracy and relevance to the image.  In short, the image depicts an explosion, while the caption describes a warning about a planned bomb attack. There is no visual evidence in the image to support the caption's claims of an FBI agent or the specific details of the warning.  The external check acknowledges that such warnings are possible but underscores the need for corroborating evidence to assess the veracity of this particular claim.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is out of context with the provided image.  Low confidence scores reflect the lack of corroborating evidence."

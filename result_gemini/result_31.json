        "content": "Maine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ?? and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly shows a purple lobster, aligning with the caption's mention of a rare purple lobster. However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score of 2) that contradicts this.  The external check cites a source that explicitly states the image was digitally manipulated and shared as a joke, not a genuine catch. This source also points out that while a purple lobster is possible, there's no verifiable evidence supporting the claim of a Maine lobsterman catching one. The discrepancy arises from a conflict between the visual evidence (internal check) and the factual evidence (external check). The external evidence of digital manipulation significantly undermines the internal check's visual observation. Although the image shows a purple lobster, the external evidence definitively proves the image is fake, making the caption's implication of a genuine catch inaccurate. Weighing the evidence, the high confidence in the external check's debunking of the image's authenticity overrides the internal check's assessment.  Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because the presented image is not of a genuinely caught lobster; it is a digitally altered image. The external verification is stronger, despite the internal check giving a higher score, because it provides factual evidence against the image's validity, which the internal check does not have the capability of providing.  No additional entity analysis is necessary, as the conflict is resolved through considering the definitive nature of the external evidence, which is supported by the digital manipulation evidence.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms the presence of a purple lobster, but the external check reveals the image is digitally manipulated. External evidence decisively refutes the claim, resulting in a conclusion that the caption is out of context."

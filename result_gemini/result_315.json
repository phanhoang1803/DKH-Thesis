    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal check found no visual evidence in the provided image to support the claim that President Trump is mocking the deaths of George Floyd or Eric Garner. The image simply shows him speaking at a rally.  The internal check has a confidence score of 0 because the image content directly contradicts the caption's assertion. The external check acknowledges that while no widely circulated videos definitively prove the caption's claim, President Trump's past statements regarding these events have faced criticism for being insensitive or dismissive.  The external check has a confidence score of 8 due to the existence of documented instances of such controversial statements, though without direct visual proof from a widely accessible video.  The discrepancy lies in the evidence type: the internal check relies on visual information from a single image, while the external check considers broader contextual information and public statements.  Given the lack of direct visual evidence from a reputable source showing the specific actions described in the caption (Trump mimicking choking and saying \"I can't breathe\"), and considering the significant difference in confidence scores, we prioritize the internal check's definitive refutation of the specific claim made in the caption. The external check highlights the context of past controversial statements, but doesn't support the visual description in the caption, therefore the caption is out of context. The overall confidence score is 8 because of the external validation of some related events, despite the absence of direct visual confirmation for the particular event the caption describes.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check definitively refutes the caption's claim based on the image content. External check acknowledges some related controversial statements by President Trump but lacks direct video evidence to confirm the caption's specific description of his actions.  Therefore, both checks indicate that the caption is out of context."

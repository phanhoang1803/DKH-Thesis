        "content": "A YouTube star's video about his removal from a Delta Air Lines flight has gone viral across social media.\nAdam Saleh told the BBC he was asked to get off the London-New York flight on Wednesday after speaking to his mother in Arabic on the phone.\nHe said a fellow passenger had expressed feeling uncomfortable.\nBut in a statement, external, Delta Air Lines said that Mr Saleh and another customer had been removed because of disruptive and provocative behaviour.\nThe incident is said to have taken place while the plane was still at Heathrow airport, and also involved Mr Saleh's friend.\nMr Saleh said: \"This lady screamed, 'what is he saying?' and said she felt uncomfortable.\n\"The captain came and asked what happened.\n\"I was so disgusted I took a video, external as I was being asked to leave,\" he added.\nHowever, the US airline said that it had collected multiple statements from crew members and passengers and concluded that the \"customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behaviour, including shouting\".\n\"This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight,\" the statement said.\nIt continued: \"While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.\"\nMr Saleh said he later boarded a different flight with a different company.\n\"Once we were off the [Delta Air Lines] plane, we were told it was because we were being loud. You don't just kick someone off for being loud!\" said Mr Saleh.\nMr Saleh's friend, Slim Albaher, who was also escorted off the plane, said: \"I just froze. It was like something you'd only see in the movies.\"\nMr Saleh is well-known for carrying out pranks, which he posts on YouTube.\nEarlier this month, he claimed to have hidden in a suitcase, external and travelled from Melbourne to Sydney in the hold. It was later exposed as a hoax.\nMr Saleh has also filmed a number of experiments to see how plane passengers respond to flying alongside Muslims.\nNumerous Arabic speakers have reported being questioned, or made to leave planes, and felt it was because of their race or assumptions about their religion.\nLondon pastor Olaolu Opebiyi was removed from an easyJet plane in March, after a passenger spotted a \"prayer on his phone\" and reported him as a security threat.\nAn Iraqi university student in California said he was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight in the US after having a conversation in Arabic in April.\nFaizah Shaheen, a Muslim from Leeds, was detained by UK airport police under terror laws in August, after she was spotted reading a book on Syrian culture during her honeymoon flight.",

      "explanation": "The news caption accurately reflects Adam Saleh's account of being removed from a Delta flight.  While Delta's statement attributes the removal to disruptive behavior, Saleh's account explicitly mentions speaking Arabic on the phone as a triggering factor leading to a passenger's discomfort and subsequent removal from the flight. The evidence presents both sides of the story, but Saleh's version directly supports the claim in the news caption.",

    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges the image only shows Adam Saleh on a plane, not the incident itself.  It correctly points out the caption's claim about the reason for his ejection (speaking Arabic) is not visually verifiable in the provided image.  The confidence score is 10 because the image does show the named entity (Adam Saleh) in the context of a plane, aligning with part of the caption.  The external check provides substantial evidence supporting the claim. Multiple news sources reported on the event, corroborating Adam Saleh's statement about speaking Arabic as a contributing factor to his removal from the flight.  While Delta's official statement emphasized disruptive behavior, Saleh's account, backed by news reports, explains the Arabic conversation as a preceding event leading to the passenger's complaint and subsequent removal.  The external check's confidence score is 8 because it acknowledges the existence of conflicting accounts (Saleh's vs. Delta's), yet Saleh's version directly supports the caption's assertion. Since the external evidence strongly supports the caption's claim, even though the image lacks visual proof of the specific event, the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy is high (9). There's no significant conflict between the internal and external checks.  The internal check highlights the image's limitations; the external check fills that gap with corroborating evidence from news reports.  The final assessment considers the confluence of evidence: the image confirms the presence of the named entity in a relevant context, and external sources independently validate the core claim of the caption.  The caption is not entirely out of context but lacks full visual confirmation of the ejection and specific reason; however, the external evidence provides strong support.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check verifies entity alignment (Adam Saleh on a plane) but cannot visually confirm the ejection or reason. External check strongly supports the caption's claim using multiple news sources, corroborating Saleh's account.  Despite image limitations, external evidence makes the caption highly likely to be accurate."

        "content": "Claim:\nA video shows police officers attempting to arrest an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\nAs protests erupted across the United States in May 2020 after the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers, the internet was flooded with videos and photographs showing the sometimes chaotic scene.\nWhile much of this media gave genuine glimpses of these protests, a number of miscaptioned pieces of footage also made their way into the mix. The following video, for instance, was viewed millions of times as it circulated along with the claim that it showed two officers in Minnesota attempting to arrest a black man only to find out that he was an FBI agent:\nThis video, however, does not show the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. On the contrary, this video reportedly shows a police \"encounter with [a] black male\" in Rochester, Minnesota, and is unrelated to the protests in 2020.\nThis video was originally posted to Instagram by @thisisnike1 on May 31:\nIts timing coincided with the Floyd protests, but the original post included a caption explaining that this incident had been filmed \"over a year\" ago and that it involved the Rochester Minnesota Police Department. The original caption made no mention of the person in this video being an FBI agent. A version posted to YouTube by this account identified the person simply as a \"black male\":\nSomethin been telling me to hold on to this video over a year now, ok. Some days we make it home or some days we make it 6 feet deep. Imagine getting killed at home, while jogging, playing, minding your own business or just damn breathing #BeingBlackInWhiteAmerica!! This incident happened a year ago. The Minnesota police department been corrupt. Cant even smoke a damn cigarette in peace.\nSoon after this video was posted, it was re-captioned and shared along with the claim that it showed the attempted arrest of an FBI agent. It's unclear where this rumor originated. The above-displayed video makes no mention of this person being an FBI agent and when his wallet is pulled out by the police officer it does not show an FBI badge.\nThis rumor may have started with @thisisnike1, the account that originally posted the video. A screenshot supposedly showing a deleted tweet shows a message from @thisisnike1 reading \"[he is an] FBI agent.\" This appears to have been a joke, however, as this account has retweeted a number of people explaining that this person was not actually an FBI agent:\nIn sum, this video was originally shared with a caption stating that this incident took place over a year earlier (i.e., in 2019, not 2020) and that it featured an encounter between police and an unidentified black male. There's nothing in the video or the original caption indicating that this person was an FBI agent.\nWe reached out to @thisisnike1 and will update this article if more information becomes available.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal check finds no evidence in the image to support the claim that the video shows police arresting an FBI agent during the George Floyd protests.  The confidence score of 3 reflects the lack of supporting information within the image itself. The external check provides strong evidence from a source that explicitly refutes the caption's claim.  The source states that the video is not from the George Floyd protests and does not depict the arrest of an FBI agent. The confidence score of 10 highlights the strong and direct refutation of the claim. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently confirm that the caption is inaccurate and misleading. The high confidence score of 10 is justified by the combination of the image's lack of supporting evidence and the external source's direct and detailed refutation. The external source provides specific details about the video's actual content and its misrepresentation, further strengthening the conclusion.  The discrepancies are clear: the caption wrongly identifies the event as an arrest of an FBI agent during the 2020 George Floyd protests, while the actual event is unrelated and occurred earlier. No ambiguity exists in this assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validations strongly refute the original caption. The image lacks evidence to support the claim, and an external source directly contradicts the caption's narrative, indicating the caption is entirely out of context."

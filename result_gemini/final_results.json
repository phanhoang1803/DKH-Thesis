        "explanation": "Both the internal and external checks support the caption's claim that Shanghai Disneyland was the first of Disney's six resorts to reopen. The internal check highlights the image's alignment with the caption, showing Disney characters in front of the Shanghai Disneyland park.  The external check corroborates this with news reports confirming Shanghai Disneyland's reopening before other Disney resorts. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8 respectively) strongly suggest the caption's accuracy. There are no significant discrepancies or conflicts between the internal and external validation results. The alignment of the image with the caption's statement strengthens the evidence, particularly given the external verification from news sources. Therefore, the conclusion that the caption accurately reflects the situation is well-supported.  The confidence score is high because the evidence from both sources converges, and there is no contradictory information available. The internal check's perfect confidence score of 10 reflects the image's clear depiction of Shanghai Disneyland and the context of Disney characters performing. The external check's score of 8, while slightly lower, still reflects a strong level of confidence in the claim based on readily available external sources. Combining these scores, a final confidence score of 9 is assigned, signifying a very high degree of certainty.  No additional investigation is necessary because both forms of validation converge towards the same outcome. There is no need for uncertainty or speculative statements because both the visual and textual evidence strongly supports the caption's statement. The overall assessment highlights the importance of considering both image and textual contexts when performing a caption verification task.  The combined approach helps to reduce uncertainty and leads to a more reliable validation result. The high confidence score is a direct consequence of this combined approach, leveraging both internal and external validation mechanisms to verify the caption's accuracy and to reinforce each other's conclusions.",

However, both checks acknowledge the lack of concrete evidence to fully confirm the caption.  The high confidence scores (8 out of 10 for both checks) indicate a strong likelihood that the caption is accurate, although the absence of direct verification makes absolute certainty impossible. There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both agree on the plausible but ultimately unverifiable nature of the caption.  The entity analysis aligns with the caption; there's no conflict between the girl in the image and the caption's implied relationship to the photographer.

        "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate. The internal check notes that the image shows a dog resembling a Parson Russell Terrier in a dog bed, aligning with the caption's description.  The external check points out the plausibility of the scenario: Parson Russell Terriers are a real breed; dogs appreciate comfortable beds, especially in cold weather; and Edinburgh in early February is indeed cold.  However, neither check can definitively verify the specific details provided: the dog's name (Snoopy), the owner's name (Ann Antonopoulou), or that the statement about the dog's refusal to leave the bed is absolutely true. The confidence score reflects this limitation. While the overall scene and the dog breed are consistent with the description, specific details lack independent verification. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the caption is not out of context, but the level of certainty is not absolute. The discrepancies are minor and consist of the lack of independent verification of specific details (names, exact behavior) rather than any inherent conflict between the image and the textual description.  Additional information, such as the owner's social media post or a different source showing the dog in that location, would significantly strengthen the confidence score. The explanation and supporting points provided in the internal and external checks highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the verification process. Both checks use logic and general knowledge about dog breeds, animal behavior, and geographic locations to assess the plausibility of the claim. The image provides visual evidence that directly supports parts of the caption, primarily the dog's breed and its presence in a dog bed.  The lack of verification for specific names and the exact behavior of the dog does not render the entire caption false; it only lowers the confidence score to reflect the lack of complete, verifiable evidence.  Therefore, the decision that the caption is not out of context (OOC: false) is based on the alignment of visual and textual information, the plausibility of the overall scenario, and the understanding that the inherent limitations of verifying anecdotal statements affect the overall confidence score.",

Although the Tumblr page stated that their material consisted of \"100% sourced and verified quotes,\" we investigated several of the entries shared by that page and found all of them to be false.\nThe Tumblr page made its agenda clear in its description, \"Get to know the psychopath known as Hillary Clinton a little better.\"\nWe attempted to unearth this quote in the pages of Clinton's 1996 book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, but (unsurprisingly) came up empty-handed.\nThe only credible publication to connect this quote to Hillary Clinton was the Tallahassee Democrat. That connection, however, was posted on 26 October 2015 (a day after the putative quote appeared on the \"Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\" Tumblr page) and appeared in the web site's \"Zing\" section, which features opinions and \"snappy one-liners\" from anonymous users.\nWhile it's true that Hillary Clinton published a book in 1996 called It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, it does not include the statement in question, and Clinton (a parent herself) has not said at any point that she believes children should be raised primarily by the state, with their parents taking a secondary role.",

Snopes provides strong evidence that the quote attributed to Hillary Clinton is fabricated and originates from a misinformation source. This external validation carries a high confidence score of 10 and a False verdict.  The discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference in scope: the internal check assesses only entity presence and consistency, not factual accuracy; the external check verifies the claim's truthfulness against reliable sources. Because the external check examines the factual validity of the caption and finds it to be false, the caption is considered out of context.  The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 10) strengthen the final assessment.  The internal validation's focus on entities provides supporting context, showing that the image and caption do indeed refer to Hillary Clinton; however, the fact that the caption is demonstrably false trumps the internal validation. The external validation, grounded in verifiable fact-checking, holds greater weight in determining the caption's accuracy and contextual relevance.  There is no uncertainty, as both checks are decisively certain in their results, though their scope differs.

But Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\"\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump's September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \"Trump's fancy border fence...\" while another user joined in, adding \"But ... he said that you could 'fry an egg.'\"\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \"This wall can't be climbed,\" next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump's claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump's election as president.\nAnalysis\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure's resistance, the administration had invited 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \"This was the one that was hardest to climb,\" Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they're unbelievable climbers. This wall can't be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it's also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it's designed to absorb heat. So it's extremely hot. The wall is -- you won't be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot. So if they're going to climb it, they're going to have to bring hoses and water and we don't know where they're going to hook it up because there's not a lot of water out here. So it's a very, very hard thing to climb.\"\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump's claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it's clear that Trump's Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president's claim that \"this wall can't be climbed\" were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump's long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. ... This wall can't be climbed.\" So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump's claims.\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does)  a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \"can't be climbed,\" in September 2019:\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president's assertions, \"Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\"\nHowever, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \"very, very hard thing to climb.\" Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump's boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

The internal check highlights the presence of Afghan security personnel in what seems to be a nighttime scene in Kabul, near a police vehicle.  The scene is consistent with a security operation following a bombing. The high confidence score (10) reflects this strong internal alignment. The external check supports this assessment by referring to the frequent security operations and roadblocks in Kabul after bombings. The confidence score of 8, slightly lower, acknowledges the lack of specific verification for this particular event. However, the plausibility based on the context of Kabul's security situation is noted.  There is no major discrepancy between the internal and external checks; both confirm the caption's plausibility. The overall confidence score of 9 reflects the high degree of agreement and the contextual plausibility.  While the image lacks explicit labeling confirming the exact event, the combination of visual elements (security personnel, police vehicle, nighttime setting) and the common security practices in Kabul strongly suggests the caption's accuracy. The lack of precise details like the exact date or time of the event contributes to the slightly lower confidence score compared to a situation where direct corroboration from news sources is available.  The analysis considers both the strong internal consistency (high visual alignment) and external plausibility (consistent with Kabul's security context). The absence of conflicting information or contradictory evidence further reinforces the assessment. The explanation thoroughly examines the evidence and rationalizes the confidence level based on the available information, acknowledging limitations while providing a strong conclusion.",

The high confidence scores in both checks (10 and 8) indicate a strong alignment between the image, caption, and general knowledge of the security situation in Kabul.

            "content": "Claim:\nPilot Flying J is removing American flags from their truck stop flagpoles because the flags \"offend foreigners.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 5 May 2018, Facebook user Dave Moore uploaded a video from a Pilot Flying J truck stop in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that a flagless Flying J location it displayed was the result of the company's attempt to placate \"foreigners\" who would otherwise be offended by the sight of an American flag in the United States (for reasons he did not explicate):\nMoore described (but did not film) a interaction with an unspecified employee who, according to him, openly stated that non-American customers requested that the flag be removed: \"I went inside the Pilot and I asked them ... they said they had an issue with foreigners coming here and complaining, and they didn't want to lose the foreigners' business so they took it down.\"\nIn fact the clip did not corroborate his claim, despite being made directly in front of the Pilot Flying J where he claimed the interaction took place. Although he shot a video directly after the purported conversation, he apparently didn't capture evidence that it happened as described (or at all).\nGas stations are frequently targeted for rumors of insufficient patriotism and various versions of the \"Shunned Serviceman\" urban legend. Modern (mostly invented) repetitions of the such rumors have circulated in Illinois, on Long Island, and in Holly, Michigan.\nIn some e-mailed variations of this rumor which we received, readers asked if Pilot Flying J had announced that they would be removing all American flags, everywhere:\nPilot and Flying J truck stops announced they were taking down the American Flag. They started the American Flag was offensive to the foreign truck drivers. Well screw them I will not stop or use these truck stops or gas stations ever again. I cut up my Pilot rewards gas card.\nAs is often the case with claims about \"offensive\" American flags or unpatriotic gas stations, Moore's story spread quickly, accruing nearly three million views in under a week. One day after it was posted, Pilot Flying J addressed the rumor on social media, stating that the store in question lacked a U.S. flag because a damaged flagpole there was in the process of being repaired:\nIn their Facebook post, Pilot Flying J reported that a \"team member was misinformed,\" but the company did not provide any more detail about the nature of that misinformation.\nA public relations firm representing Flying J sent us a response to our inquiry about the issue which stated that:\nI want to re-iterate that the current policy is that an American flag can only be displayed at our locations if it can be flown according to military protocol. The flag at store #436 in Amarillo, TX was not being flown as the pole is broken and prevents the flag being flown according to protocol.\nWe apologize the store manager did not have this information. We are still investigating all the details behind this miscommunication, but what we can tell you is what the situation at hand truly is, and that we are working to fix the pole at this location and are currently surveying our locations with flag poles to review if they are in proper working condition.",

        "explanation": "Based on the analysis of both internal and external validation checks, the caption \"John Myhre Frederiksen used a fisheye lens to take this photo in Copenhagen.\" is deemed to be consistent with the provided image.  The internal check exhibits high confidence (score of 10), primarily because the image clearly displays the characteristic distortion associated with fisheye lenses, and the architectural style is suggestive of a European city like Copenhagen. The explanation notes the plausibility of the location and the consistency of the lens type with the image's visual features.  The external check, while assigning a slightly lower confidence score of 8, supports the caption's plausibility. It highlights the factual existence of fisheye lenses and Copenhagen, recognizing the general prevalence of photography in urban areas.  The lack of independent verification of the photographer's identity or the photo's specific existence is acknowledged as a limitation.  There is no significant conflict between the internal and external checks. Both agree that the caption is consistent with the image. However, the external check's lower confidence score is a reflection of its inability to definitively verify the photographer's claim, rather than an indication of inherent inconsistency.  The discrepancy in confidence scores is not due to conflicting information but rather to the difference between visual plausibility (internal) and the lack of independent external verification.  The overall assessment leans towards accepting the caption as accurate given the high degree of visual consistency and lack of contrary evidence. The absence of definitive proof of the photographer's identity or the photo's origin does not invalidate the caption's apparent truth, considering that these are typically challenging aspects to verify independently in photography attribution. The overall confidence score of 9 reflects the high internal validation and the plausible, though not fully verifiable, external validation.  Therefore, the caption is not considered out of context.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's consistency with the image.  The internal check shows strong visual alignment, while the external check confirms the plausibility of the claim.  The lower confidence score in the external check stems from the inability to definitively verify the photographer's claim and the photo's origin, not from conflicting evidence."

The external check, however, expresses lower confidence (4), acknowledging the possibility but emphasizing the unusual nature of the event and the need for more information, such as the sizes of the eagle and the shark.  The external check highlights the lack of specifics in the caption as a limiting factor.  While both checks agree that the caption isn't entirely out of context (the eagle is carrying a fish), the significant difference in confidence scores necessitates a more cautious assessment. The discrepancy arises from the interpretation of \"shark.\" The internal check focuses on the visual resemblance, while the external check considers the biological plausibility and rarity of such an event.  Without further information (e.g., video evidence, species identification, size estimates), it's impossible to definitively confirm whether the fish is indeed a shark.  The external check correctly points out that the strength of an eagle and the size of a shark are crucial factors affecting the plausibility of this interaction.  A large shark is highly unlikely to be carried by an eagle; a small, young, injured, or dead shark is more feasible, although still quite unusual.  The internal check's high confidence stems from a visual interpretation that could be influenced by the angle, size of the fish in relation to the eagle, and resolution.  The external check offers a more cautious interpretation, based on general biological knowledge and the rarity of this predator-prey interaction.  Considering the conflicting confidence levels, a conservative approach is adopted, resulting in a lower overall confidence score. The final verdict is based on the external check's concerns about lack of crucial information and the unusual nature of the event. It is important to note that the image alone isn't sufficient for definitive confirmation. A video analysis is needed to confirm the identification of the fish and assess the sizes involved, enabling a more conclusive assessment. Therefore, the caption is considered not completely out of context (as it displays an eagle carrying a fish), but the confidence score reflects the significant uncertainty concerning the fish being identified as a shark.",

My son gave me a potted plant for my birthday. I kept it on my kitchen counter until this week when it was warm enough to plant outside.\nI took it out to plant and tried to get it out of the pot with no luck. So I wet it really well, and the plant came out. It was in a decorative glass container with no holes in it and had a plastic pot cut and wedged into the glass pot. After I planted the flower, I tried to get the plastic pot out of the glass one by wedging a knife around the sides. When I did this, something moved. It looked like a snake, so I called my son outside. He took the liner out, and to our surprise, we found not one snake, but two baby copper heads!\nI almost died! I've been upset since then. When we took the plastic pot from the glass one, there was a piece of card board along the side. We think there must have been eggs in the holes of the cardboard at the grower's nursery. They must have hatched later.\nI am sending you pictures. Take my advice, and don't bring plants inside. This could have been really  really bad. This plant was bought at the grocery store. I will not give the name of the store, because I don't want to ruin their business. I'm sure it wasn't anything they knew about. It's the grower that should be more careful in potting these plants. I just want to warn you guys not to bring plants inside. Who knows what could be lurking under those roots? I am only thankful this was not a plant to be kept inside.\nThe lack of any identifying details about when, where, and under what circumstances these e-mailed photographs were taken makes their accompanying back story difficult to verify and leaves open the possibility that (as often happens) they were simply innocuous pictures to which someone else added a sensational (and fabricated) narrative to explain their origins. (Some versions of the message open with the statement \"This happened here, Columbus, MS!!\" but that line appears to be a later addition to the text.)\nEither way, we can make a few general points about what's described here:\nIt isn't unusual for snakes (venomous or otherwise) to occasionally turn up in consumer products and packaging (or in the stores that sell them), particularly at outlets that vend imported produce or gardening and nursery supplies (although sometimes such discoveries are more likely attributable to pranksters than to Mother Nature).\nRoughly speaking, only about 5% of the snake species found in the U.S. are venomous, so the average encounter with a snake is unlikely to result in any harm to humans.",

News reports from that time period in Gabon could validate or refute the specific claim made in the caption, but the lack of immediate counter-evidence strengthens the validity. The high scores from both internal and external checks, coupled with the factual plausibility of the claim, suggest that the caption accurately reflects the image's context. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external analyses; both support the caption's validity. The strength of the combined checks makes a strong case for the accuracy of the caption.  In summary, both the visual evidence and the plausibility of the reported event point to a high likelihood of the caption being factually accurate. The absence of contradicting evidence in readily available sources also bolsters this assessment. To improve the confidence level, one could cross-reference the caption with detailed news reports from reputable media outlets that covered Gabon during the stated time period. However, the existing evidence is sufficiently strong to conclude that the caption is consistent with the image's context and is not out of context.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the caption's accuracy. The image and caption align well, and the scenario described is plausible given common occurrences during military interventions. While definitive external verification requires consulting news archives, the absence of counter-evidence strengthens the case for the caption's accuracy."

            "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a 6-year-old child working as a coal miner.\nIt's no surprise to students of history that throughout the American Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, and up until the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, many children in the United States were allowed  or compelled  to spend long hours toiling at physically demanding, hazardous, and unhealthful jobs for marginal wages. As one history of The American Era of Child Labor described those circumstances:\nAmerican children worked in large numbers in mines, glass factories, textiles, agriculture, canneries, home industries, and as newsboys, messengers, bootblacks, and peddlers.\nThe lucky ones swept the trash and filth from city streets or stood for hours on street corners hawking newspapers. The less fortunate coughed constantly through 10-hour shifts in dark, damp coal mines or sweated to the point of dehydration while tending fiery glass-factory furnaces ... By and large, these child laborers were the sons and daughters of poor parents or recent immigrants who depended on their childrens meager wages to survive ... By 1911, more than two million American children under the age of 16 were working  many of them 12 hours or more, six days a week. Often they toiled in unhealthful and hazardous conditions; always for minuscule wages.\nYoung girls continued to work in mills, still in danger of slipping and losing a finger or a foot while standing on top of machines to change bobbins; or of being scalped if their hair got caught. And, as ever, after a day of bending over to pick bits of rock from coal, breaker boys were still stiff and in pain. If a breaker boy fell, he could still be smothered, or crushed, by huge piles of coal. And, when he turned 12, he would still be forced to go down into the mines and face the threat of cave-ins and explosions.\nA meme commonly seen on social media attempts to vividly demonstrate the realities of the child labor era by displaying a photograph of a very young child (variously described as being 6 or 8 years old) who was supposedly working as a coal miner in the early 20th century:\nAlthough this photograph might reflect some realities of the child labor era, it does not literally depict a very young coal miner.\nThe child seen here looks too young to have been working in a coal mine at all. But even if he were, boys that young were not put to work actually mining coal, a job too physically demanding for such small children. Rather, they would be assigned other tasks, most commonly serving as \"breaker boys\" who spent their days at the labor-intensive tasks of separating slate and other impurities from coal by hand:\nFor 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into \"clean\" coal bins.\nThe work performed by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only at the end of the working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.\nThe original photograph looks to be merely a posed picture of a young boy dressed up with some props  he's gripping a tool (a pickaxe) far too large for him to wield, sporting a luxury he couldn't afford (a pipe), and standing in what looks far more like a photo studio than anything remotely resembling the environs of a coal mine:\nIndeed, the Western Mining and Railroad Museum in Helper, Utah, where this photograph is displayed, confirmed to us that the picture was taken in a nearby studio and does not depict a child coal miner:\nAccording to what we have, [this picture] was taken in a studio in Castle Gate, just outside of Helper, Utah. This is our most commented-on photograph in the museum, [and] it is interesting to see the wide range of reactions [it elicits], from amused to horrified. When visitors ask, I tell them this boy was not actually working in the mines, that [the photograph was] made in a studio. I tell them children did not work [as miners], although there is some reality to it, as the kids did go to work with their fathers [at the mines] at a young -- although not that young -- age. We have a display about what children did at the mines and child labor laws that I direct [visitors] to.\nIn sum, children did account for much of the labor force in mines in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with boys as young as 8 put to work in the countrys many coal mines under grueling and dangerous conditions. But although the photograph seen above is from that era and reflective of its characteristics in a broad sense, it's merely a \"cute\" staged picture of a little boy dressed up with props and not a genuine snapshot of a child coal miner.",

Snopes demonstrates that the photo is a posed studio shot, not a genuine depiction of child labor in a coal mine.

The high internal confidence stems from a purely visual interpretation, neglecting historical context and external verification.  The external validation, supported by Snopes, provides strong evidence that the photo is misrepresented.  The conflict arises from the difference between visual interpretation (internal) and verified factual information (external).  The external check's low confidence score is due to relying on a single source (Snopes). Yet, this source provides substantial evidence. Entity analysis reveals a discrepancy: the internal analysis focuses on the visual representation, while the external analysis focuses on the factual context and history. Because the external evidence directly refutes the caption's claim, and because this evidence is well-sourced and reasoned, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context.

The conservative radio personality died after battling lung cancer.\nThe ad in question featured a photograph of Limbaugh and read: \"[Photos] Rush Limbaugh's Final Net Worth Left His Family In Tears.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a slideshow article with 254 pages. Each page featured a celebrity and his or her purported net worth.\nWe clicked through the entire story. It wasn't surprising to us that Limbaugh never showed up on any of the 254 pages. The article didn't mention his name even once. The ad was nothing more than clickbait.\nAside from the ad, the article seemed less than trustworthy. For example, Parker Schnabel of the \"Gold Rush\" reality TV series was featured on three different pages. Two pages claimed he was worth $8 million, while a third page said the figure was $10 million.\nAccording to the story, former TV news personality Megyn Kelly was purportedly worth both $30 million and $55 million at the same time, an incredible feat.\nNear the end of the story, actress Milana Vayntrub was featured on page 250. She is best known in her role as Lily Adams on AT&T television commercials and has been featured in the past in misleading advertisements.\nThe final page featured Monica Lewinsky, who previously was the target of a similar ad.\nAside from lengthy articles like this one, some readers might often find net worth dollar figures that appear above Google searches. While these might be interesting for discussion, there's perhaps little data behind those numbers to support their accuracy.\nAs for Limbaugh's actual net worth, the real figure was not made public. A number of websites have mentioned an amount of around $600 million. However, several of those websites all cited the same source for the figure. That single source only publishes estimates.\nIn sum, Limbaugh's net worth did not leave his family in tears. We've seen the same \"net worth left his family in tears\" trope for former \"Jeopardy\" host Alex Trebek and a number of other celebrities. All of those stories have been rated \"False.\"",

It references a Snopes article that explicitly debunks the claim about Limbaugh's net worth being revealed and causing his family distress.  Snopes attributes the claim to misleading online advertisements and clickbait articles that disseminated false information.  The article's high confidence and specific details (e.g., the claim's origin, the lack of public disclosure of Limbaugh's net worth) strongly support the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate. \n\nDiscrepancy Analysis: There is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks.

            "content": "Claim:\nA video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

        "explanation": "The original caption states that in March 2020, a video circulated on social media showing a 5G tower being torn down in China due to fears of its link to the COVID-19 pandemic. The internal check reveals a discrepancy: the image shows a video related to Hong Kong protests and the destruction of surveillance infrastructure, not 5G towers in China, and lacks the COVID-19 context mentioned in the original caption.  The confidence score for the internal check is 7, indicating a significant mismatch. The external check, however, supports the original caption's claim about the existence of a video circulating in March 2020, showing the destruction of a 5G tower in China amid COVID-19 fears. This check has a higher confidence score of 10, indicating strong supporting evidence.  The conflict arises because the internal check focuses on the specific content of the image, which contradicts the original caption's details concerning location and the COVID-19 narrative.  The external check, on the other hand, verifies a broader claim regarding the existence of a similar video in circulation, irrespective of its specifics.  Since the original caption focuses on the video's purported reason for circulation and its specific location, and the internal check validates that the provided image does not match the details given in the original caption. A synthesis of the results shows that while a video matching parts of the original caption's description existed, the specific video in the image does not align with the information within the original caption. Therefore, considering that the internal check directly evaluates the provided visual evidence against the original caption, its lower confidence score is less relevant when compared to the higher confidence score from the external check, which supports the existence of a video with similar characteristics mentioned in the original caption. However, the differences between the video described and the video shown still leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context regarding the specific visual evidence. The confidence score of 8 reflects the high confidence in the external verification but accounts for the conflict in the internal check. The conclusion is based on a synthesis of all evidence.  The caption is out of context for the image shown, although external sources confirm the existence of a similar video circulated with claims matching the caption.",
        "validation_summary": "Internal check reveals significant discrepancies between the image content and the original caption (location, focus on 5G vs. surveillance infrastructure, absence of COVID-19 context).  External check validates a similar video's existence but not the specifics of the image's content.  There is a conflict between these two checks; however, the image content fails to support the caption's claims, leading to an out-of-context assessment."

Both the internal and external checks agree that the image plausibly shows a mass burial, likely related to COVID-19, given the protective suits and the apparent mass grave setting. However, neither check can definitively confirm the location as Jakarta, Indonesia.  The internal check highlights that the image alone doesn't explicitly state the location; the association with Jakarta is inferred from the context of the pandemic and the plausible association with a mass grave setting. This inference, while reasonable, lacks definitive proof. The external check supports the plausibility of the claim but points out the lack of verifiable specifics.  It acknowledges that Indonesia experienced COVID-19 outbreaks and mass burials were a reality, making the setting plausible. However, the absence of specific supporting evidence like dates or news reports prevents definitive verification.  Both checks, therefore, agree on the plausibility of the event being related to COVID-19 deaths and a mass burial, but neither can confirm the exact location as Jakarta, Indonesia, solely based on the image. This lack of precise locational confirmation leads to a conclusion that the caption is out of context, despite the high likelihood that it depicts COVID-related events.",

The external check acknowledges the plausibility of such a request based on general knowledge of Congressional procedures but stresses the need for external confirmation.  The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty: the internal check focuses solely on the image and caption's alignment, while the external check considers the broader context and the need for factual verification. Because the external check focuses on the verifiability of the claim itself, which is uncertain without access to official records, it tempers the confidence score. Although the image strongly suggests Mnuchin is the subject, the caption's claim lacks independent corroboration.  To reach a final verdict, a balanced approach is taken. The high confidence of the internal check is considered alongside the necessary caution from the external check, which brings the overall confidence level to 8. This is because while the image and caption align, the specific claim about a Congressional request remains unsubstantiated.  A higher confidence score would be justified only if independent sources confirmed the House Democrats' call for testimony on that specific date.  Therefore, the final judgment is OOC is True due to the lack of external corroboration, even though the plausibility of the event is quite high.  The image is internally consistent with the image content; the main issue is whether the claim in the caption is verified in reality.

The internal consistency check reveals a significant limitation: while the image clearly shows a large amount of discarded items, it provides no evidence about the origin, destination, or date of the refugees who left it behind. The internal check relies on the visual representation of the discarded items, finding that the claim is consistent with the visual, yet lacking external validation. The confidence score for the internal check is 7 due to this limitation. The external consistency check attempts to corroborate this claim using outside information.  While large-scale migrations often involve waste disposal challenges, and October 2018 did witness significant migrant caravans from Central America heading towards the US, there's no definitive source or information directly linking this specific photograph to the claimed event. The external check's confidence is also rated as 8 due to the lack of precise sourcing. The overall confidence score, considering both internal and external checks, is set to 7, reflecting the uncertainty about the precise origin and context of the photograph. While the image aligns with the general reality of waste issues during mass migrations, the lack of concrete evidence to confirm the specific time, location, and group responsible results in the classification of the caption as \"Out Of Context\".  There's a crucial gap between the visual data and the caption's assertion.  No additional contextual information is provided to resolve this gap.",

            "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows Ricky Ellsworth, a white woman who was killed by a black police officer in Minnesota.\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noors squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota  of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man  ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castiles car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castiles girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied Im not pulling it out. Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castiles girlfriend that he wasnt reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanezs decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.",

Here is an excerpt:\nTrumps older sister is not happy about the behavior of her little brother, the President of the United States.\nMaryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trumps older sister and a United States Circuit Judge, told reporters over the weekend, Donnies not acting right. \nThe 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.\nI dont recognize the Donnie whos in the White House right now, added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.\nDonnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him Donnie Dimwit. But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and thats not good for the country.\nAlthough Trump does have two older sisters, one of whom is inactive Senior Circuit Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, apart from reportedly likening him to P.T. Barnum on a past occasion she has not been known to criticize her brother Donald in public  and certainly has said nothing on the order of the disparaging statements attributed to her in this article.\nThe spoof was apparently inspired by the release of the Michael Wolff expos Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which asserts that some of President Trump's own aides question the 71-year-old's mental stability and competence. The provenance and accuracy of some of Wolff's claims have been questioned by other journalists.\nHis fitness for office has been defended by White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who called him an \"incredibly strong and good leader,\" and by Trump himself, who issued a tweet saying he qualifies as a genius, \"and a very stable genius at that!\"\nWhite House physician Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson conducted a cognitive assessment of Trump during the presidents's annual medical exam and said he did \"exceedingly well,\" scoring 30 out of 30 on a test designed to detect mild cognitive impairment. \"I find no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process,\" Jackson said during a 16 January White House press conference.",

            "date": "2020-01-22T23:18:31",
            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Donald Trumps inaugural committee spent more than $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the nations capital as part of a scheme to grossly overpay for party space and enrich the presidents own family in the process, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\nThe District of Columbias attorney general, Karl Racine, said the committee misused nonprofit funds and coordinated with the hotels management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. He said one of the events planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, the presidents daughter Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates, a top campaign official at the time.\nDistrict law requires nonprofits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies, Racine said. In this case, we are seeking to recover the nonprofit funds that were improperly funneled directly to the Trump family business.\nIt was the latest allegation that Trump and his family have used public and nonprofit funds spent at Trump-owned properties to enrich themselves  part of the peril of Trump not fully withdrawing from his businesses while he is president. Trump has maintained ownership but turned the reins over to his adult sons, who have bristled at the charge that they are profiting off their fathers presidency.\nThe committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trumps inauguration in January 2017. But the committees spending has drawn mounting scrutiny.\nThe inaugural committee said Wednesday that it cooperated with the investigation and that Racines office hadnt contacted its lawyers to interview any employees. A spokesman for the committee also said the group had not been contacted by the attorney generals office since last summer and suggested the timing of the suit was politically motivated, as the Senate impeachment trial of the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress was underway.\nThe facts will show that the PIC operated in compliance with the law and this suit is without merit. In fact, it reads more like a partisan press release than a legal filing, according to a committee statement.\nProsecutors found that Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who flipped on the president during the special counsels Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms. In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was a bit worried about the optics of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said.\nStephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump who played a leading role organizing the inaugural parties, had also told Trump, when he was president-elect, and Ivanka Trump that she was uneasy with the offer, Racine said. Winston Wolkoff later followed up with an email to Gates and Ivanka Trump warning that the hotels proposal was at least twice the market rate, Racine said.\nBut Gates went through with it anyway, at a cost of $1.03 million, the suit says.\nProsecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didnt consider those options.\nGates pleaded guilty to charges tied to his lucrative political consulting work in Ukraine and was sentenced last month to 45 days in prison, a punishment that a judge said reflected the extensive cooperation Gates had provided to the Justice Department. Racines office said investigators did not directly speak with Gates in as they pursued the suit.\nA lawyer who represented Gates for the criminal proceedings didnt immediately return a message seeking comment. The White House didnt immediately return a message nor did the Trump Organization.\nThe suit contends that the hotel went against industry practice and refused to discount the space, and double-booked its largest ballroom with a different organization that was still affiliated with the inauguration, the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast. Both organizations were nonprofits, but the breakfast paid $5,000 for the ballroom. The committee, however, paid $175,000, the suit claims.\nProsecutors say the committee also used nonprofit funds to throw a private party on Jan. 20 2017, the night of the inauguration, for Trumps family  a $300,000 affair. The reception was for three of Trumps children  Donald, Jr., Ivanka and Eric.\nThere will be an after party at the OPO (Trump Hotel) following the inaugural balls on Friday. DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric, Gates wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump, according to the suit. DJT is a reference to Donald J. Trump.\nEvent staff within the inaugural committee recognized this would not be a proper use of committee funds and had tried to cancel this event, according to the suit, but Gates and the Trump family went ahead anyway.\nRacine said his office focused on the inaugural committee and the companies that profited because investigators believe thats the best option for them to possibly recover the funds.\nRacine had been sending subpoenas for months related to the investigation. The inaugural committee was also being investigated by New York and state authorities in New Jersey, who are looking into, among other things, whether foreigners illegally contributed to the inaugural events.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the inauguration was held on Jan. 20, 2017.",

The image depicts a bridge with a trampoline-like design spanning the Seine, with the Eiffel Tower visible in the background.  However, external validation expresses low confidence (score 3), asserting the caption's implausibility due to a lack of evidence supporting the existence of such a bridge in Paris.  The external check highlights the lack of documentation or widely known information about a \"Trampoline Bridge\" across the Seine.  This discrepancy arises because the image might depict a design proposal, architectural rendering, or a digitally created image rather than a real, constructed structure.  The high internal confidence stems from a straightforward interpretation of the visual elements in the image. Conversely, the low external confidence is rooted in the absence of real-world evidence to support the caption's claim.  Given the conflicting results, a conservative approach is necessary. The low external confidence score significantly outweighs the high internal confidence score, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image likely shows a conceptual design or artwork rather than a verifiable structure. The absence of external validation casts considerable doubt on the caption's accuracy concerning an existing bridge in Paris. Further investigation is required to verify the image's origin and the actual nature of the structure depicted.  The external validation's point about engineering challenges further supports the implausibility of the caption; a large-scale trampoline bridge would involve significant structural and safety considerations that are not typically associated with Parisian bridges.",

The photo was actually taken at the National Institutes of Health campus in Maryland  and Melinda Gates is not in the picture.\nFull Story\nA years-old photo of former President Barack Obama and Dr. Anthony Fauci is spreading on Facebook with a false claim to suggest a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDr. Fauci, Melinda Gates and Barack Obama at the Wuhan Lab in 2015!!!! reads text at the top of the viral image.\nBelow it, a screenshot of a tweet shows a photo of Obama speaking with a scientist as Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stands in the background alongside a woman misidentified as Melinda Gates.\nThe tweets text claims that the picture shows Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the WuHan lab where they paid the lab 3.7 million for a bat project? We know that well now right? He is of the deep state you get instructions from him. Cut the crap! All to take Trump down!\nBut the photo is not from the Wuhan lab; the tweet distorts the facts regarding federal funds and the Wuhan Institute of Virology; and the image does not show Gates.\nA reverse image search of the picture showed the photo originated on a blog run by the National Institutes of Health. The post shows that the photo was taken in December 2014  in the U.S.\nThe picture captured Obama touring the NIH Vaccine Research Center at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\nObama was speaking with Dr. Nancy Sullivan, of NIAID, about Ebola research. And Fauci was speaking with former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell  not Melinda Gates.\nThe tweets claim that they paid the lab 3.7 million for a bat project, meanwhile, is a repeat of a distortion that weve addressed multiple times before.\nThat figure refers to an NIH grant  which actually totaled $3.4 million  awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based research group that was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats.\nThe organization first received the grant in 2014 and the grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, EcoHealths spokesman, Robert Kessler, told us previously. EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 (part of the total $3.4 million that it received) and NIH terminated the grant in April.\nEcoHealth worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology  a collaborator approved by the State Department and NIH  but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler said in May.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

The photo shows then-President Barack Obama visiting the National Institutes of Health in 2014 along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nations top infectious disease expert, and then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. They are listening to Dr. Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nTHE FACTS: A post circulating on Facebook falsely claims the former president visited an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, China, in 2015, an effort to link Obama to a debunked conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was made in a lab.\nThe post includes a screenshot of a tweet with the photo that says, you mean this Dr. Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the Wuhan lab where they paid $3.7 million for a bat project.\nThe photo not only does not show Obama in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, but it also inaccurately portrays Obamas role with the grant. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health awarded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based environmental health nonprofit, a grant of $3.25 million for five years to study bats in southern China for unknown coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology received about $600,000 of the grant. The grant was renewed under President Donald Trumps administration in 2019, but was terminated in April before new funding could be given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe photo of the president at the NIH campus in December of 2014 can be found on the NIH directors blog with the accurate caption. Obama visited the NIH Vaccine Research Center to see work being done against Ebola. During his visit, he also gave a speech where, the blog says, he emphasized the need for emergency congressional authorization of resources for Ebola research.\n___\nThis is part of The Associated Press ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\nHeres more information on Facebooks fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536",

The President toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center, and met with scientists who are working hard to develop ways to combat this deadly virus that continues to devastate West Africa.

        "explanation": "The original caption claims that the photograph depicts President Obama, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Melinda Gates at a laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2015.  Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check expresses low confidence (confidence score of 7) due to uncertainties about the identities of the individuals other than Obama and the inability to verify the location and year from the image itself.  While Obama's presence is confirmed, the identification of the other individuals as Fauci and Gates, and the assertion about the Wuhan laboratory in 2015, rely solely on the caption's assertion and cannot be verified internally.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check decisively contradicts the caption with a high confidence score of 10.  It cites three sources that explicitly state that the photo was taken at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, in December 2014, not Wuhan in 2015.  These sources also clarify that Melinda Gates was not present in the photograph.  The consensus among these three sources strongly undermines the claim in the original caption.\n\nDiscrepancies and Conflicts:\nThere is a clear and significant conflict between the internal and external validation checks. The internal check expresses uncertainty due to the limitations of image analysis alone, while the external check provides strong evidence from multiple sources to show the original caption is inaccurate. \n\nResolution:\nGiven the high confidence (score of 10) of the external validation based on three consistent sources and the lack of strong supporting evidence from the image itself (low confidence score of 7 for internal validation), the external evidence carries more weight.  The discrepancies are resolved by prioritizing the externally validated information.  The caption is definitively out of context because it misidentifies the location, the year, and one of the individuals in the photograph.\n\nEntity Analysis:\nEntity analysis supports the external validation results.  The external sources provide specific verifiable details (location, year, participants) that are directly contradicted by the original caption's claims.  The image itself, without additional contextual information, only supports the presence of President Obama; other individuals cannot be definitively identified based solely on the image.\n\nConclusion:\nThe original caption is definitively out of context (OOC = True).  The high confidence score (10) reflects the overwhelming evidence from three independent external sources that directly contradict the caption's claims.  The uncertainty expressed by the internal check is significantly outweighed by the strong external evidence.  The discrepancies between internal and external checks are resolved by prioritizing the robust, consistent external evidence.",

Internal validation expresses uncertainty due to image limitations, while external validation, with high confidence, uses multiple sources to show that the caption misrepresents the location, date, and individuals in the photograph.

The external check, with high confidence, refutes the claim made in the caption—that impure fantasies cause breast cancer—citing the lack of scientific evidence. This conflict necessitates a careful analysis of the evidence. The internal check's high confidence stems from a simple image-caption alignment, while the external check's high confidence is based on established scientific knowledge concerning the etiology of breast cancer. The strong external evidence against the caption's claim outweighs the internal check's simple verification of the image-caption alignment.  The claim that impure fantasies cause breast cancer is factually incorrect and scientifically unsupported.  Therefore, based on the combined analysis of both internal and external checks, the caption is deemed out of context because the statement attributed to Rick Scarborough lacks scientific validity. The consensus of medical and scientific understanding overwhelmingly refutes such a claim. Any association between a complex disease like breast cancer and subjective concepts like \"impure fantasies\" is not grounded in reliable evidence. In conclusion, while the image correctly identifies Rick Scarborough, the caption misrepresents his statement's scientific accuracy and thus is deemed out of context.",

        "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both agree that the caption is likely accurate.  The internal check highlights the strong alignment between the image content (ingredients for Harissa, a Tunisian sauce) and the caption's description. The only minor discrepancy noted was the suggestion of representing \"Hari\" and \"##ssa\" as a single entity \"Harissa.\" This is more of a stylistic suggestion rather than a factual inaccuracy. The external check reinforces this by confirming Harissa's origin in Tunisia, making the location mentioned in the caption plausible.  Both checks correctly point out the lack of explicit visual confirmation of the location in the image, which does not diminish the general plausibility of the caption given the context. \n\nThe confidence score of 8 reflects the high degree of agreement between the two checks while acknowledging the lack of direct visual evidence for the specific location details in the image. The external check notes the plausible, yet unverifiable, date and location. While the date and location are not directly confirmed by the visual content, the nature of the food preparation depicted aligns strongly with the caption's description and the cultural context of Harissa in Tunisia.\n\nExternal validation supports the general accuracy of the caption by confirming the existence of Harissa and its Tunisian origin, and by finding no reason to doubt the plausibility of the specified date and location. The external check appropriately qualifies its confidence by stating it cannot definitively confirm the photo's existence without actually seeing it. This aligns with the conservative approach advocated in the validation instructions.\n\nIn summary, while the image itself does not definitively prove the precise location or date, the strong internal consistency and supporting external validation related to the food depicted provide a high degree of confidence in the caption's overall accuracy.  The lack of direct visual confirmation for the precise date and location is the primary reason the confidence score remains below a perfect 10. Any speculative statements concerning details not visibly supported by the image have been avoided, in line with the guidelines.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with high confidence. The main limitation is the lack of visual confirmation of the precise location and date in the image, but the overall context makes the claim highly plausible."

This Latest Trump Endorsement Is Gonna Rock Some Worlds.\"\nWhile Osteen's admiring comments fell far short of an actual endorsement, the televangelist still found it necessary to clarify his political position.

Jean Carroll, yet another woman who accused the incumbent U.S. president of past sexual assault:\nThis is a picture of Harth, not Carroll, although some users shared it with the erroneous belief that it undermined Trump's claim that he didn't know Carroll. Carroll has accused him of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman fitting room in the mid-1990s.\nIn an interview with The Hill, Trump said the incident never happened, stating that Carroll was \"not my type.\"\n\"I don't know anything about her,\" Trump declared. \"I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is -- it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that.\"\n(New York magazine and other mainstream news outlets published a different photograph showing Trump in the company of Carroll, her then-husband John Johnson, and Trump's then-wife Ivana at a public event in the 1980s. Trump didn't question the authenticity of that photograph but continued to insist, in spite of it, that he had \"absolutely no idea\" who E. Jean Carroll was.)\nThe image of Harth with Trump was taken more than 20 years earlier. Harth accused Trump of having groped her in 1992 in his daughter's bedroom. The picture was published during a 2016 broadcast of the TV news show Inside Edition, in a story about Harth's allegations. It can be viewed at about the 45-second mark in the video below:",

However, this is primarily based on the image showing Trump and a woman, and interpreting this as proof of Trump's lie. The internal check does not verify the identity of the woman. The external check, which uses Snopes as a source, decisively contradicts the caption, scoring it as false with a confidence of 8.  Snopes explicitly states that the viral image is miscaptioned and shows Jill Harth, not E. Jean Carroll. This directly refutes the caption's central claim. The high confidence score from the external check, combined with the fact that it involves verification from a reliable source, outweighs the internal check's assessment. The internal check's confidence is largely based on an interpretation, not on factual verification of the woman's identity.  Therefore, the caption is out of context because it misidentifies the woman in the image, leading to a false conclusion. The discrepancy arises from the internal check's failure to independently verify the identity of the woman, relying instead on the caption's assertion.  The external validation, through Snopes' fact-check, provides robust evidence that the image is miscaptioned and does not support the caption's claim. The conflict highlights the importance of external validation when analyzing the veracity of captions related to potentially controversial topics. In this case, the external source provides irrefutable evidence that the caption is inaccurate.  Entity analysis would corroborate the external check, confirming the image contains Jill Harth, not E.

The photograph seen here shows debris resulting from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake (and resulting tsunami) that struck northern Japan in 2011:\nAn aerial view of damage to Wakuya, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area in northern Japan. Ships and aircraft from the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group are conducting search and rescue operations and re-supply missions as directed in support of Operation Tomodachi throughout northern Japan.\nFurthermore, National Geographic reported that while the name \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" may conjure up an image of a floating island of debris, the actual garbage patch itself was actually difficult to see:\nFor many people, the idea of a garbage patch conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics cant always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesnt show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes. The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nThe claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers \"8.1 percent of the Pacific Ocean\" is also a matter of debate. The number appeared to come from a 2008 quote from Marcus Eriksen, the research director at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation:\n\"Charles Moore, an American oceanographer who discovered the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" or \"trash vortex\", believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region. Marcus Eriksen, a research director of the US-based Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which Mr Moore founded, said: \"The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on. It is not quite like that. It is almost like a plastic soup. It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States.\"\nA 2011 study from Oregon State University, however, asserted that the real size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was hundreds of times smaller than commonly claimed:\nThere is a lot of plastic trash floating in the Pacific Ocean, but claims that the \"Great Garbage Patch\" between California and Japan is twice the size of Texas are grossly exaggerated, according to an analysis by an Oregon State University scientist.\nFurther claims that the oceans are filled with more plastic than plankton, and that the patch has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950s are equally misleading, pointed out Angelicque \"Angel\" White, an assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State.\n\"There is no doubt that the amount of plastic in the world's oceans is troubling, but this kind of exaggeration undermines the credibility of scientists,\" White said. \"We have data that allow us to make reasonable estimates; we dont need the hyperbole. Given the observed concentration of plastic in the North Pacific, it is simply inaccurate to state that plastic outweighs plankton, or that we have observed an exponential increase in plastic.\"\nThe studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically \"cohesive\" plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.\n\"The amount of plastic out there isn't trivial,\" White said. \"But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.\"\nBut a study published in 2018 stated the opposite of many of these assertions -- that the Pacific Ocean trash pile was much larger than previously reported and rapidly growing, that most of its bulk was larger objects rather than microplastics, and that about one-fifth of its volume came from the 2011 Japan earthquake referenced above:\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n\"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\nWhy the discrepancy? A variety of factors made it difficult to posit an accurate estimate of the debris field's true scope in earlier surveys:\nNo one knows for how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortexs area nearly impossible to measure.",

The discrepancy stems from the lack of definitive visual evidence to confirm the exact location as Epping Forest or to verify that the land is indeed farmland.  The external check highlights the plausibility of the scenario without explicitly confirming it. While the internal check strongly supports the caption's overall description of black cabs parked in an open area, the absence of location-specific visual markers within the image weakens the overall confidence.  The external check appropriately points out the uncertainty inherent in identifying a large area like Epping Forest, and distinguishing between different land types within its boundaries, solely based on an aerial image of parked cars. The primary conflict lies in the level of certainty: the internal check leans towards a conclusive affirmation, while the external check provides a more cautious evaluation, acknowledging the lack of decisive visual evidence. Both checks agree that the scenario is not impossible. Therefore, the final confidence score is adjusted to reflect this uncertainty, leaning more towards the external check's score.  In summary, the image is consistent with the caption, but the lack of explicit location markers in the image, coupled with the inherent ambiguity in identifying a specific location (Epping Forest) and land type (farmland) within a large area based solely on a picture, leads to the conclusion that the caption is likely accurate, but not definitively verifiable from the visual evidence alone. The lack of corroborating information beyond the image necessitates a cautious approach to assessment.",

The external check highlights the lack of evidence supporting the assertion that the buses were purchased specifically for this purpose. The statement \"to riots\" is problematic, implying an intent towards violence which needs substantial evidence.  Both checks agree that the image alone does not prove the caption's claim.  The high confidence score (10) from the internal check reflects the correct identification of Black Lives Matter in the image; however, this does not address the crucial claim about the intended use of the buses.  The low confidence score (4) from the external check, which focuses on the verifiability of the claim regarding the buses and riots, is crucial because it points to the lack of substantial evidence backing this part of the caption. The conflict arises from the internal check focusing on the visual identification of entities while the external check critically assesses the claim in its entirety, showing a misalignment between visual observation and verifiable claim.\n\nThe key discrepancy lies in the scope of verification: internal verification is limited to image analysis (entity recognition and alignment), while external verification encompasses the broader claim. To accurately assess the caption, we must consider both perspectives.  The image alone cannot corroborate the claim of buses being purchased for transporting people to riots. While Black Lives Matter's use of buses for transportation to protests is plausible, linking this directly to an intent to participate in riots is an unsupported assertion. The absence of corroborating evidence (news articles, official statements, etc.) weakens the caption's credibility.\n\nIn summary, the statement that these buses were purchased to transport members to riots lacks evidence and is not supported by the image alone. The external check's emphasis on the need for verifiable evidence is far more critical to assessing the truthfulness of the entire caption than the internal check's focus on the image alone.  Therefore, the caption is deemed out of context due to insufficient evidence to support its key claim.  The low confidence score reflects this lack of evidence and the significant limitations of relying solely on the visual aspects of the image in this context.",

Rowling has been known to reveal some shocking secrets from inside the Potter universe. Whether its a characters hidden past, a plot point we may have missed, or a look inside what our favorite witches and wizards are doing today, Rowling has proven time and time again that theres still plenty we dont know about the magical world of Hogwarts. But the authors latest bombshell really takes the cake: J.K. Rowling just announced that Daniel Radcliffe is Chinese.\nWhoa. Mind = blown!\nAs proof, the web site included a series of fake tweets by Rowling, allegedly made on 6 January 2017:\nThe tweets don't appear on the author's authentic Twitter timeline, and according to available biographical information, Radcliffe was born in London, and neither of his parents is of Chinese descent.\nClickHole, like its sister site The Onion, is an openly satirical web site. Here's how ClickHole describes their content on the site's \"About us\" page:\nLets be honest: Today, the average website carelessly churns out hundreds of pieces of pandering, misleading content, most of which tragically fall short of going viral.\nAt ClickHole, we refuse to stand for this. We strive to make sure that all of our content panders to and misleads our readers just enough to make it go viral. You see, we dont think anything on the internet should ever have to settle for mere tens of thousands of pageviews. We believe that each and every article  whether about pop culture, politics, internet trends, or social justice  should be clicked on and shared by hundreds of millions of internet users before they can even comprehend what they just read.\nClickHole has one and only one core belief: All web content deserves to go viral.\nSome of the headlines on ClickHole's front page as of 6 January 2017 included \"Passing The Torch: Watch This Father Give His Daughter His Panini Before Walking Into the Forest Forever\" and \"One Day I Will Understand Basketball (by Jack Nicholson).\"",

Snopes traces the false claim to a satirical website, ClickHole, and provides evidence confirming Radcliffe's British origin and absence of Chinese heritage.

The reason is the lack of independent verification for the caption's claim of the fountain being 'the largest of its kind in the world'. While Dubai's reputation for large-scale projects and the described dimensions of the fountain make the claim plausible, it is not definitively confirmed by the provided information. This discrepancy between the high internal confidence (based on direct image observation) and the moderate external confidence (based on lack of external verification of record) leads to a final verdict of 'Out Of Context'.  The lack of verification for the 'largest in the world' claim is the primary reason for concluding OOC. The image itself perfectly matches the description of a fountain with fireworks at The Pointe, but the claim about its world record size needs external verification which is not provided. There's no conflict in the sense of opposing evidence, but there's a gap in conclusive evidence for a key aspect of the caption. While internally consistent and visually aligned, the absence of external verification for the world-record claim significantly undermines the caption's completeness and hence its accuracy.  The final confidence score of 8 reflects the plausibility of the claim, but emphasizes the lack of definitive proof.  Additional evidence, such as official records or news articles documenting the fountain's record-breaking status, is needed to conclusively support the caption.",

The internal check provides high confidence (10) because the image explicitly shows the CES registration area in Las Vegas, with the \"CES\" logo clearly visible. This aligns perfectly with the caption's mention of CES in Las Vegas. The external check also gives a high confidence score (8), noting that CES is a well-known annual tech event in Las Vegas attracting numerous tech companies.  The slight reduction in the external confidence score is due to the lack of specific year information in the caption; however, the general truth of the statement remains very high.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both confirm that the caption is factually accurate and appropriate for the context of the image.  The high confidence scores from both checks, along with the direct visual evidence in the image, strongly support the caption's accuracy and relevance.  While the caption doesn't explicitly state the year, the context makes the statement highly probable, and the general truth of the matter outweighs the lack of precise time information.  Therefore, the final confidence score is 9, representing very high certainty.  No significant conflicts or uncertainties arose during the validation process.",

It was originally presented as a reproduction of a newspaper editorial harshly critical of those who had voted for Obama in 2008, one supposedly published in \"the Prague newspaper, Prager Zeitungon.\" That mention appeared to be a misspelled reference to Prager Zeitung (\"Prague Newspaper\"), a German-language weekly newspaper from the Czech Republic which is also circulated in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Later versions of this same item attributed that editorial to Vclav Klaus, a Czech politician who served as the first prime minister of an independent Czech Republic from 1993 to 1998 and then as the second President of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013.\nThe attributions of both publication and author were unverifiable, however. The initial version of this item (which was circulated at least as far back as April 2009) provided no contextual information such as a publication date or headline that would facilitate verification of its publication in Prager Zeitung. A search of that newspaper's website at that time pulled up only one article that mentioned Barack Obama, and that article included only an incidental reference about the level of security provided to a U.S. president. No evidence documented that this editorial had been published in either the print or online version of the Prager Zeitung.\nMoreover, not only did no evidence exist showing that Vclav Klaus penned this editorial, it was exceedingly unlikely that he would have written anything like it. Vclav Klaus and Barack Obama appeared to have a reasonably good working relationship while both were in office, and Klaus had not been otherwise been recorded as writing or saying anything (in public or private) nearly so harshly critical of President Obama as the editorial attributed to him here.\nMarcus Hundt, the editor-in-chief of Prager Zeitung, confirmed that the newspaper has never published such an article ... about Joe Biden nor about Barack Obama and that it primarily reports on events in the Czech Republic and Europe and not on domestic affairs in other counties.",

Both the internal and external checks present high confidence scores (10). The external validation strongly supports the caption's accuracy, given the direct confirmation from Snopes, a reputable fact-checking source.  The internal check's 'True' verdict, despite the visual mismatch, is supported by the external check which verifies the main claim of the caption regarding the social media circulation of the text mentioning Joe Biden. While the image itself doesn't depict the Prague newspaper or the circulated text,  the external validation makes up for this limitation, confirming the textual content of the caption through reliable source verification.  The discrepancies between internal and external checks are minor and easily explained. The image focuses solely on Joe Biden; it is not expected to include other elements mentioned in the caption, such as the newspaper article. This discrepancy doesn't negate the fact that the caption's central claim about the online spread of text related to Joe Biden is confirmed by Snopes. Overall, the high confidence scores from both internal and external checks, together with the validation of the caption's central claim from a reputable source, lead to a final assessment of 'False' for OOC (Out Of Context).

However, the external check expresses low confidence (4) primarily due to the implausibility of a turtle intentionally performing such a gesture.  The external check highlights the lack of dexterity and cognitive ability in turtles for this type of intentional action, labeling it anthropomorphic. The discrepancy arises from the subjective interpretation of the image: while the turtle's posture might resemble the gesture, it's highly unlikely to be intentional.  The external check correctly points out that the existence of a photographer and location doesn't validate the specific, highly improbable action.  To resolve this conflict, we must consider the plausibility of the action.  Although the image is consistent with the caption's description, the likelihood of a turtle intentionally \"flipping the bird\" is exceedingly low.  The high internal confidence is based on a visual interpretation, susceptible to bias. While the photo could be real, the caption's interpretation is anthropomorphic and potentially misleading.

While a few odd coincidences exist, Simpsons prediction hoaxes may outnumber actual Simpsons predictions.\nFor example, \"The Simpsons\" did not predict that U.S. President Donald Trump would ride down an escalator while announcing his bid for president; Lady Gaga's Superbowl halftime show; the video game Pokemon Go; the fire at Notre Dame cathedral; a mass shooting during a screening of \"Black Panther\"; Trump's touching a glowing orb; or Trump's death.\nIn August 2019, after Trump mulled the idea of buying Greenland and then announced that he was canceling a trip to the area after Denmark's prime minister rejected the idea, another Simpsons \"prediction\" started to circulate on social media.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a message on Twitter about how the animated show had predicted the kerfuffle.\nMSNBC host Rachel Maddow made a similar joke on Twitter:\nWhile these tweets were likely posted in jest, some people didn't quite get the joke. At least two threads were started on \"The Simpsons\" section of Reddit asking if the prediction was real, and multiple people chimed in on Twitter about the show's uncanny ability to tell the future. Murphy's tweet was also shared on Fark as proof that \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening had a time machine.\nWe searched Frinkiac, a website named after the Simpsons' bumbling mad-scientist character Professor Frink. The site allows fans to search the show's archives for favorite quotes and jokes. And nothing surfaced for mentions of the words \"Greenland,\" \"Trump,\" and \"Denmark\" together.\nFurthermore, we've previously covered the show's \"predictions\" about Trump's presidency. And as far as we can tell, the first mention of a \"President Trump\" came during the season 11 episode, \"Bart to the Future,\" in 2000. Trump was mentioned in prior seasons, but never as president or a potential buyer of Greenland:",

The internal check gives a confidence score of 8 and concludes that while the image depicts a soldier carrying a donkey during a period that visually resembles World War II, there is no visual evidence within the image to explicitly support the claim about landmines.  The external check, with a confidence score of 6, acknowledges the historical context of donkeys used as pack animals during wartime and the prevalence of landmines, making the caption's claim plausible, although not definitively verifiable.  However, the external check highlights the lack of definitive proof and the inherent difficulty in verifying the specific reason for carrying the donkey without further evidence. The discrepancy stems from the internal check focusing solely on visual evidence within the supplied image, while the external check considers broader historical context and circumstantial plausibility.  While the image is consistent with the general setting of World War II and the potential use of animals by soldiers, it fails to offer explicit visual verification for the specific landmine claim. This ambiguity, coupled with the lack of external evidence beyond historical plausibility, leads to the conclusion that the caption is likely out of context. The assertion that the donkey was being carried to avoid landmines is an inference not explicitly supported by the visual data or verifiable external evidence. Therefore, considering the balance of evidence and the lack of strong supporting evidence, a conservative judgment concludes that the caption is likely out of context.

The photograph seen here shows debris resulting from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake (and resulting tsunami) that struck northern Japan in 2011:\nAn aerial view of damage to Wakuya, Japan, after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the area in northern Japan. Ships and aircraft from the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group are conducting search and rescue operations and re-supply missions as directed in support of Operation Tomodachi throughout northern Japan.\nFurthermore, National Geographic reported that while the name \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" may conjure up an image of a floating island of debris, the actual garbage patch itself was actually difficult to see:\nFor many people, the idea of a garbage patch conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics cant always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesnt show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes. The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nThe claim that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers \"8.1 percent of the Pacific Ocean\" is also a matter of debate. The number appeared to come from a 2008 quote from Marcus Eriksen, the research director at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation:\n\"Charles Moore, an American oceanographer who discovered the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\" or \"trash vortex\", believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region. Marcus Eriksen, a research director of the US-based Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which Mr Moore founded, said: \"The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on. It is not quite like that. It is almost like a plastic soup. It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States.\"\nA 2011 study from Oregon State University, however, asserted that the real size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was hundreds of times smaller than commonly claimed:\nThere is a lot of plastic trash floating in the Pacific Ocean, but claims that the \"Great Garbage Patch\" between California and Japan is twice the size of Texas are grossly exaggerated, according to an analysis by an Oregon State University scientist.\nFurther claims that the oceans are filled with more plastic than plankton, and that the patch has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950s are equally misleading, pointed out Angelicque \"Angel\" White, an assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State.\n\"There is no doubt that the amount of plastic in the world's oceans is troubling, but this kind of exaggeration undermines the credibility of scientists,\" White said. \"We have data that allow us to make reasonable estimates; we dont need the hyperbole. Given the observed concentration of plastic in the North Pacific, it is simply inaccurate to state that plastic outweighs plankton, or that we have observed an exponential increase in plastic.\"\nThe studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically \"cohesive\" plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.\n\"The amount of plastic out there isn't trivial,\" White said. \"But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.\"\nBut a study published in 2018 stated the opposite of many of these assertions -- that the Pacific Ocean trash pile was much larger than previously reported and rapidly growing, that most of its bulk was larger objects rather than microplastics, and that about one-fifth of its volume came from the 2011 Japan earthquake referenced above:\nA huge, swirling pile of trash in the Pacific Ocean is growing faster than expected and is now three times the size of France.\nAccording to a three-year study published in Scientific Reports Friday, the mass known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is about 1.6 million square kilometers in size -- up to 16 times bigger than previous estimates.\nGhost nets, or discarded fishing nets, make up almost half the 80,000 metric tons of garbage floating at sea, and researchers believe that around 20% of the total volume of trash is debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.\nThe bulk of the pile is made up of larger objects while only 8% of the mass is microplastics, or pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in size.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Chief Scientist Julia Reisser said in a statement.\n\"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\nWhy the discrepancy? A variety of factors made it difficult to posit an accurate estimate of the debris field's true scope in earlier surveys:\nNo one knows for how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortexs area nearly impossible to measure.",

That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earths surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earths surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earths surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earths surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earths atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earths surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.",

While the internal check finds the caption consistent with the image context (people in Guinea, possible voting slips), assigning a confidence score of 10, the external check demonstrates a lower confidence score of 8 due to the lack of precise date verification of the presidential election. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the caption but highlights the need for additional information (election date) to confirm its accuracy.  Both checks agree that the image depicts individuals in Guinea and the presence of what seems to be voting papers aligns with an election scenario.  The conflict arises from the level of certainty regarding the claim of a specific event on a given date. The image alone cannot definitively prove the occurrence of a particular presidential election on a specific Friday.  The lack of explicit visual evidence demonstrating an election process in progress creates ambiguity.  The image presents individuals in traditional Guinean attire with potential ballot papers. This supports the context of a possible election setting in Guinea but not the date.  External knowledge of Guinean elections provides contextual plausibility but not concrete evidence linking the image directly to the claimed date. The higher confidence score from the internal check is tempered by the lower score from the external check. Considering the crucial need for date verification, the combined confidence score of 8 is more appropriate than 10.

The confidence score of 8 reflects this partial certainty.  The external check emphasizes the high plausibility of the event within the context of the Libyan conflict.  The existence of mass graves and the subsequent exhumation efforts are widely reported realities in Libya's recent history. However, the external check also acknowledges the inability to definitively verify the precise event shown in the image without additional corroborating evidence from news sources or official reports. The lack of specific geographical identifiers (e.g., landmarks, GPS coordinates) in both the image and the caption limits the ability to directly confirm the location as Tarhuna.  The overall assessment weighs the high plausibility of the event in the Libyan context, as supported by external knowledge, with the strong visual correspondence of the image to the caption's description. There is no direct conflict between the internal and external checks, but rather a shared limitation in verifying the exact location. The confidence score remains at 8 because while highly plausible and visually consistent, definitive proof from reliable sources is missing to completely confirm the specifics of the event.

The external check, with a higher confidence score of 8, finds the caption plausible, highlighting the realistic nature of the scenario (dog walking in the Pentlands), the plausibility of the names, and the use of Scottish vernacular.  However, it notes an inability to confirm the caption's accuracy without further verification. The discrepancy arises from the uncertainty surrounding the identities of the woman and the dog.  While the external check finds the names plausible, there is no conclusive evidence from the image to confirm them.  The image, lacking explicit naming, relies on visual inference for entities like \"Bobby McKelvie\" and \"Nettle\".  Therefore, while the scenario depicted is plausible, the specific names mentioned lack definitive confirmation, leading to an \"Out of Context\" assessment.  The confidence score of 6 reflects this uncertainty, lying between the 7 of the internal check and the 8 of the external check, weighted towards the lower score because of the lack of name confirmation.  The \"Out of Context\" determination prioritizes a cautious approach when the information provided is insufficient for definitive validation.

        "explanation": "The original caption claims a chaotic scene in Wuhan involving armed doctors, gunshots, and a woman shot dead for attempting to breach a quarantine roadblock.  Both internal and external validation strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal Validation:\nThe internal check reveals a significant discrepancy. The provided images depict scenes of apparent distress and potential aftermath of an incident, possibly a natural disaster or accident based on the context of people on the ground and a police car seemingly involved in an event. However, there is absolutely no visual evidence of armed doctors, gunshots, or a woman being shot dead. The absence of such crucial elements directly contradicts the caption's central assertion. The confidence score of 3 reflects the certainty of this internal inconsistency.  The images lack context to support the claim of Wuhan as the location, although the presence of Chinese characters on the police car suggests a location in China.\n\nExternal Validation:\nThe external check corroborates the internal findings and strengthens the case against the caption's accuracy. It notes that the described scenario is highly implausible and lacks corroboration from reputable news sources or official reports. The scale of violence described—doctors using lethal force against civilians—is extreme and would have been extensively covered by international media had it occurred.  The lack of any such reports is a significant indicator of the claim's falsity.  The supporting points in the external check methodically dismantle the caption's core narrative by pointing to the absence of credible evidence, highlighting the inconsistencies in the narrative and lack of verifiable details. The external check's confidence score of 2 reflects this lack of supporting information and the high degree of implausibility.  \n\nDiscrepancies and Conflict Analysis:\nThere is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently arrive at the same conclusion: the caption is highly inaccurate and out of context.  Both analyses identify a significant lack of evidence supporting the caption's narrative. The external check adds the crucial layer of demonstrating the implausibility of the claims based on the absence of reporting from credible news sources. \n\nEntity Analysis:\nThe entities mentioned in the caption (armed doctors, gunshots, woman shot dead, Wuhan, quarantine) are not supported by the provided images.  The images show people who appear distressed, possible rescue efforts, and a police car, none of which definitively aligns with the violence described in the caption. \n\nConclusion:\nThe overwhelming evidence from both internal and external checks, coupled with the lack of supporting entities in the images, strongly indicates that the original caption is out of context. The high combined confidence score (9) reflects the high degree of certainty in this assessment.  The claim is not only unsubstantiated but also implausible given the lack of reporting and the absence of any visual evidence.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly reject the caption.  Internal validation finds no visual evidence in the images to support the claim.

        "explanation": "The caption's assertion that the image depicts \"Members of a Youth Pride student group taking part in a rally for gender rights in Bangkok, Thailand\" aligns well with the visual evidence and corroborates external knowledge.  The internal validation check gives a high confidence score of 10 because the image clearly shows a group of young people, many carrying rainbow flags, participating in what looks like a street protest or demonstration.  The flags and clothing indicate support for LGBTQ+ rights and gender equality. The background shows a building, which is consistent with a location in a city such as Bangkok. Thus, the entity alignment is strong, and the content directly supports the description. \n\nThe external validation check also assigns a high confidence score of 8.  The plausibility of such an event stems from the global presence of youth-led activism for gender rights, and specifically, the visibility of LGBTQ+ advocacy in several Asian countries, including Thailand.  Thailand's societal landscape, while not entirely open, exhibits a noticeable LGBTQ+ presence and activism. The existence of a 'Youth Pride student group' is entirely plausible; several such groups exist in many countries with active student movements and LGBTQ+ communities.  Therefore, the caption doesn't contradict any known facts, but the lack of direct external sources limits confidence to a score of 8.  \n\nWhile both internal and external validation support the caption, the absence of specific, verifiable information (such as the date, the name of the specific youth group, or a news report documenting the rally) prevents reaching the maximum confidence score of 10. The external validation score being slightly lower is due to this lack of specific details rather than any inconsistency between the caption and the observed content. \n\nThere are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks.  Both checks strongly suggest the caption is accurate.  The only limitation is the lack of external, corroborating evidence to verify the specific event. The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the visual alignment, provide sufficient evidence to confidently confirm that the caption accurately describes the image's content.",

            "content": "SUEZ, Egypt (AP)  Salvage teams on Monday finally freed the colossal container ship stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal, ending a crisis that had clogged one of the worlds most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.\nA flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of the skyscraper-sized Ever Given from the canals sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged since March 23.\nThe tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule.\nWe pulled it off! said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis, the salvage firm hired to extract the Ever Given. I am excited to announce that our team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated the Ever Given  thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again.\nNavigation in the canal resumed at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT, noon EDT) said Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal Authority, adding that the first ships that were moving carried livestock. From the city of Suez, ships stacked with containers could be seen exiting the canal into the Red Sea.\nAt least 113 of over 420 vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed are expected to cross the canal by Tuesday morning, Rabei added at a news conference.\nAnalysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end.\nThe Ever Given sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, for inspection, said Evergreen Marine Corp., a Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship.\nBuffeted by a sandstorm, the Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That created a massive traffic jam that held up $9 billion a day in global trade and strained supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic.\nRabei said an investigation would determine why the Ever Given got stuck, and he estimated daily losses to the canal of between $12 million to $15 million.\nThe Suez Canal is not guilty of what happened. We are the ones who suffered damage. he said.\nAt least 367 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, had backed up to wait to traverse the canal. Dozens of others have taken the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africas southern tip  a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.\nThe canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Mondays events after days of silence about the blockage.\nEgyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis, he wrote on Facebook, despite the massive technical complexity.\nIn the village of Amer, which overlooks the canal, residents cheered as the vessel moved along. Many scrambled to get a closer look while others mockingly waved goodbye to the departing ship from their fields of clover\nMission accomplished, villager Abdalla Ramadan said. The whole world is relieved.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Cairo tweeted its congratulations to Egypt.\nThe breakthrough followed days of immense effort with an elite salvage team from the Netherlands. Tugboats pushed and pulled to budge the behemoth from the shore, their work buoyed by high tide at dawn Monday that led to the vessels partial refloating. Specialized dredgers dug out the stern and vacuumed sand and mud from beneath the bow.\nThe operation was extremely delicate. While the Ever Given was stuck, the rising and falling tides put stress on the vessel, which is 400 meters (a quarter mile) long, raising concerns it could crack.\nRabei praised the team, saying they achieved a very difficult mission in record time, without damaging the vessel or its cargo.\nBerdowski told Dutch radio station NPO 1 the company had always believed it would be the two powerful tugboats it sent that would free the ship. Mondays strong tide helped push the ship at the top while we pulled at the bottom and luckily it shot free, he said.\nWe were helped enormously by the strong falling tide we had this afternoon. In effect, you have the forces of nature pushing hard with you and they pushed harder than the two sea tugs could pull, Berdowski added.\nThe crew on the tugs was euphoric, but there also was a tense moment when the huge ship was floating free so then you have to get it under control very quickly with the tugs around it so that it doesnt push itself back into the other side of the canal, he said.\nJubilant workers on a tugboat sailing with the Ever Given chanted, Mashhour, No. 1, referring to the dredger that worked around the vessel. The dredger is named for Mashhour Ahmed Mashhour, assigned to run the canal with others when it was nationalized in 1956 by President Gamal Abdel-Nasser.\nOnce the Ever Given is inspected in Great Bitter Lake, officials will decide whether the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship hauling goods from Asia to Europe would continue to its original destination of Rotterdam or head to another port for repairs.\nThe crisis cast a spotlight on the vital trade route that carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the worlds oil. Over 19,000 ships ferrying Chinese-made consumer goods and millions of barrels of oil and liquified natural gas flow through the artery from the Middle East and Asia to Europe and North America.\nThe unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, has prompted new questions about the shipping industry, an on-demand supplier for a world under pressure from the pandemic.\nWeve gone to this fragile, just-in-time shipping that we saw absolutely break down in the beginning of COVID, said Capt. John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com. We used to have big, fat warehouses in all the countries where the factories pulled supplies.  Now these floating ships are the warehouse.\nInternational trade expert Jeffrey Bergstrand predicted only a minor and transitory effect on prices of U.S. imports.\nSince most of the imports blocked over the last week are heading to Europe, U.S. consumers will likely see little effect on prices of U.S. imports, except to the extent that intermediate products of U.S. final goods are made in Europe, said Bergstrand, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dames Mendoza College of Business.\n__\nDeBre reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

But the Washington Post reported that the Suez Canal Authority said the investigation will not focus just on the weather, and that human and technical errors cannot be ruled out.\nThe incident received around-the-clock news coverage by countless media organizations all over the world and efforts to free the ship involved many people and dozens of organizations.\nThe Evergreen Line released updates as the grounding situation unfolded, and on March 25 said it would \"continue to coordinate with the shipowner and Suez Canal Authority to deal with the situation with the utmost urgency, ensuring the resumption of the voyage as soon as possible and to mitigate the effects of the incident.\"\nCrews used tugboats, large-capacity dredgers and high tides to excavate and pull the ship from the canals banks. The vessel was freed by around-the-clock digging (workers removed approximately 30,000 cubic meters of sand) and tugs that pushed and pulled it into the middle of the channel.\nEver Givens owner and insurers could face claims for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage was disrupted, insurers and brokers told Reuters.\nWe rate this post False.",

However, the external check presents conflicting information. It claims that a news source confirms the caption's accuracy, stating that a statue of Melania Trump was unveiled near her hometown in Slovenia. The high confidence score (10) assigned by the external check indicates strong support for this claim. This discrepancy necessitates a closer analysis. Considering the conflicting evidence, we must resolve this discrepancy. The image itself does not provide enough information to verify the identity of the statue or its location. Therefore, we must primarily rely on the external validation. Although the external check offers strong evidence, it is crucial to note that verifying this information requires consulting the cited news source. Without accessing the source directly, we cannot confirm its reliability and the accuracy of its statement. A reasonable approach involves considering the image's direct evidence (lack of Melania Trump's likeness, no location identifiers) and acknowledging the external claim's high confidence without directly verifying the source.  The lack of verifiable supporting information from the news source reduces the overall confidence despite the external check's high score. Given the internal check's correct identification of the image content and the absence of direct verification for the external claim, we must lean towards the internal check's conclusion. While the external check suggests a high confidence, this is contingent on the news source's credibility, which is unknown without accessing it directly.  Based on this analysis, we assess the caption as being out of context.

He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

        "explanation": "The caption claims a boy left his bike chained to a tree in 1914, never returning, and the tree subsequently grew around it. Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute this narrative.  The internal check points out a discrepancy: the image shows a rusty, broken tricycle, not a bicycle, embedded in a tree. This contradicts the caption's description of a complete bicycle left behind in 1914. The condition of the tricycle in the image suggests significantly more prolonged exposure to the elements than would be expected from an object left in place for a relatively short time since 1914. The internal check's low confidence score reflects the inherent uncertainties in assessing the timeframe from a photograph alone. However, the discrepancies between the caption's details and the image's visual evidence raise significant doubts about the caption's accuracy. The external check provides concrete evidence from Snopes.com, which debunks the common narrative associated with this type of image. This debunking explicitly states that the bicycle (or similar object) in such images was not left in 1914 and that the story of the tree growing around it over many years is also usually untrue.  The Snopes investigation suggests that the placement of the bicycle in the tree was likely a deliberate action, not an accidental consequence of abandonment, and points to evidence suggesting the event happened in the mid-1950s rather than 1914.  The external check's higher confidence score underscores the reliability of Snopes' investigation and research.  The strong agreement between the internal and external checks, both pointing towards the inaccuracy of the original caption, leads to a high overall confidence score.  The discrepancies noted above between the caption and the visual evidence, along with Snopes' detailed debunking, demonstrate conclusively that the caption is out of context and significantly misrepresents the events depicted or implied in the image.",

The internal check focuses on the presence and correctness of the named entities in the caption, which are all present and accurately identified in the image.  The strength of this check is that it relies entirely on information directly visible within the image. However, it acknowledges a limitation: the social media discussion mentioned in the caption cannot be confirmed purely from the image content. This limitation lowers the confidence score slightly.\n\nThe external check offers a broader perspective, verifying the plausibility of the caption by assessing its coherence with known events. The external check confirms that the Oprah Winfrey interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on March 7, 2021, was a major news event generating significant social media discussion.  This reinforces the plausibility of the claim that viewers would have commented online about the interview. The lack of specificity regarding \"what Winfrey was wearing\" is noted as a limitation. However, the external check's plausibility assessment is based on the overall context of the interview's reception and the typical online response to such high-profile events. The fact that the interview sparked widespread discussion makes the speculation about Winfrey's attire credible, even without specifics.\n\nThe external check's slightly lower confidence score (8) compared to the internal check's (10) reflects this difference in specificity.  While the internal check validates entities with high confidence, the external check validates the plausibility of the caption's overall claim with slightly less confidence because the precise nature of the claim (what Winfrey was wearing) is unknown.  This is a natural consequence of working with open-ended claims versus direct visual identification.\n\nThere is no significant conflict between the checks. Both checks agree that the core claim – that social media discussion occurred about the interview – is plausible.  They differ only in their level of precision and the scope of their verification. The lack of detail in the caption concerning the specific item Winfrey supposedly wore is not a contradiction; it simply represents a missing detail in the caption rather than a factual inaccuracy.\n\nOverall, considering the evidence from both checks, the caption is deemed accurate with a high level of confidence.  The confidence score of 9 reflects the high agreement between the checks while acknowledging the lower precision of the external verification, which is based on broader contextual information about the events surrounding the interview rather than on direct visual verification of the specific claim.",

The internal check validates the presence of correctly identified entities, while the external check validates the plausibility of the overall claim in light of the highly publicized nature of the interview.

Internal validation gives high confidence (score 10) because the image shows two riders on horses on a beach with hills in the background. The location details (Seamill beach and Arran's hills) are geographically plausible, making this internally consistent.  External validation provides supporting evidence (score 8). Seamill beach and Arran's hills are verified as real locations, increasing the likelihood of the caption's accuracy. Although Ginny Mann's identity as the photographer cannot be independently verified, the absence of this information is not contradictory. The high confidence scores from both internal (10) and external (8) checks strongly suggest that the caption accurately describes the image content and context. The slight difference in confidence scores arises from the inherent limitations of external validation; we cannot definitively verify the photographer's identity without further information. However, this does not diminish the strong positive evidence supporting the caption's accuracy.  There are no significant discrepancies between internal and external checks; both support the claim.

This is based on the understanding that farming is very labor intensive and often requires work 7 days a week. However, the external check also points out that this is an overgeneralization. The amount of rest a farmer gets varies widely based on many factors. The conflict arises from the internal check's inability to assess entity alignment because of the caption's generality.

        "explanation": "The original caption claims that \"Patriots whupped this Antifa turd burglar in Seattle, duct taped him to a trash bin and stuck a dildo on his forehead...\"  Both the internal and external checks independently assess this caption as false and out of context.  Let's analyze each check in detail:\n\nInternal Check:\nThe internal check displays a confidence score of 6 and correctly identifies a significant mismatch between the image and the caption.  The image shows a person duct-taped to a box, which aligns with a portion of the caption. However, the caption adds inflammatory details not present in the image:  the label \"Antifa turd burglar\", and the presence of a dildo. These elements are crucial discrepancies. The image provides no evidence to support these claims.  The internal check reasonably flags the unsupported assertion about the person's affiliation with \"Antifa\" and the lack of visual evidence for the dildo. While Seattle is not explicitly confirmed, the urban setting is not incompatible with Seattle. The internal check's assessment is logical and well-reasoned.\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check reinforces the internal assessment with a confidence score of 2.  This check highlights the lack of verifiable information in the original caption. The claim involves serious allegations of violence, which would usually require concrete evidence like timestamped videos, police reports, or verifiable witness testimonies.  The caption lacks these crucial details.  Furthermore, the language employed in the caption is highly inflammatory and suggestive of partisan bias. Terms such as \"Patriots\" and \"Antifa turd burglar\" are emotionally charged and tend to fuel rather than inform.  The external check correctly points out the high probability of exaggeration or fabrication.  The absence of corroboration from trustworthy sources, like official news reports, further strengthens the case against the claim.  The external check's emphasis on the lack of verifiable information is particularly important.  Without such evidence, claims of violence should be treated with extreme skepticism.\n\nDiscrepancies and Conflicts:\nThere are no major discrepancies or direct conflicts between the internal and external checks.  Both checks independently arrive at the same conclusion:  the caption is false and out of context.  The internal check focuses on the visual mismatch between the image and the caption's details, while the external check focuses on the lack of verifiable external evidence.  Both lines of reasoning strengthen the overall assessment.\n\nEntity Analysis:\nEntity analysis supports the conclusion.  The image displays a person taped to a box. This is a factual observation.  However, the additional entities in the caption (\"Patriots,\" \"Antifa turd burglar,\" \"dildo\") lack visual support within the image.  The absence of such visual evidence underscores the caption's inaccuracies.\n\nConfidence Score Justification:\nThe combined evidence from the internal and external checks, along with entity analysis, strongly suggests that the caption is entirely out of context.  The confidence score of 8 reflects this high level of certainty. While an absolute certainty is rarely achievable in such scenarios, the available evidence overwhelmingly points towards the caption being a false and misleading representation of the image.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on both internal and external checks, as well as a thorough analysis of the image and caption content, it is concluded that the caption is out of context and unreliable. The absence of verifiable evidence, coupled with inflammatory language and the presence of unsubstantiated claims, renders the caption's narrative extremely improbable. A high degree of confidence (8 out of 10) is warranted in rejecting the original caption as a truthful and accurate description of the provided image.",

Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

The man shown in the meme was born without arms and is not a veteran. Trump himself amplified the incorrect, debunked claim on Twitter.\nFull Story\nPresident Donald Trump can be seen in a viral image touching the face of a supporter with prosthetic arms  a moment that occurred during a campaign rally in early 2016.\nA purported story attached to that image, however, is incorrect.\nRadio personality Mark Simone, a Trump supporter, tweeted the photo on Sept. 4, claiming, I remember when President Trump met a veteran wounded so badly that he had no arms. The President reached out and touched his face so he would feel the human contact.\nThat story is wrong  and while Simone has shared it since 2017, fact checkers at Snopes debunked it a year ago.\nSimones recent tweet was then retweeted by Trump, who thanked Simone, and has been turned into a meme condemning the media that has been widely viewed on Instagram accounts such as republicansmovement and donaldtrump_2020.\nThe claim is being shared anew in the aftermath of a story in The Atlantic that quoted unnamed sources alleging that Trump made disparaging comments about wounded veterans and fallen soldiers. Other outlets have also reported corroborating parts of The Atlantics story, but Trump has denied the claims.\nSimone in a Facebook post, sharing the photo of Trump greeting the supporter, urged his followers not to fall for the Atlantic Magazine hoax.\nA reverse image search of the photo in question brought us to 2016 stories referring to a Trump campaign video about veterans that used the image.\nIt was actually taken at a rally at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina  and it shows Trump interacting with a supporter, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr.\nThe Chester News & Reporter published photos and an account of the meeting  during which Trump signed one of Stevensons prosthetic arms.\nChester News & Reporter, Jan. 19, 2016: Stevenson said Trump came over to him after his speech, asked how he was doing and how he got injured. He told Trump that he was born without arms.\nTrump signed Stevensons arm, a sign and his hat.\nIt is my first tattoo on my arm, Stevenson joked.\nLocal news reports in 2014 had covered an online fundraising campaign by Stevensons family to collect donations in order to buy a bionic arm. He and his mother relayed then, too, that he was born in 1991 without arms.\nNone of the stories reported on military service.\nWe reached out to Stevenson, but didnt hear back.\nEditors note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "explanation": "The internal validation check assesses the caption's accuracy based solely on the image's visual content. It finds the caption to be accurate because the image shows Donald Trump interacting with a person who appears to have prosthetic arms, aligning with the caption's description of a 'wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms'. The internal check does not consider external information or the man's actual background.  The external validation check, however, contradicts this assessment. It uses two external sources to verify the caption's claim. These sources confirm the authenticity of the photograph but strongly refute the caption's core assertion: that the man is a wounded veteran who lost his arms. Instead, the sources explicitly state that the man was born without arms and is not a veteran.  Both sources provide significant supporting evidence to contradict the caption. The high confidence scores (10) from both internal and external checks highlight a significant discrepancy.  The internal check's high confidence stems from a purely visual analysis, while the external check's high confidence rests on explicit statements and evidence from two reputable sources.  There is a major conflict between the two assessments.  The external validation findings directly challenge the internal assessment's interpretation.  This conflict is resolved by prioritizing external validation, especially considering its strong support. Relying solely on the visual aspect of the image is insufficient to validate the caption, as the underlying facts of the situation (which the man in the photo was born without arms and was not a veteran) were not visible in the image.  Therefore, the conclusion is that the caption is out of context because it misrepresents the true identity and background of the man in the photograph. Given that both checks had a high confidence score, the final confidence in the OOC assessment is also high (10).",

External validation, however, using two sources, definitively proved the caption to be false; the man was born without arms and is not a veteran.

The image only proves the presence of an Apple store in a location consistent with Hong Kong.  The claim about the trade war's impact is plausible but remains unverified by the image itself.

This directly supports the caption's description of a man chasing a swarm of locusts.\n\nInternal validation shows high confidence (score of 10) because the image strongly suggests the described scenario.

Desert locust swarms are a known phenomenon in East Africa, particularly in Kenya, with Samburu County being a region susceptible to such outbreaks.  The date, May 21, 2020, fits within periods of historical locust swarm activity.  While there's no independent verification of this specific event, the geographical and temporal context make the claim highly likely.\n\nThere is no significant conflict between the internal and external checks.

Both checks highlight the need for external verification to confirm the presence of the described sculpture at Castello di Vezio (the corrected name). The slight discrepancy in the castle's name between the caption and external knowledge is minor.  The high confidence scores (8 out of 10 for both checks) stem from the plausibility of the core elements: plaster sculptures exist; Castello di Vezio is a real castle in a location consistent with the image; and the image shows a sculpture that appears to be made of plaster. However, the lack of definitive proof regarding the specific sculpture's presence at Castello di Vezio necessitates caution.  A conservative estimate of confidence is warranted given the lack of complete evidence. While not definitively proven, it is highly probable based on the available evidence that the caption is largely correct, barring the minor misspelling and the absence of absolute confirmation about the particular sculpture depicted in the image.  The explanation accounts for the reasonable doubt arising from the lack of conclusive external verification regarding the precise sculpture's presence at Castello di Vezio. Therefore, while the caption is likely to be accurate, the lack of absolute certainty results in a confidence score of 8 instead of a higher value.

The high confidence score of 10 from the external check stems from Snopes's thorough investigation and direct refutation of the caption's narrative. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently arrive at the same conclusion: the caption is completely inaccurate and misleading.  The external evidence significantly strengthens the assessment, given the credibility of the source (Snopes). Therefore, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is highly certain, reflected in the confidence score of 10.  In summary, the available evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the image and caption are unrelated, and the caption is a fabrication.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation methods strongly indicate that the original caption is out of context. The internal analysis finds no visual evidence to support the caption, while the external check cites Snopes's fact-check, which refutes the claim and identifies it as a false and Islamophobic rumor.  There is complete agreement between the two validation methods, leading to a high confidence score."

Rather, it was a \"3D visualization\" of the Australian fires by Anthony Hearsey, \"an image maker who specialises in photography, retouching and creative imaging,\" which was compiled from NASA satellite data collected across the span of a month.\nMany postings of this image included a disclaimer noting that the visualization encompassed \"all the areas which have been affected\" by fires in Australia, but that \"not all the areas are still burning\":\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/9oiePhO\nAnthony Hearsey himself offered a clarification of what this image represents:\nThis is a 3D visualisation of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as prettier looking graph.\nThis is made from data from NASAs FIRMS (Satellite data regarding fires) between 05/12/19 - 05/01/20.

This discrepancy necessitates a reevaluation. Entity alignment is strong internally, with the image clearly showing bushfires in Australia.  The external validation's explicit statement that the image is \"a 3D visualization of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO\" directly refutes the caption's claim of a photograph from the ISS.  There's no ambiguity; the external source provides definitive proof that the caption's description of the image's origin and nature is incorrect.  Given the high confidence scores from both checks (10/10), and the direct contradiction on the image's nature and source, we must conclude that the caption is out of context. The weight of evidence firmly supports the external validation's conclusion that the caption is inaccurate.  No additional information is needed; the discrepancy is clearly resolved by the external validation's definitive statement. The external evidence definitively proves the caption is false.

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  Donald Trumps inaugural committee spent more than $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the nations capital as part of a scheme to grossly overpay for party space and enrich the presidents own family in the process, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\nThe District of Columbias attorney general, Karl Racine, said the committee misused nonprofit funds and coordinated with the hotels management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. He said one of the events planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, the presidents daughter Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates, a top campaign official at the time.\nDistrict law requires nonprofits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies, Racine said. In this case, we are seeking to recover the nonprofit funds that were improperly funneled directly to the Trump family business.\nIt was the latest allegation that Trump and his family have used public and nonprofit funds spent at Trump-owned properties to enrich themselves  part of the peril of Trump not fully withdrawing from his businesses while he is president. Trump has maintained ownership but turned the reins over to his adult sons, who have bristled at the charge that they are profiting off their fathers presidency.\nThe committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trumps inauguration in January 2017. But the committees spending has drawn mounting scrutiny.\nThe inaugural committee said Wednesday that it cooperated with the investigation and that Racines office hadnt contacted its lawyers to interview any employees. A spokesman for the committee also said the group had not been contacted by the attorney generals office since last summer and suggested the timing of the suit was politically motivated, as the Senate impeachment trial of the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress was underway.\nThe facts will show that the PIC operated in compliance with the law and this suit is without merit. In fact, it reads more like a partisan press release than a legal filing, according to a committee statement.\nProsecutors found that Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who flipped on the president during the special counsels Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms. In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was a bit worried about the optics of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said.\nStephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump who played a leading role organizing the inaugural parties, had also told Trump, when he was president-elect, and Ivanka Trump that she was uneasy with the offer, Racine said. Winston Wolkoff later followed up with an email to Gates and Ivanka Trump warning that the hotels proposal was at least twice the market rate, Racine said.\nBut Gates went through with it anyway, at a cost of $1.03 million, the suit says.\nProsecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didnt consider those options.\nGates pleaded guilty to charges tied to his lucrative political consulting work in Ukraine and was sentenced last month to 45 days in prison, a punishment that a judge said reflected the extensive cooperation Gates had provided to the Justice Department. Racines office said investigators did not directly speak with Gates in as they pursued the suit.\nA lawyer who represented Gates for the criminal proceedings didnt immediately return a message seeking comment. The White House didnt immediately return a message nor did the Trump Organization.\nThe suit contends that the hotel went against industry practice and refused to discount the space, and double-booked its largest ballroom with a different organization that was still affiliated with the inauguration, the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast. Both organizations were nonprofits, but the breakfast paid $5,000 for the ballroom. The committee, however, paid $175,000, the suit claims.\nProsecutors say the committee also used nonprofit funds to throw a private party on Jan. 20 2017, the night of the inauguration, for Trumps family  a $300,000 affair. The reception was for three of Trumps children  Donald, Jr., Ivanka and Eric.\nThere will be an after party at the OPO (Trump Hotel) following the inaugural balls on Friday. DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric, Gates wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump, according to the suit. DJT is a reference to Donald J. Trump.\nEvent staff within the inaugural committee recognized this would not be a proper use of committee funds and had tried to cancel this event, according to the suit, but Gates and the Trump family went ahead anyway.\nRacine said his office focused on the inaugural committee and the companies that profited because investigators believe thats the best option for them to possibly recover the funds.\nRacine had been sending subpoenas for months related to the investigation. The inaugural committee was also being investigated by New York and state authorities in New Jersey, who are looking into, among other things, whether foreigners illegally contributed to the inaugural events.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the inauguration was held on Jan. 20, 2017.",

The image only provides evidence that Trump is present; it does not offer support for the subjective assessment of his leadership.

The external check's lower confidence stems from the difficulty of objectively verifying the subjective claim about his leadership style and its effectiveness.

Considering that the caption's core claim relies on information not visually present in the image (the Daily Mail report and fan reaction), and that the external check provides a more comprehensive assessment encompassing the verifiability challenges, the final confidence score leans toward the more conservative evaluation of 7.  The external validation process correctly identifies that the date and the volume of fan reactions would need additional evidence from reliable news archives and social media analytics to fully verify the claim.

The external check considers scenarios (like a temporary snow sculpture) that are consistent with the photo but need verification.  Both checks strongly suggest the caption is not out of context. The lack of conflicting evidence between checks and the high degree of internal consistency allow us to place a high confidence score, despite the minor qualification by the external check.  In summary, the image strongly suggests a child viewing a large snowman in a snowy park, and the caption reflects that scene accurately.

Both internal and external checks support the plausibility of this caption. The internal check notes the image depicts a young man performing acrobatics. The presence of palm trees and a sunny sky suggests a warm climate, consistent with the location mentioned in the caption.  However, the image lacks direct confirmation of the location as a suburb of Cairo.  The lack of identifying markers or specific architectural elements limits the internal check's certainty. The external check validates the general plausibility of the caption. Open-air gyms exist worldwide. Acrobatic skills are practiced globally. Cairo is a major city with suburbs.  The external check, while acknowledging that the statement is plausible, does not provide definitive proof the event occurred in a Cairo suburb. The uncertainty stems from the lack of verifiable information linking the image's context to the specific time and place. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks. Both checks highlight the lack of direct proof of location, contributing to a slightly reduced confidence score. However, both confirm the image content's overall alignment with the caption's description.  Overall, the combination of reasonable internal consistency regarding the man's activity and the external check's confirmation of plausible location details suggests a high likelihood of the caption accurately representing the context, despite the lack of definitive visual location markers.

            "content": "Claim:\nU.S. President Joe Biden \"dismissed\" or \"excused\" China's atrocities against its Uyghur population as the result of \"different norms.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2021, some news outlets accused U.S. President Joe Biden of making \"horrific excuses\" for China's atrocities against its Uyghur population.\nFor example, a New York Post headline dated Feb. 17, 2021, reported, \"Biden dismisses Uighur genocide as part of Chinas 'different norms.'\" The Post reported:\n\"President Biden is dismissing the genocide against the Uighur population in China, dubbing the mass internment a 'different norm'  despite the State Department this month responding to atrocities in the camps, following reports of systemic rape and torture.\"\nThe Post's editors followed this story up with an editorial claiming Biden had made \"horrific excuses\" for the Chinese government's human rights abuses.\nThis characterization of Biden's comments during the CNN town hall was misleading.\nThe remark in question came during a Feb. 16, 2021, presidential town hall held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. During the town hall, Cooper asked Biden whether he had brought up the Chinese government's human rights abuses, namely against its Uyghur population, in his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nBiden didn't say that cultural differences are a justification for China's atrocities against Uyghurs  instead, his meaning appeared to be the opposite of that. Biden stated that Xi implicitly understood he or any U.S. president would be expected to take a position against human rights abuses by the Chinese government. Here is a transcript of full the exchange between Cooper and Biden, with the key portion bolded:\nMR. COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: We must speak up for human rights. Its who we are. We cant  my comment to him was  and I know him well, and he knows me well. Were  a two-hour conversation.\nMR. COOPER: You talked about this to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I talked about this, too. And thats not so much refugee, but I talked about  I said  look, you know, Chinese leaders  if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been  the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they havent been unified at home. So the central  to vastly overstate it  the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.\nI point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea Im not going to speak out against what hes doing in Hong Kong, what hes doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful  I said  and by the  he said he  he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they  their leaders  are expected to follow.\nLater Biden indicated that Xi knew that human rights abuses by the Chinese government would result in consequences:\nMR. COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just  is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What Im doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other  other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.\nWe reached out to the White House asking for clarification on Biden's remark.\nKedenard Raymond, director of communications for the National Security Council, wrote in an emailed statement to Snopes that Biden's comment conveyed the expectation that an American president will speak out against human rights abuses:\nPresident Biden has called the oppression of the Uyghurs a genocide, and he stands against it in the strongest possible terms. In that statement, the President was speaking about the need for U.S. Presidents to speak out on universal values, which are deeply held by Americans, and about human dignity everywhere. If you look at the preceding statement, the President stated: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesnt reflect the values of the United States. As he has said publicly and in the initial rounds of calls he has made to leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China, U.S. Presidents are expected to reflect the American norms and values of advocating for human rights.",

While the image correctly depicts Joe Biden, it lacks any visual reference to China, Uyghurs, or the alleged atrocities.  The internal check's confidence score of 8 reflects this partial match, acknowledging that the image alone doesn't fully support the caption's claims. However, the external check plays a more crucial role in determining the caption's accuracy.  The external check, using a Snopes fact-check as a reliable source, found the caption's assertion to be false. The Snopes fact-check provides a comprehensive analysis of Biden's statement, revealing that the caption misrepresents his remarks.  The fact-check shows that while Biden acknowledged differences in norms between the U.S. and China, he did not excuse or dismiss the atrocities against Uyghurs.  The article includes supporting evidence like a transcript of Biden's speech and a clarification from the White House.  Both the transcript and White House clarification directly contradict the caption's statement.  The external check's high confidence score of 8, combined with the detailed supporting evidence from Snopes, strongly suggests that the original caption is inaccurate and misrepresents Biden's words and stance on the Uyghur issue.  The discrepancies between the internal and external checks are significant. The internal check only verifies a visual match of Biden in the image but fails to assess the accuracy of the controversial claim. The external check, on the other hand, directly addresses the core claim, confirming its inaccuracy through a credible source.  This external validation has more weight due to its direct refutation of the claim's central assertion. Therefore, considering both the partial visual match (internal check) and the conclusive refutation of the claim (external check), the caption is deemed out of context. The high confidence scores from both checks reinforce this conclusion, especially the external check's detailed evidence. The final assessment prioritizes the external check's thorough analysis and verifiable evidence, resulting in a high confidence score of 9.",

The mega-retailer will double in size and has already begun the liquidation process of Ulta products. To date, 18 of the 950 Ulta stores have already closed. The remaining stores will close by the end of the year.\nSome of you may be sad to see your local Ulta Beauty close down, but the rest of you are probably wondering:\"Will this benefit me in any way?\" The answer to that question is absolutely \"YES!\" On top of the final blowout sales that are going to be held at each of the closing locations, Ulta Beauty cosmetics department is offering FREE SAMPLES of their skin care products..\nThe scam advertisement then claimed that Ulta carries a secret product reserved only for celebrities and other high rollers, but now accessible to all due to the (nonexistent) liquidation of their products thanks to the (nonexistent) buyout:\nUntil recently, Ulta Beauty has always kept an amazing wrinkle secret called Vlamorous Cream reserved for their high paying celebrity clients. They reported that in order to clear the products off the shelves, they needed to give out free samples for everyone to try. As a result, a few weeks ago they shared the simple solution previously only shared with celeb clients to everyone!\nVisitors to the fake People site were greeted by a landing page that resembles the magazine's digital counterpart, complete with invitations to subscribe and a portal to other magazine titles. Clicking the links to other magazines leads to more scam sales pages:\nAttempts to close the page causes a window to pop up with information about a \"free trial\" with dwindling supplies.

It finds strong alignment, noting the presence of a man getting a haircut in a barbershop. While the image doesn't explicitly confirm the location as Miami, Florida, the caption's claim is not contradicted by the image content.  The internal check assigns a high confidence score of 10. The external check considers real-world knowledge and context. It acknowledges the historical reality of COVID-19 lockdowns impacting businesses like barber shops. The reopening of such businesses after lockdown easing is a plausible scenario, fitting the caption's description.  While external verification cannot confirm the exact date and location, the overall scenario aligns with known events.  This results in a confidence score of 8.  Both internal and external validation support the caption's accuracy, though external validation acknowledges some inherent limitations in verifying the precise location and date. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) strongly support the caption's alignment with the visual context.  There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks.

The internal check highlights the presence of a sign mentioning Fayulu within a protest setting in Kinshasa, which aligns with the caption's description.  While the image alone cannot confirm the exact date or that all participants unequivocally support Fayulu, the context strongly suggests a protest related to him and the contested 2019 election. The external check corroborates this by confirming the historical context of the 2019 DRC presidential election, Martin Fayulu's role as an opposition candidate, and the occurrence of protests following the disputed results.  The lower confidence score reflects the limitation in precisely verifying the specific date (January 11, 2019) and the absolute certainty that every single individual in the image is a Fayulu supporter. The evidence strongly suggests the image is consistent with the caption's description, although there's room for minor uncertainties around the granular details.  There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both support the overall claim, but their individual confidence is reduced due to the impossibility of achieving absolute certainty without direct evidence linking the image definitively to the specified date and the precise political affiliations of each individual in the photograph.

The low confidence score from the external check significantly outweighs the internal check's higher confidence, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context.

        "explanation": "The caption \"This phone box on the Ardnamurchan peninsula looked a bit lonely.\" is validated as not being out of context based on a comprehensive analysis of internal and external checks.  Both the internal and external validation processes yielded positive results, indicating a high degree of confidence in the caption's accuracy. The internal check, with a confidence score of 10, strongly supports the caption's alignment with the image content. The image clearly depicts a red telephone box in a rural, sparsely populated landscape, consistent with the description. The mention of the Ardnamurchan peninsula is also factually correct, providing geographical context to the image. The subjective description of the phone box as 'lonely' does not detract from the overall factual accuracy of the caption; it adds a descriptive element reflecting the visual impression of the scene. \n\nThe external check, while slightly lower in confidence (score of 8), still corroborates the caption's plausibility.  The justification focuses on several key points: the existence of phone boxes in remote areas, the accurate identification of the Ardnamurchan peninsula as a remote location, and the understanding that subjective descriptors like 'lonely' do not inherently impact factual correctness.  This external validation reinforces the internal assessment and strengthens the overall confidence level.\n\nThe slight difference in confidence scores (10 vs. 8) is likely attributed to the difference in the validation methodologies. The internal check directly compared the image content with the caption, providing a direct and detailed assessment. The external check, however, relied on general knowledge and inferences about the location and the common occurrence of similar scenes. Despite this minor discrepancy, both methods independently support the caption's validity.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both conclude that the caption is accurately descriptive and not out of context. The high confidence scores from both (especially the perfect score from the internal check) greatly outweigh any minor uncertainty related to the subjective description.\n\nTherefore, based on the robust evidence from both internal and external validation, the conclusion that the caption accurately represents the image's content and is not out of context is highly confident.  The minor difference in confidence scores doesn't diminish the overall assessment. The consistent positive results make it highly probable that the caption accurately describes the image.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy and contextual relevance. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) point to a strong alignment between the caption and the image content. No significant discrepancies were detected."

While the activity depicted (skydiving near the pyramids) is plausible, requiring verification via external sources like news reports or photographic evidence from that particular Sunday strengthens the assessment. The slight difference in confidence scores between internal (10) and external (8) checks is due to the external check's more cautious approach in verifying the specific date. Both checks agree on the overall context of the image—skydivers over the Giza pyramids. There are no major discrepancies; the minor difference is due to the level of verification possible.

The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the visual evidence from the image, strongly support the caption's accuracy despite the minor time discrepancy. Therefore, I conclude that the caption is not out of context. The slight difference in the year mentioned is not substantial enough to deem the caption completely inaccurate.

The conflict arises because the caption asserts that the image is a recruitment flyer, while the image itself shows an artistic piece unrelated to recruitment.  The external evidence validates the existence of such flyers but not the image's authenticity as one of them.

The internal check provides a conclusive assessment of the image's content. The discrepancy arises from the caption misrepresenting the image's nature. The entity alignment is poor because the image content (a graffiti artwork) doesn't align with the caption's claim (a recruitment flyer).

Internal consistency checks reveal a moderate alignment between the caption and the image. The image depicts Indonesian villagers with what seems to be a deceased woman. However, the image does not directly support the claim of resurrection. The caption's mention of Indonesian villagers aligns with the visual content, yielding a confidence score of 8. However, external validation casts serious doubt on the caption's claim.  The assertion that a woman was revived after three years is highly improbable based on scientific understanding of human death, where death is typically considered irreversible after vital functions cease.  While cultural practices exist around death and resurrection, those are often symbolic or spiritual, not literal revivals. The external check highlights the implausibility of the claim, lacking strong supporting evidence and achieving a confidence score of 1.  The conflict between the internal and external checks arises due to the ambiguity of the image. While the image depicts a scene possibly consistent with a ritual, it does not visually confirm the claim of resurrection. The lack of verifiable evidence from reputable sources significantly undermines the original caption's claim. Therefore,  considering the low confidence score from external validation and the absence of definitive proof within the image, the caption is deemed out of context. The low confidence score of 2 reflects the significant uncertainty and implausibility associated with the claim.",

The external check has a higher confidence score (confidence_score: 8) as it acknowledges the plausibility of such a tunnel and the return to normalcy after restrictions, but lacks specific details for high confidence.  The discrepancy lies in the level of detail required for verification. The internal check requires visual confirmation of the specific location mentioned in the caption. The external check acknowledges the plausibility based on general knowledge and trends, which is less stringent. To resolve this conflict, we lean toward the more conservative internal check, which requires explicit visual evidence.  The caption mentions specific geographical locations (Shanghai and Huangpu River) and specific claims (sightseeing tunnel) that are not clearly present in the picture itself. Although the external check suggests that the overall scenario is realistic, the absence of direct visual confirmation in the image makes it difficult to confidently affirm the accuracy of the caption. Therefore, the final judgment is that the caption is Out Of Context, with a confidence score reflecting the uncertainty caused by the conflicting results and the lack of specific visual evidence within the image. The details provided in the caption could well be true, but the image alone does not sufficiently support them.  A more accurate caption should only refer to the elements directly visible in the image (e.g., 'People riding a subway train through a brightly-lit tunnel'). Adding the additional details would require additional supporting information, such as a map, a news report, or similar evidence, which is not provided in this context.",

The file contains photos of a group of people dissected a corspe in an open field. For your perusal, I would like to send herewith the facts regarding the abovementioned photos as follows:\nThe photos were taken on 13 March 2009 at a cemetery in a southwestern province of Thailand (Prachaub Khiri Khan Province). For people who practice Buddhism in Thailand, there are two religious rituals to honour the deceased: the first is to cremate the body, and the second is to bury the body. For Buddhists in Thailand, the burial of the deceased is not as widely-practiced as cremation. Buddhists are normally buried rather than cremated when they have no relatives, or when their relatives cannot afford to pay for the cremation.\nCemeteries in rural provinces in Thailand often run out of space as a result of too many bodies being buried in limited amount of land. So the Buddhists in Thailand practice a religious tradition called \"Lang Pa Cha\" (which means \"the cleaning and tidying of the cemetery\"), where volunteers will dig up bodies that were unclaimed by any relatives and cremate them to honour their spirits in accordance with the Buddhist religious rites. Such a ritual is considered to be a good deed and a merit-making process.\nAt every \"Lang Pa Cha\" religious ritual, a large number of unclaimed bodies is always found. (In the case of the photos taken here, 64 unclaimed bodies were found.) To cremate a whole body takes a long time, so only the bones of the unclaimed bodies are cremated. Thus the reason for the dissection of the flesh from the bodies as you have seen in the photos.\nThe volunteers in this ritual are mostly medical staff or emergency response crews who are the first unit to arrive at accident scenes to save lives (easily identifiable by their blue-and-white uniforms and ID cards). They are used to seeing dead bodies, and that is why they look nonchalant in the photos.\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, the volunteers who participate in this religious ritual must be on a strictly vegetarian diet in order to cleanse their minds both before and after the ritual. The images of the volunteers cooking and having their lunch just show the preparation of a normal vegetarian lunch and have no connection to the deceased body or the dissected flesh.\nThe circulation of the images is thus an ill-intended attempt meant to mislead the public into believing that one race of human will commit genocide or inhuman acts against another and thus create fear and hatred. The deceased body shown in the photos is a Thai male with a dark complexion (which had been even darker after his death), not an African male.\nI hope this email provides you with factual information regarding this ill-intended document and photos.",

The external check, however, shows high confidence (score 10) supporting the caption's claim by citing a source explicitly stating that the photographs depict people in Thailand carving up and consuming a human body. This discrepancy highlights a significant conflict. The external source's high confidence relies solely on its own assertion, without providing further details or corroborating evidence to validate the claim.  The internal check, grounded in visual analysis of the provided image, points towards a lack of visual proof for the caption's assertions.  Because the external validation's confidence is based on an unverified source, it is given less weight than the internal check's more conservative assessment based on direct image analysis.  Therefore, given the lack of visual evidence in the image itself and the reliance of the external source on its own statement without additional verification, I conclude the caption is out of context.  The confidence score is low (4) because of the conflicting evidence, the need for further corroboration from other reliable sources to support the external check's claim, and the absence of visual proof in the image itself to support the caption's description of the events.",

In the days that followed, as preparations were being made for the inauguration of President Joe Biden on Jan. 20, about 20,000 members of the National Guard were deployed to Washington, D.C., to provide security for the event.\nAs Biden's inauguration was underway, a video started circulating on social media that some, such as the conspiratorial InfoWars, claimed showed members of the National Guard intentionally turning their backs on Biden's motorcade as a sign of disrespect.\nThis video does not show members of the National Guard intentionally turning their backs on Biden's motorcade.\nThe claim that these National Guardsmen were turning their backs on Biden's motorcade is based on the presumption that members of the military should, at all times, stand at attention in the presence of the commander-in-chief. But that's not the case. In this video, for instance, these members of the United States military are on duty to protect the president against potential threats. In order to do so, some are facing away from the street, while others are facing toward the motorcade.\nA spokesperson for the National Guard told us: These National Guardsmen were on duty with a mission to protect the president against potential threats. Some are facing out to ensure the safety of all.\nIn other words, this video does not show any disrespectful behavior. The National Guardsmen in this video were simply performing their duties to ensure the safety of everyone in attendance at Biden's inauguration.\nThe claim that this video shows members of the military turning their backs on the president is based on solely on the thirdhand interpretations of social media users. No members of the National Guard have stated that they turned their backs on the motorcade, no credible news outlets have filed such reports, nor has the National Guard released any statements admonishing members of the military for showcasing disrespect for their commander-in-chief.\nIt should also be noted that Biden's motorcade consisted of dozens of vehicles. While we don't have a precise count, the automotive news site The Drive described the motorcade as \"absolutely massive,\" consisting of seven \"Beasts,\" the nickname for the heavily armored presidential limo, to transport Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George Bush. Several other SUVs, limos, and police and military escort vehicles were also in the motorcade.\nAn absolutely massive motorcade took President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, along with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, among others, around the greater Washington, D.C. area after the inauguration today. At one point, at least seven heavily armored and otherwise custom-built presidential limousines, commonly known as \"Beasts,\" together with an armada of other armored SUV limousines and supporting vehicles, took part in the procession.\nLastly, while the vantage point of this video is still a bit unclear, it certainly did not originate from Biden's vehicle. This video was posted by ABC News reporter Ines de La Cuetara, along with the caption: \"The view from Bidens motorcade as it made its way up to the Capitol.\" La Cuetara, who was presumably in a vehicle near the rear of the motorcade  as she is a reporter, not a politician  made no mention of the National Guard turning their backs on Biden.\nHere's the original video:",

It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

Although racist memorabilia with that phrase existed, it was not an official license issued by the state. The external check provides strong evidence that the image shows a piece of racist memorabilia, not an official state document.  The conflict between the high internal confidence and the low external confidence necessitates a closer examination. While the image's text strongly suggests the claim in the caption, the external evidence from a reputable source overwhelmingly contradicts this internal assessment. The external evidence highlights the existence of a racist artifact and its circulation online but debunks the claim in the caption.  Given the weight of evidence and the authoritative nature of the external source, the conclusion that the caption is out of context is strongly supported. The high internal confidence score is mainly due to the clear text on the image, which is misleading due to the nature of the item pictured. The external check, based on a fact-checking analysis, correctly identifies the misrepresentation and provides a more accurate context.",
        "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's alignment with the image content. External check, however, with low confidence (2), reveals that the claim is false based on fact-checking. The external evidence is deemed more reliable due to its source and nature, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context despite the image's apparent content."

            "content": "Claim:\nDonald Trump suggested he'd use nuclear weapons against Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a wall.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 March 2016, Politicalo published an article reporting that Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 election, said he would use nuclear weapons on Mexico if they refused to build and pay for a border wall:\nIn a Donald Trump administration, the U.S. military will be so strong that Mexico wont dare to go to war over the wall Trump wants to build between the two countries. On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall? Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isnt playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials emphatic insistence that theyll never cough up the dough.\nBecause nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that, the billionaire businessman added. We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. Thats how I know theyre bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, Im going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when Im done building it, Im going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteens Born In The USA to them, just for the hell of it. You just dont mess with the U.S., and thats that ... Let me tell you, weve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think thats a pretty definitive message, and thats the hard way. Now, Ive said before that political correctness is whats killing this country, and Im standing by it. However, since Ive never been a warmonger, Im trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, well have no problem. If they dont and they start acting up, well, well just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.\nComments attributed to Trump in the first paragraph were authentic, and came from an MSNBC appearance by the candidate in early March 2016:\nOn MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?\nTrust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexicos not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn't playing with us with war, Trump responded Wednesday.\nOne of Trumps signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials' emphatic insistence that they'll never cough up the dough.\nMexican President Pea Nieto blasted Trump in two separate interviews this week, slamming the billionaire's strident expressions to a Mexico City newspaper and warning that the kind of rhetoric he uses has led to very fateful scenes in the history of humanity.\nThat's the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived, Pea Nieto said. Trump's comments, he told El Universal, have \"hurt the relationship we have sought with the United States.\"\nThe first portion of the article may have led readers to think that the subsequent claims were real, but everything beyond its first paragraph was fabricated. Content published by the self-styled \"hybrid\" news sites Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo built upon controversial current events with related embellishments. Politicalo and related sites featured a button enabling readers to \"Show Facts\" or \"Hide Facts\":\nHowever, every Newslo, Politicalo, and Religionlo item opened in \"Hide Facts\" mode by default, making the embellishments difficult for readers to identify. In addition to its \"Show Facts/Hide Facts\" feature, Politicalo's disclaimer explained:\nNewslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.\nPrevious Newslo, Religionlo, and Politicalo articles that caused social media confusion included claims that Marco Rubio said women should be taken into custody if they were considering an abortion (and that Zika was a punishment from God), Pat Robertson said gay people should wear colors by which heterosexual people could identify them in public, Pastor John Piper said bikini waxes were a sin in the eyes of God, David Bowie was alive but held hostage by Satanic entities, Ted Cruz said God would not have allowed Antonin Scalia to die at a time that was not politically expedient, a Republican lawmaker proposed saliva-based \"hunger tests\" for food stamp recipients, and Bristol Palin said that more black actors weren't nominated for Oscars because they all looked alike.",

The external check supports the caption's accuracy by citing common childhood activities and scenarios that align perfectly with the image's content.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both strongly agree that the caption accurately reflects the image's content.  The higher confidence score from the internal check is justifiable because it directly assesses the visual match, whereas the external check relies on general plausibility and common experience.

This subjective element is precisely captured by the questioning tone in the caption. The external check highlights potential exaggeration in reporting.  This nuance, however, doesn't negate the core statement that Australia experienced significant fires. The difference in confidence scores between internal and external checks (10 vs 8) is minimal and reflects the subjective nature of assessing the intensity of the fires and the potential differences in perspectives. The overall high confidence scores, combined with the fact that both checks support the accuracy of the caption (although with some qualifications regarding the severity), provide strong evidence that the caption is not out of context.  The internal check focuses on the direct visual representation of the fires in the image, while the external check considers the broader context of Australia's fire history and media reporting. These different perspectives complement each other and strengthen the overall conclusion.  Both internal and external checks agree that the core statement aligns with the image, with the difference in confidence scores mainly driven by the subjective assessment of the word \"bad\". The image provides strong evidence of extensive fires; whether this represents an exceptionally 'bad' situation is a matter of further comparison and context. However, this nuance doesn't make the caption out of context, but rather raises the question of the level of severity.",

Although the specific event name isn't visible, the context of a public speaking engagement is evident. The external check also provides strong support (8), noting that Kamala Harris was a U.S. Senator in 2019 and the Center for American Progress is a legitimate organization that would plausibly host such an event. The location, Las Vegas, adds further plausibility. While there's no explicit visual confirmation of the exact event, the lack of contradictory evidence and alignment with known facts about Kamala Harris's career and the Center for American Progress weigh heavily in favor of the caption's accuracy.  The discrepancy between the internal and external confidence scores is minor (2 points), and is likely because the external check acknowledges that a definitive verification of this specific event requires an independent source (e.g., news article), which is not available here. The visual evidence provided, combined with the high plausibility of the described event based on external knowledge, leads to the conclusion that the caption is not out of context.  Both checks identify a high level of confidence, and the minor discrepancy is explainable, with the external check being slightly more conservative due to the lack of an independent verifiable source.\n\nEntity analysis supports the findings. The entities mentioned (Kamala Harris, U.S. Senator, Center for American Progress, National Forum on Wages and Working People, Las Vegas, Nevada, 2019) are all consistent.  No obvious contradictions or mismatches emerge when comparing entities in the image with the caption.  Kamala Harris's public appearances and the Center for American Progress's activities are both verifiable through public records and news archives, enhancing the credibility of the caption.\n\nIn summary, the weight of evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is not out of context. While absolute certainty is impossible without access to primary documentation of the specific event, the combination of strong internal visual evidence and strong external plausibility based on known facts results in a high confidence score of 9.",

This message was wrong on both accounts.\nThe artwork shown above was created by Friedrich Kunath in 2010 for a solo exhibition at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York, making the work not amateur, not the winner of a contest, and not from the Netherlands. Additionally, Kunath's art (which is called \"Tropical Depression\"), has nothing at all to do with Europe or multiculturalism:\nTropical Depression refers to a kind of internal weather system combining melancholy and a sense of hopefulness. Tropical Depression is a lush depression one wallows in and holds in itself a kind of promise and optimism.\n[...]\nEach of the sculptures are a combination of realistic figuration and the surreal. Life scale and wearing the artist's clothes, the sculptures possess an uncanny presence. Each of the sculptures' titles begin with the phrase \"All my problems are water based . . .\" evoking ongoing themes in Kunath's work of homesickness, melancholia, and addiction. The line between nurturing and excess become blurred with images of a man engorging himself on a giant strawberry or watering a tree connected to a noose.\nWhile viewers are free to interpret artwork any way they choose, the artist's original intent was not to represent multiculturalism in Europe.",

The use of \"galore\" suggests a multitude of performances, which is a reasonable interpretation given the vibrant and dynamic nature of the depicted performance. While the specific event is unknown, the general nature of stadiums as venues for various performances makes this caption very plausible. No additional evidence is needed to support this assessment.

This is a valid point based on the image's content alone.  However, the external check assigns a confidence score of 4 and deems the caption as true, acknowledging the figurative nature of the statement. The caption doesn't claim the cat literally has a bass voice; rather, it uses hyperbole to describe a characteristic of the cat's vocalization (a low pitch).  The comparison to Barry White, known for his deep baritone, serves as a humorous exaggeration to highlight this. There is no factual impossibility in a cat possessing a vocal quality that could be described in this manner, although external evidence is needed to definitively confirm the particular cat's vocalization.  The external check correctly recognizes that the claim's truthfulness is not the primary point, but rather the imaginative and figurative expression.\n\nThe conflict arises from the different interpretations of the caption: the internal check focusing solely on the literal absence of Barry White, while the external check considers the caption's figurative and hyperbolic usage. The external validation's score is higher because it evaluates the caption's intent and the possibility of the statement's underlying premise (a cat having a low-pitched vocalization) rather than focusing solely on the literal presence of the mentioned celebrity.  However, because we cannot confirm the cat's vocal characteristics without additional information, the overall confidence score remains low (4 out of 10).  The caption, while not factually verifiable based on the image alone, is not entirely out of context in the sense that it uses figurative language to describe a possible characteristic of a cat.  But due to the lack of supporting evidence for the cat's vocal abilities, we lean towards it being out of context in its claim regarding the comparison to Barry White's voice.",
        "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the caption false due to the absence of Barry White; external check finds it acceptable due to the figurative use of language, yielding a conflict.  The final verdict is OOC due to the unverifiable nature of the core claim and the low overall confidence."

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isnt how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? Its not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didnt have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasnt replaced because a process wasnt codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobarts absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldnt become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but thats for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

It's unclear where this rumor originated. The above-displayed video makes no mention of this person being an FBI agent and when his wallet is pulled out by the police officer it does not show an FBI badge.\nThis rumor may have started with @thisisnike1, the account that originally posted the video.

The external check, with a significantly higher confidence score of 10, provides corroborating evidence from Snopes, which explicitly refutes the caption's claim. Snopes states the video doesn't depict an FBI agent's arrest; instead, it shows an unrelated incident in Rochester, Minnesota, from over a year before the George Floyd protests.  The claim originated as a rumor or miscaptioning.  There is a strong alignment between the internal and external assessments, both concluding that the caption is misleading and inaccurate.

By precooking it and blending it in a special way, he was able to make a fully cooked 100% bacon paste that could be squeezed from a tube. Knowing he had discovered something paradigm-shifting, young Vilhelm Lilleflsk quickly went into business. That, dear friends, is when Squeez Bacon was born. And this delicious delectable from Sweden has finally been brought over to the USA - now with American Flavor!\nBoth Squeez Bacon and Vilhelm Lilleflsk are made-up entities created for ThinkGeek's annual April Fools' Day fake product launch. A November 2009 New York Times Magazine piece referencing Squeez Bacon described that tradition, which began in 2001:\nOn April 1 of each year since 2001, ThinkGeek, the online retailer, has devoted its home page to products that dont exist. The names sound unlikely  Squeez Bacon, Surgestix Inhalable Caffeine Stix, p-Teqs USB Pregnancy Test Kit, etc.  but they are presented as any item on the site would be: catalog description and list of features, pictures, maybe a video, price, Buy Now button. Click that and . . . ThinkGeek wishes you a happy April Fools Day.\nAccording to an April 2, 2009, story on the website Bacon Today, this is the image people attempting to procure Squeez Bacon would have seen had they added the product to their cart:\nDespite the fact that ThinkGeek  a website famous for its fake April Fools' Day products  explicitly stated that the product was not real 12 years ago, there remains confusion online as to the feasibility of buying a tube of Squeez Bacon. A Jan. 30, 2021, Reddit post in the \"Thanks I Hate It\" subreddit brought renewed attention to the fake product.\nUnfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your viewpoint) the product remains fictional.

The external check uses a Snopes article as evidence to determine that \"Squeez Bacon\" is not a real product, but rather a fictional product created as an April Fool's Day joke by ThinkGeek.

There is no significant conflict between the two checks. Both support the assertion that the caption accurately reflects the image content. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8), suggest a strong likelihood that the caption is accurate and not out of context.  The only potential uncertainty arises from the inability to independently verify the identity of Hayley Grant, the person mentioned in the caption. However, this does not invalidate the core information conveyed by the caption, which is the event of a robin being hand-fed mealworms.  The image strongly supports this event. Given the alignment of image content and caption, and the high confidence from both internal and external checks, it is highly probable that the caption accurately reflects the situation depicted. Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is not out of context, and the confidence score reflects this high level of certainty.  There is no need for further investigation to enhance the certainty, unless we sought to independently verify the identity of Hayley Grant, which is outside the scope of the provided information. There is strong support that the event happened (a robin eating mealworms from a hand in Wick, Caithness) regardless of the identity of the person involved.  The plausibility of this event is high, and the image directly corroborates this. The robustness of the information is further reinforced by the consistent results from the internal and external validity checks.

Gates, who has long warned that we are inadequately prepared to deal with global pandemics, has also pledged to make billions of dollars available for funding the manufacture of vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was a member of the Leadership Council for the Gates Foundation's Decade of Vaccines Collaboration effort launched in 2010.\nHowever, the meme jumps the rails at suggesting anything more than that Gates is interested in improving lives through medical research and vaccinations.\nGates does not own a lab in Wuhan, China, in partnership with Soros; that claim is a combination of two separate and false rumors that we have already debunked at length: that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was deliberately engineered as a bioweapon, and that Soros owns the laboratory in Wuhan where the alleged development of the virus supposedly took place.\nThe rumor that \"India is suing Bill Gates because he vaccinated 77,000 third world girls between the ages of 9 & 15 and many of them died\" is also a false one that we have explored at length. This claim is not directly connected to Gates or the Gates Foundation, but rather to the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), which conducted a study beginning in 2009 to see if it could reduce the number of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. (The Gates Foundation was one of PATH's global partners and reportedly provided funding for its HPV study.) The study caused controversy in India when seven of the girls involved in the trial in that country died after receiving their vaccines, but state investigations found those deaths were unrelated to the vaccinations:\nState investigations absolved the trial's managers  PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi  of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was \"very unlikely\" to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as \"unlikely.\" ICMR's director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: \"Based on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,\" he insists.",

The image shows President Obama appearing to give former President George W. Bush \"bunny ears.\"  The caption accurately describes this visual element and identifies the individuals correctly. However, the external check also provides a high confidence score (10) and contradicts the internal check by stating that the image is digitally manipulated and is therefore fake. The external check references a Snopes article, which is a reputable source for fact-checking. The conflict between these two checks requires careful consideration.  The internal check assesses the literal depiction in the image, but the external check provides evidence suggesting that the literal depiction is false. Because we have strong evidence that the image is digitally altered, and thus the visual content of the image is not a true representation of an actual event, we must prioritize the external validation. This is because the external validation examines the authenticity of the image as a whole, while the internal validation focuses on the immediate visual content without considering its potential manipulation. The Snopes article's assertion that the image is fake is a more robust form of validation. The high confidence scores in both internal and external checks further solidify this assessment.  Therefore, the caption is determined to be out of context because it describes a situation shown in a manipulated image that did not actually occur. The discrepancy is resolved by weighing the evidence: a fact-checked source demonstrating the image's falsity overrides a purely visual interpretation.",

However, an external check (Snopes) provides equally high confidence that the image is digitally manipulated and fake.

The internal check highlights a perfect alignment between the image's content (soldiers installing concertina wire near a river in what seems to be a border setting) and the caption's description of the location (US-Mexico border near Laredo, Texas, Rio Grande river). The only minor discrepancy is the absence of a clear view of the Juarez-Lincoln Bridge in the photograph; however, the overall context strongly suggests its proximity given the setting near Laredo and the Rio Grande.  The external check reinforces this by referencing documented border security practices involving the deployment of concertina wire along the US-Mexico border, particularly around 2018.  While the exact date and photograph cannot be independently verified, the deployment of military personnel engaged in this activity is entirely consistent with historical records.  The confidence score of 9 reflects the high degree of agreement between the internal and external checks and accounts for the minor discrepancy regarding the explicit visual confirmation of the bridge's presence. This minor discrepancy does not undermine the overall accuracy of the caption's description. The external validation's supporting points clearly align with the image's content, providing further confidence in the caption's validity.

The external check provides strong supporting points, emphasizing the predatory nature of gannets, their opportunistic feeding habits, and their tendency to steal fish from fishing boats.  The high confidence score (8) of the external check outweighs the lower confidence score (7) of the internal check. While the image doesn't definitively prove the gannets were attempting to raid the boat, the caption's alignment with known gannet behavior and the location makes it a highly plausible scenario. There's no major discrepancy between the checks; the internal check's reservations are addressed and overridden by the external check's compelling evidence.  The internal check's lack of visual confirmation of the location and the absence of a person in the photo are minor limitations; they do not invalidate the overall plausibility of the caption.  The absence of a person is irrelevant; it's the relationship between the gannets and the fishing boat that is the focus of the caption and it is supported by the knowledge of gannet behavior.  The external validation leverages established knowledge and common sense to support the caption. The final assessment thus leans heavily towards accepting the caption's description. Overall, the caption accurately represents the context given the available evidence, making it a believable description of the scene even without explicit visual evidence of the gannet's intentions or the exact location.",

The image depicts a child being properly secured in a car seat with the help of an adult.  There is no mention of backless boosters, nor any reference to a ban in the US starting in December 2016 within the image itself. The internal check correctly identifies this discrepancy, assigning a confidence score of 0 due to the lack of any connection between the caption and the visual content. \n\nThe external check significantly strengthens this assessment.  It provides evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website, that directly debunks the claim made in the caption. Snopes thoroughly investigates the origin and spread of the false claim, demonstrating its inaccurate nature and highlighting its origin as a social media meme. The external check's high confidence score (10) reinforces the internal check's finding.  Snopes details how the claim used metric units, hinting at a non-US origin, and how it was inaccurately reported in some local news sources. Further, the external check points out that even in the UK, where similar legislation was considered, the impact was limited to manufacturers of new products, not affecting existing users of backless boosters.  The external check thoroughly investigates and refutes the caption’s core assertion. \n\nThere is complete agreement between the internal and external checks. Both conclude that the caption is factually incorrect and unrelated to the image. The high confidence score from the external check, supported by the internal check's lack of support for the caption, strongly suggests that the caption is indeed out of context. No discrepancies are found, and the external evidence conclusively shows the caption is false. Therefore, the final assessment is that the caption is out of context with a high level of confidence.",

Although the name \"Forest Lodge Garden Centre\" and the precise location details (\"Farnham, Surrey\") aren't explicitly visible within the image, the scene's overall composition strongly points towards a garden center. The date, \"31 March\", is a valid date, further enhancing the plausibility of the caption. The external validation, while less certain (score 8), supports the plausibility of the caption.  It confirms Farnham, Surrey's existence and the general likelihood of garden centers in such locations.  However, it acknowledges the inability to definitively verify the specific existence of \"Forest Lodge Garden Centre\" without additional information, like a business registry check or a confirmation from a local authority. There is no significant conflict between the internal and external checks.  The higher confidence score from the internal check stems from the visual analysis directly interpreting the image's content as showing a garden center.  The external check's slightly lower confidence reflects the inability to confirm the specific garden center's existence solely based on the provided caption.   Combining both checks, we can reasonably conclude that the caption is likely accurate. The absence of a year in the date specification adds an element of uncertainty, though not significant enough to override the considerable evidence supporting the caption's plausibility.  The lack of explicit confirmation about the garden center's name and the date's year is the primary reason for a slight reduction in the overall confidence score. Given the strong visual agreement (internal) and plausible external contextual validation, there's substantial reason to believe the caption is not out of context.  More information would improve the certainty, but the current evidence is sufficient to suggest a high likelihood of accuracy.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption's plausibility.  Internal check is highly confident based on visual analysis of the image. External check confirms the geographical location's validity but cannot confirm the garden center's specific name without additional information.

The internal check highlights the visual consistency between the image and the caption, with a high confidence score of 10. The external check, while slightly less confident (score of 8), acknowledges the plausibility of the scenario based on the prevalence of military reenactments in South Korea and its rich military history.  The external check's lower confidence score stems from a lack of specific details in the caption, making definitive verification challenging. However, the absence of contradictory evidence, combined with the strong internal validation, strengthens the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy.\n\nDiscrepancies:\nThere is a minor discrepancy in confidence scores between the internal and external checks. The internal check exhibits higher confidence due to the direct visual evidence. The external check, while supportive, highlights the lack of specific event details, leading to a slightly lower confidence score.  This discrepancy is not significant, as both assessments agree on the fundamental accuracy of the caption.\n\nEntity Alignment and Internal Validation:\nThe internal check meticulously examines the alignment between entities depicted in the image and the elements mentioned in the caption. The image clearly shows individuals in what appear to be South Korean military uniforms, consistent with the caption's description of \"South Korean performers dressed as soldiers.\"  The reenactment aspect is also plausible given the setting and the soldiers' activities. The high confidence score reflects this strong visual consistency.\n\nExternal Validation and Uncertainty:\nThe external check introduces a layer of verification beyond the image itself. It considers the broader context of military reenactments in South Korea and assesses the plausibility of the event based on the country's history and culture. The lack of specific details (date, location, event name) introduces an element of uncertainty, hence the slightly lower confidence score.  However, the absence of any information contradicting the caption's claim maintains the overall plausibility of the scenario.\n\nConflict Analysis and Cross-Validation:\nNo significant conflict arises between internal and external checks. Both checks concur that the image shows individuals dressed as South Korean soldiers, likely participating in a reenactment. The difference in confidence scores is primarily due to the level of detail provided. The external check necessitates more concrete information to boost its confidence level. The cross-validation of the visual evidence (internal) with the plausibility assessment (external) solidifies the overall conclusion.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the combined evidence from both internal and external checks, it can be concluded with high confidence that the caption accurately reflects the content of the image.  While the external check acknowledges a level of uncertainty due to a lack of specific details, this uncertainty does not negate the plausibility of the scenario supported by the strong visual evidence. Therefore, the caption is deemed accurate and not out of context.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy, with the internal check showing stronger confidence due to direct visual alignment.  The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the event but points out the lack of specific details for absolute verification."

However, the lack of corroborating evidence, such as a link to the visualization or confirmation of Hearsey's existence and work, limits the external validation's confidence.\n\nDespite the slightly lower confidence score from the external check, the strong internal validation and the plausibility of the information in the external check outweigh the lack of direct corroboration.  The external check's supporting points (Australia's bushfire history, prevalence of 3D visualizations, and existence of skilled image makers) are compelling and reinforce the internal consistency.\n\nThe absence of any significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks, combined with the high internal confidence, leads to a final confidence score of 9. While the external check couldn't definitively verify every detail, its findings don't contradict the internal assessment.  Therefore, the caption is judged to be highly likely to be accurate, reflecting the visualization of the Australian bushfires as described.  No conflicting evidence was found in the entity analysis.  The absence of external links or confirmation of Anthony Hearsey’s specific project is not substantial enough to change the overall assessment of the caption’s accuracy in representing the image context.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy.  Internal validation is very high due to the clear image content and caption alignment. External validation, although slightly lower due to a lack of direct corroboration, finds the caption plausible and consistent with real-world events and skillsets.  No conflicts were identified."

The external check acknowledges the possibility of Biden taking questions in front of a green screen in certain contexts (like virtual events), but lacks evidence to support this specific claim.  It gives a lower confidence score (7) because it cannot definitively confirm or refute the green screen aspect.  Considering both checks, there's a strong indication that the \"green screen\" part of the caption is inaccurate.  The internal assessment with a higher confidence score carries more weight because it directly addresses the content visible in the image.  The conflict arises from the limited information in the caption's description and the fact that the image does not verify the green screen.  The external validation tries to account for plausible scenarios, but without supporting evidence, it can't verify it. The confidence score is 8 because the internal check aligns directly with the visual evidence, while the external one relies on possible scenarios which aren't confirmed.

        "explanation": "The original caption claims that members of Antifa groups attacked an elderly white woman and that Malia Obama was arrested in connection with this alleged assault.  Both the internal and external checks decisively refute this caption. \n\nInternal Check:\nThe internal check analyzes the image itself. The image shows Barack Obama with his two daughters, Malia and Sasha, in a relaxed domestic setting. There is absolutely no visual evidence whatsoever to support the caption's claim of an attack, an arrest, or any involvement of Malia Obama in any violent incident. The lack of any relevant visual elements results in a confidence score of 0 and a verdict of False from the internal check. The internal check perfectly aligns with the visual information and lacks any indication of the events described in the caption.  There is no depiction of violence, arrest, or even any suggestion of a conflict. The scene is entirely peaceful and familial.\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check goes beyond the image and assesses the factual accuracy of the caption's claims. It finds the claim highly implausible for several key reasons.  Firstly, while there are documented instances of violence linked to certain Antifa groups, the connection between such an event and Malia Obama is entirely unsubstantiated. The external check emphasizes the absence of credible reporting from reputable news sources to support the arrest claim. The lack of corroborating evidence from mainstream media strongly suggests that the claim is false and likely part of a misinformation campaign.  The external check highlights the dangers of disseminating such unsubstantiated claims, emphasizing the potential contribution to the spread of misinformation and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. The external check provides a confidence score of 2 and a verdict of False.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is no conflict between the internal and external checks.  Both independently assess the caption as factually incorrect and out of context. The internal check focuses on the lack of visual evidence in the image, while the external check examines the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim in the broader context.  The convergence of these two independent assessments strengthens the conclusion that the caption is entirely unfounded.   The internal check's confidence score is 0 because there's nothing in the image that even hints at what the caption describes.  The external check gives a score of 2 due to the plausibility analysis, even in the absence of a direct contradiction. But when combined, the lack of any support from either analysis leads to a combined confidence score of 10.  The information presented in the image and confirmed by independent external investigation clearly points to the caption being completely false and out of context.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on both the internal and external checks, the caption is definitively out of context (OOC = True). The combined evidence overwhelmingly supports this conclusion with a high degree of confidence (confidence score = 10).  The caption falsely links a supposed Antifa attack and a completely unrelated image of the Obama family.",

It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

Snopes identifies the document as a piece of racist memorabilia, potentially artificially aged, and not an official state-issued document. This external evidence has a confidence score of 6.  The conflict arises from the inherent contradiction between the image's visual content and the verifiable historical facts about the license's origin. While the image undeniably shows the text \"NIGGER HUNTING LICENSE\" and \"Missouri\", external evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the image does not depict a legitimately issued license from the state of Missouri.  The higher internal confidence score is based on a purely visual interpretation of the image without considering its broader historical context and verification from reputable sources. The lower external confidence score reflects the limitations of relying on a single source (Snopes) for historical verification.  The overall assessment favors the external validation because it incorporates historical context and investigative reporting, which is crucial for accurately assessing the image's authenticity and the accuracy of the caption.

        "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy based on the clear presence of Grace Coolidge and a raccoon in a setting suggestive of a White House event. However, the external check has a lower confidence score (7) because, while the image aligns with the general historical context of White House Easter Egg Rolls and Grace Coolidge's time as First Lady, there's no readily available independent verification of a specific event featuring a raccoon named Rebecca on April 18, 1927.  The discrepancy lies in the detail about the raccoon's name and specific date. The image itself offers strong internal evidence supporting the presence of Grace Coolidge and a raccoon at an outdoor event, consistent with the timeframe of the Easter Egg Roll. The clothing styles are consistent with the 1920s.  However, the lack of external corroboration for the specific named raccoon and date lowers the overall confidence.  Further research into White House event records from 1927 is required to definitively confirm or refute the caption's accuracy. The external check highlights the difficulty of verifying anecdotal details (the raccoon's name) even within a generally plausible historical context. This points to a significant limitation in relying solely on image analysis for historical claims, emphasizing the need for triangulation with other historical sources. In this case, the high internal confidence score is tempered by the lower external confidence score, leading to an overall lower confidence score and a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context due to insufficient evidence to support the naming of the raccoon and the exact date.  While it is plausible Grace Coolidge was at a White House Easter Egg Roll with a raccoon, the lack of verifiable information around Rebecca and the precise date means the caption is deemed to be out of context. The conflict highlights the need for a cautious approach when validating historical captions based on image analysis alone, especially when relying on specific details that are hard to independently verify.",

However, the external check finds insufficient evidence to support the specifics of the raccoon's name and the exact date, creating a conflict that lowers the overall confidence and leads to a conclusion that the caption is likely out of context."

            "content": "Claim:\nImages shared widely in September 2019 showed people easily climbing the same fence, or same type of fence, that U.S. President Donald Trump said \"can't be climbed.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn September 2019, some online observers attempted to ridicule U.S. President Donald Trump's boasts about the impenetrability of his southern border wall by juxtaposing his claims that the wall could not be climbed with video footage of what was presented as people climbing the wall.\nIn a widely shared tweet on Sept. 21, one user wrote:\n\"Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed. But Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\"\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump's September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \"Trump's fancy border fence...\" while another user joined in, adding \"But ... he said that you could 'fry an egg.'\"\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \"This wall can't be climbed,\" next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump's claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump's election as president.\nAnalysis\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure's resistance, the administration had invited 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \"This was the one that was hardest to climb,\" Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they're unbelievable climbers. This wall can't be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it's also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it's designed to absorb heat. So it's extremely hot. The wall is -- you won't be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot. So if they're going to climb it, they're going to have to bring hoses and water and we don't know where they're going to hook it up because there's not a lot of water out here. So it's a very, very hard thing to climb.\"\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump's claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \"world-class mountain-climbers\" testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it's clear that Trump's Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president's claim that \"this wall can't be climbed\" were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump's long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \"We've all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. ... This wall can't be climbed.\" So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump's claims.\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does)  a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \"can't be climbed,\" in September 2019:\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president's assertions, \"Mexicans have turned Trump's wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\"\nHowever, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \"very, very hard thing to climb.\" Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump's boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",

Snopes provides a strong counterargument, showing that the images were from different locations and times, making the caption's assertion inaccurate.  The high confidence score of 8 from the external check outweighs the internal check's score of 10. The external check's evidence, directly from Snopes,  is more robust, providing specific details on the discrepancies in time, location, and fence type. This discrepancy highlights the importance of corroborating evidence, and this case demonstrates that apparent alignment within an image and caption might be deceptive without broader contextual verification. While the image itself superficially supports the claim, the external evidence irrefutably shows the images used to create the claim were not from the same fence or timeframe.  Therefore, despite the initial apparent internal consistency, the external verification significantly undermines the caption's accuracy.

The discrepancy is minor, concerning the literal use of the same doll versus the use of similar-looking props inspired by its lore. The high confidence scores from both checks, coupled with the understanding of the minor semantic difference, make the caption reasonably accurate within the context of film production and popular culture.  The caption does not claim the *exact same* doll was used, only that the *Annabelle doll* was used in the franchise. This is true in a broader sense, even though a replica was used in the filming.

The internal check achieves a confidence score of 0, explicitly stating that the image depicts a young woman with a Canadian flag painted on her cheek, bearing no relation to President Trump, ISIS, or any threat to America. The discrepancy between the image and the caption is clear and absolute.  The external check corroborates this assessment with a confidence score of 1. It points out the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim that President Trump ever made such a statement. The check provides several supporting points: the absence of credible news sources reporting this claim, the extensive documentation of Trump's public statements, the lack of corroboration from fact-checking organizations, and the inherent illogic and geopolitical implausibility of the claim.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both independently and decisively confirm the caption's irrelevance to the image.  The high degree of agreement between the checks, coupled with the absence of any contradictory evidence, provides a strong basis for assigning a confidence score of 10.  In summary, the caption is entirely fabricated and bears no connection whatsoever to the image content.  The image displays a seemingly celebratory portrayal of Canadian identity, starkly contrasting with the hostile and inflammatory nature of the caption's statement.   There is no ambiguity; the caption is demonstrably false and unrelated to the picture.   The conclusion that the caption is out of context is not based on speculation, but on the direct lack of connection between the visual content and the asserted statement, further solidified by the absence of any supporting evidence for the claim made in the caption.",

I imagine George Soross nephews are lovely people. Im just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world.

Reuters reported that the only high profile guests seen in the town where they married other than former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under Bill Clinton, actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, and fashion designer Vera Wang.\nMezvinsky is an investment banker and the son of Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, both former Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nSearching the Nexis database for anything involving the couple, George Soros, and the word \"nephew,\" we found 35 news stories.

            "content": "Claim:\nA man in Ireland earned the nickname \"Shawshank Husband\" after he dug a tunnel from his bedroom to a local pub over the span of 15 years.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nInternet legend has it that an Irish plumber spent 15 years digging a tunnel from his house to a local pub so that he could enjoy a drink at his leisure without his wife's permission. This story has appeared on several web sites over the years, and despite its rather ludicrous premise it has repeatedly taken in some gullible social media users.\nThis rumor started with a September 2014 post on the web site \"Tyrone Tribulations\" entitled \"Omaghs Shawshank Husband Dug Tunnel from Bedroom to Pub Over 15 Years\":\nAn Omagh plumber tunnelled a hole from under his bed to the local pub 800 feet from his house over the course of 15 years, a court heard today.\nPatsy Kerr had been summonsed to Omagh County Court after it emerged he had been the cause of a collapsed sewage pipe from a neighbouring house. Kerr told the court about his secret tunnel and the reasons behind it:\nThe wife has a bad snore on her and after watching the Shawshank Redemption on RTE one night in 1994, I decided to do something about it so I waited til she was in a deep sleep and then set about digging a hole under the bed in the direction of the pub. I used all manner of tools from spoons to a heavy duty tunnel boring machine I managed to sneak down there when she was at the shops. It wasnt until 2009 that I hit the jackpot and came up through the womens toilet mop and bucket room.\nThe story was picked up by viral web sites such as Boing Boing and BuzzFeed (both of which later admitted that they had been fooled) before it spread to less reputable sites such as 8shit.net. As of October 2018, web sites such as mens-corner.net were still presenting this story as if it were a genuine piece of news.\nThis tale, however, is just a humorous bit of fiction.\nTyrone Tribulations did not specifically mark this story as satire, but it was replete with sufficient ridiculous details to clearly indicate that it was a work of fiction. The most telling aspect is likely found in the closing paragraph, which depicts a wife who simply shrugged off the fact that her husband routinely smelled of sewage:\nThe tunnel was finally discovered after the DOE performed a survey on a sewage problem which turned out to be caused by a pipe Kerr had hit accidentally, causing sewage to leak into his tunnel over five years. The judge questioned Kerrs wife as to why she never smelt the sewage odours from her husband. Mrs Kerr simply shrugged.\n\"Gombeen,\" the author of the article, also provided some humorous explanations when readers questioned the authenticity of his reporting. When asked how this Irish plumber could have seen the Shawshank Redemption in 1994 when the film wasn't released in Ireland until 1995, Gombeen remarked that years work strangely in the Emerald Isle. And when queried why this man would bother digging a tunnel when he could have just walked out of the front door given that his wife was such a sound sleeper (she apparently wasn't bothered by the noise of his power tools), Gombeen averred that the floorboards in Omagh are extra squeaky:\nTyrone Tribulations frequently publishes humorous material that pokes fun at life in Ireland. Although the site does not carry a disclaimer explicitly labeling its content as satire, they do state that the accuracy of their stories \"cannot be guaranteed.\"\nWe reached out to the site to confirm that this was a bit of fiction and asked the proprietor, \"Paudge McGaudge,\" what it was like to unwittingly fool thousands of people:\nI completely made the story up -- that's what my website does ... short local fictional stories. I've written 1000s now since 2012 but that was by far the most successful. I just thought about it driving home from work and wrote it up on my kitchen table in about 20-30 mins in Sept 2014. Within days it took off. I think the big pulls were: it being read out on BBC Radio 2 during the day as a funny real story; John Cusack tweeting about it; and Buzzfeed running with it before they realised it was fake. I don't mean to catch people out and take no pleasure in doing that -- I just like writing stories to make people laugh.",

        "explanation": "The original caption claims that a man in Ireland dug a tunnel from his bedroom to a local pub over 15 years, earning him the nickname \"Shawshank Husband\".  Both the internal and external validation checks strongly refute this claim.\n\nInternal validation finds no evidence in the image to support the caption's narrative. The image depicts a hole in the ground, which is not consistent with a man-made tunnel extending from a bedroom to a pub. The lack of human presence, tunnel structure, or any contextual clues related to Ireland or a pub in the image directly contradicts the caption's details.  The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete absence of supporting evidence within the image itself.\n\nExternal validation provides definitive proof that the caption is false.  The Snopes fact-check provides substantial evidence that the story originated as a satirical piece and was later disseminated as a genuine news item by various online sources, some of which subsequently admitted their error. The Snopes article serves as a reliable external source confirming the falsehood of the claim. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the definitive nature of the external evidence and its direct refutation of the caption's narrative.\n\nThe discrepancy between the image and the caption is absolute. The image shows an unremarkable hole in the ground, while the caption describes a complex, multi-year project involving a tunnel connecting a home to a pub. No aspect of the image aligns with the details in the caption.  The external validation eliminates any ambiguity by showing the caption's origin as a fabricated story.  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both categorically demonstrate that the caption is out of context.\n\nThe high confidence score of 10 arises from the strong agreement between both internal and external validations.  The lack of any evidence supporting the caption's narrative in the image, coupled with the explicit debunking by Snopes, establishes conclusive evidence that the caption is fabricated and wholly unrelated to the provided image.  In essence, the caption is not merely out of context but is factually incorrect.",

The image shows a man performing pull-ups on a tractor, seemingly in a rural setting. This aligns with the caption's description of Alex Craig working out on his parents' farm. The setting appears consistent with a Scottish rural area, which also aligns with the caption's information about Castle Douglas.  Therefore, the internal validation gives a high confidence score of 10, indicating strong visual alignment.  External validation explores the caption's claims using external knowledge. Alex Craig is a verifiable rugby player who has played for Gloucester and Scotland. The fact that he would work out on his parents' farm is plausible given that athletes often use their downtime for physical activity, regardless of location.  The location, Castle Douglas, Scotland, is geographically plausible and consistent with family ties in the UK for a Scottish rugby player.  However, a definitive confirmation of his workout location requires real-time information that is unavailable.  Therefore, external validation gives a slightly lower confidence score of 8, acknowledging the lack of real-time information.  Considering both validation results, there is strong evidence supporting the caption's accuracy. Both internal and external checks show high confidence scores (10 and 8 respectively). There are no significant discrepancies. Although there is no absolute certainty without direct confirmation from Alex Craig himself, the convergence of evidence from both internal and external validation supports the claim with high confidence. The slight difference between the confidence scores of the two validation methods is primarily because internal validation has direct visual access to evidence, while external validation relies on background knowledge and lacks real-time data. Considering the lack of contradictory evidence and the strong alignment between image content and the caption's information, the final confidence score is 9.",

The higher confidence score from the internal check stems from the strong visual cues present in the image aligning with the events described.  The external check provides a more cautious assessment due to the lack of verifiable date information.\n\nThere are no major discrepancies between the internal and external checks.

The substantial disagreement highlights the limitations of relying solely on image content for assessing the truthfulness of a claim.

However, the external check, also with high confidence (score 10), strongly refutes the caption's claim that Emma Watson retired from acting in February 2021.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, has debunked this claim, citing statements from Watson's manager confirming that her career is ongoing, despite a period of inactivity on social media. The discrepancy between the internal and external checks is significant.  The internal check focuses solely on the image and its relation to the caption's subject. It correctly identifies Emma Watson in the image.  It cannot, however, verify the truth of the claim regarding her retirement.  The external check provides concrete evidence—statements from Watson's manager—that contradict the caption's assertion. Because the external check uses reliable sources and offers direct evidence that refutes the claim, its assessment should carry greater weight. The high confidence score from both checks reflects the certainty of each assessment within its own scope, but the conflict demonstrates the importance of external validation in verifying factual claims. The internal check, while accurate in its assessment of the image, does not possess the capability to evaluate the veracity of the claim regarding Watson's retirement. This highlights the limitations of relying solely on image analysis for fact verification.  In conclusion, the caption is out-of-context due to the demonstrably false claim of Emma Watson's retirement, and therefore the statement should be considered false.",

Both the internal and external checks strongly suggest this caption is out of context and inaccurate.\n\nInternal Check: The internal check yielded a low confidence score (5) because the image provides no evidence to support the caption's claims. The image only shows Governor DeSantis; it offers no visual context regarding a conversation with President Biden, any specific comments made, the existence of a conference call, or any discussion about COVID-19 travel restrictions.  The absence of this visual evidence renders the caption's claims unverifiable based on the provided image alone.\n\nExternal Check: The external check also produced a low confidence score (2), further corroborating the caption's inaccuracy.  The external check highlights the lack of reporting from reputable news sources or official statements to support the claim that DeSantis used explicit profanity toward President Biden.  Such a significant and controversial statement, involving high-profile figures, would almost certainly have been widely reported and documented.  The absence of such reporting strongly suggests the claim is false.\n\nDiscrepancies and Conflicts: There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks. Both independently assess the caption as being highly unlikely to be true, based on the lack of supporting evidence.  The internal check focuses on the absence of visual evidence in the image, while the external check emphasizes the lack of corroborating evidence from reliable external sources.\n\nEntity Analysis:  The image and caption both correctly identify Ron DeSantis. However, the caption's assertion about his specific actions and words during a supposed conference call with President Biden are completely unsupported by visual evidence. The mention of COVID-19 travel restrictions, while relevant to the political climate of February 2021, adds another layer of unverifiable claims to the caption.  There's no indication in the picture that DeSantis was involved in a discussion about this topic.\n\nConfidence Assessment:  Given the low confidence scores from both the internal (5) and external (2) checks, and the complete lack of supporting evidence for the key claims made in the caption, the overall confidence score is 9 out of 10 for the assessment that the caption is out of context.  The high confidence stems from the strong agreement between both validation methods and the lack of any evidence contradicting the conclusion. The absence of evidence supporting the caption's extraordinary claim makes it highly improbable.\n\nConclusion: Based on a comprehensive analysis of the image, internal consistency check, external verification, and entity analysis, the caption is judged to be significantly out of context and likely fabricated.  There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Governor DeSantis made such a statement to President Biden.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate the caption is out of context. The image lacks visual evidence supporting the claims, and there is no corroborating evidence from reputable news sources or official statements.

In January 2007, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California was sworn in as the Speaker of the House, the first woman to hold that position in the history of our nation. She is currently the House Minority Leader. We are delighted to have her with us. Nancy Pelosi, welcome to WAIT WAIT...DON'T TELL ME.\n(APPLAUSE)\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Thank you, Peter. Hi, everyone. It's great to be with you.\nLUKE BURBANK: We met once, but I don't expect you to remember it, because I was panhandling.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBURBANK: Let's not get bogged down.\nSAGAL: Let's clarify something right off the bat. How are we to address you? What is the protocol? Speaker Pelosi, in honor of your former position? Leader Pelosi, in honor of your current one?\nPELOSI: Because we're all such good friends here, just say Nancy.\nSAGAL: Just say Nancy. Nancy.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: It sounds good, though, Nancy. So we're delighted to have you with us. We found out, and it should be obvious, given your success in politics, that you grew up in a very political family. You were raised in the business.\nPELOSI: Right.\nSAGAL: Your father was the mayor of Baltimore.\nPELOSI: Yes, he was.\nSAGAL: Right. So what was it like growing up in a political household?\nPELOSI: Well, it was like campaigning, forever campaigns, all the time. There was never a time when we weren't walking precincts or receiving volunteers at the door to pick up their brochures, their buttons, their bumper stickers, their placards that would be called lawn signs these days. And I learned how to count votes.\nSAGAL: Did you really? So, like, other kids were counting blocks, you were like going \"one vote, two votes.\"\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: When you were a baby, were you kissing babies?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: We were reading about your father's career and your involvement with him, and we read that one of the jobs that you had working with your father was that you kept his favor file. Is that correct?\nPELOSI: No, I didn't keep it but I worked on it. That is, to say...\nSAGAL: What is it exactly?\nPELOSI: What it is, is that if somebody - for example, if someone came to the door and said they needed help in some way, if they needed help finding a job or something like that. The idea was, of the favor file was that when that person was on his or her feet then they would extend a helping hand to somebody else. In other words, they passed it on.\nSAGAL: Really?\nPELOSI: So where would you go to look for help for somebody else is someone that you had helped already.\nSAGAL: Right. Or if you needed to have someone killed...\nPELOSI: Again, it was a very...\nSAGAL: ...call upon this person.\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Do I detect an ethnic slur there?\nSAGAL: No, no.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: I wasn't at all thinking about that scene from \"The Godfather.\" I really wasn't.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCHARLIE PIERCE: Leader Pelosi, we have no idea who this guy is doing the interview.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: So, eventually you got married, you moved with your husband to San Francisco and you got involved with politics there. You ran for office yourself. You know, when you went into politics, you did it with a splash.\nOf course, you rose through the ranks of the Democratic Party in the House, and you became the Speaker of the House. You're our first Speaker of the House we've ever had on the show. We have a lot of questions about that. Primarily, what is it like to sit behind the president during the State of the Union address?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Is it hard to maintain a straight face?\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Well, I'm glad you're getting down to the truly important here...\nSAGAL: Yes.\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: ...Speaker of the House.\nSAGAL: No, really, I mean it must - because you know, like the nation is looking at the president and you are looming there over his shoulder. You could wreak havoc with the address if you wanted to, by making faces. Do you have to think about, like...\nPELOSI: Well, one could.\nSAGAL: Yes.\nPELOSI: Well, here's the thing...\nSAGAL: Yeah.\nPELOSI: ...the Speaker of the House has awesome power. And so when the joint session is called and the president of the United States is welcomed in a joint session, House and Senate, it is the Speaker of the House who introduces the president. Not that that's the power part, but it's a manifestation...\nSAGAL: That is power. You could keep him waiting. You could be standing, and he could be waiting outside. And you could be like, \"So guys, what's up?\"\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: See the game last night?\nPELOSI: Well, no, but, you know, but you would want to be respectful now wouldn't you? I mean, under other circumstances you would want to be respectful...\nSAGAL: Yeah.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: I want to ask a little bit about the job. Do you ever talk to the current Speaker, John Boehner? Does he ever call you up and go \"I don't know how I'm going to get this done; these guys are being so obstreperous. What do I do, Nancy?\" Does that ever happen?\nPELOSI: No.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Really, you don't...\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: He doesn't invite you over, back to your old office just for a get together, have a good cry, you and him and talk about problems.\nPELOSI: No.\nSAGAL: No, really, I mean...\nPELOSI: Girls don't cry.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: No. Well done.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFAITH SALIE: Nancy, I can't believe I just called you that. Thank you.\nPELOSI: Thank you, Faith. I'll call you Faith; you call me Nancy.\nSALIE: That's a deal. I earnestly want to ask you about an issue that's dear to my heart and I understand it's dear to yours, which is chocolate.\nPELOSI: Oh, yes.\nSAGAL: We've read this too that this is your great vice, if you will, you're big into chocolate.\nPELOSI: I don't consider it a vice. I consider it...\nSALIE: A blessing from God.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: You consider it...\nPELOSI: Very dark chocolate, very dark chocolate.\nSAGAL: Very dark. So tell us what you can. Tell us what you're willing to admit of your chocolate consumption.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBURBANK: Let's get down to brass tacks. How many pounds of chocolate have you eaten today?\n(LAUGHTER)\nBURBANK: I'll take that as 20.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Well, Nancy, Madam Speaker, we have invited you here to play a game we're calling?\nCARL KASELL: I'm a hero to my sex.\nSAGAL: You made history as the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. But we felt that women have been hogging the spotlight for too long.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: So we wanted to highlight some masculine pioneers. Answer three questions about men who dared to go where no man had gone before, and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, Carl's voice on their voicemail system. Carl, who is Speaker Pelosi playing for?\nKASELL: Nancy is playing for Tom and Libby Deichsel of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\nSAGAL: All right, are you ready to play?\nPELOSI: OK.\nSAGAL: All right, here's your first question. One organization has been the target of repeated legal action by men who want the right to do what? A: be surrogate mothers? B: be a waitress at Hooters? Or C: be Playboy Playmate of the Month?\nPELOSI: Waitress at Hooters.\nSAGAL: You're right, that's what it was.\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Hooters have been sued a number of times by men who claim it's sexist that the company will not hire them to put on skimpy shorts and very tight t-shirts, tied under the bosom and serve...\nPELOSI: Oh please, that's enough. That's enough.\nSAGAL: Oh.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Well, you're offended. You're allowed to do it, we are not.\n(LAUGHTER)\nPIERCE: I don't know if you noticed, Peter, but the big hammer just came down.\nSAGAL: It sure did.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: All right, that's good. That was very good. Here is your second question. Brad Pitt, movie star, recently struck a blow for male equality when he became the first man ever to star in a Chanel #5 TV ad. Usually it's a female movie star.\nIn the ad, he says which of these immortal lines? I'm going to quote Brad Pitt. Is it A: I am like a cave dwelling fish; I have no eyes, merely a nose, open to experiencing, you?\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: Or is it B: The world turns, and we turn with it. Plans disappear, dreams take over, but wherever I go, there you are? Or is it C: If you wear Chanel #5, a handsome movie star like me might find you attractive. Otherwise, no dice?\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Well I'm sure it's not number three.\nSAGAL: OK.\nPELOSI: I only hope it's not number one, so I have to go with number two.\nSAGAL: You are correct, that is...\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSALIE: Nice.\nSAGAL: ...the particular quote from Mr. Pitt. I have no idea what he means but it apparently has something to do with perfume. All right, last question. Just recently, 24-year-old Rob Wilson broke the glass ceiling or floor, as the case may be, when he became the first man ever to do what? A: Watch The Oprah Network.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSAGAL: B: Be a demonstration model on \"The Price is Right\"? Or C: Date Donald Trump?\n(LAUGHTER)\nPELOSI: Oh gosh. I think it's number two.\nSAGAL: You are correct, in fact.\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)\nSALIE: Wow.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Auditioned, won an online poll and he became the first male model to appear demonstrating all the nice prizes on \"The Price is Right.\" Carl, how did Minority Leader Pelosi do?\nKASELL: Nancy, you had three correct answers, so you win for Tom and Libby Deichsel. Congratulations.\nSAGAL: Well done, another victory.\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: I hope this triumph ranks right up there with the Affordable Care Act in terms of your personal resume.\nPELOSI: Well, I'm happy - Tom and Libby, I hope to meet you sometime. I hope that those were the answers that you would have chosen as well.\nBURBANK: I do, too because they would have lost otherwise.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(APPLAUSE)\nSAGAL: Ms. Nancy Pelosi is the former Speaker of the House, currently the Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ms. Pelosi, thank you so much for being with us. What a pleasure to speak to you and good luck.\nPELOSI: Thank you, Peter. Thank you, Carl, Charlie, Faith and Luke and all of you. It was great fun to be with you.\nSALIE: Thank you.\nSAGAL: Thank you so much.\nPIERCE: Thank you.\nSAGAL: Bye-bye.\n(APPLAUSE)\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright  2012 NPR. All rights reserved.

            "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

The internal check highlights the presence of baobab trees in the image, which are native to Africa and specifically found in Senegal, aligning with the caption's description of the location. The external check acknowledges the plausibility of a runway being constructed near a capital city in an area with baobab trees, further supporting the caption's assertion.  There are no significant discrepancies between the two checks. The high confidence scores from both (10 and 8) indicate strong support for the caption's accuracy. The image clearly shows a fashion runway set up under baobab trees, suggesting an outdoor, unconventional setting. The overall context strongly suggests that this is a unique fashion show taking place in a location with distinctive characteristics.  The lack of contradictory information in the image or external knowledge strengthens the validity of the caption. Thus, it's highly likely that the caption is not out of context and accurately describes the depicted scene. The minor difference in confidence scores (internal: 10, external: 8) reflects a slight uncertainty due to the lack of explicit geographical markers within the image, but this does not detract from the overall assessment of the caption's accuracy.  The high degree of alignment between image content and caption text allows for a highly confident assertion of accuracy.",

The entities (Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle) are clearly visible and their interaction (interview setting) matches the caption's description. The date mentioned in the caption (March 7, 2021) is a known fact about the interview, making it consistent with the context.

The external check emphasizes the significant media attention surrounding the interview and the common practice of viewers analyzing visual details and sharing observations on social media. This validates the overall context described in the caption, which mentions the interview, social media reaction, and the event's prominent nature.  There's no direct contradiction; the absence of evidence about specific social media posts doesn't invalidate the plausibility of the caption's claim.  The external check's supporting points corroborate the caption's claim by acknowledging the significant public engagement and social media discussion associated with the interview.  \n\nThere's high agreement between the internal and external checks. Both checks highlight the strong alignment between the image and the broad context of the caption.  The discrepancies are minor and do not affect the overall assessment of the caption's accuracy. The lack of direct visual confirmation of social media comments in the image is addressed by the external validation which provides contextual relevance.

It was taken from a set of images published on 23 September 2009 in a Daily Mail article titled \"Six Flags over Georgia theme park submerged in Atlanta floods,\" in which the photograph caption and article text reported the picture as showing:\nThe upper part of the Six Flags Over Georgia's main rollercoaster is visible through the flood waters of the Chattahoochee River. The Scream Machine ride, once the tallest rollercoaster in the world, is all that remains visible of the popular tourist attraction after waters from the nearby Chattahoochee River in Atlanta flooded into the park.\nVersions of this photograph circulated in January 2016 (and again in May 2017) hinged on contemporaneous flooding events in several states; among those affected were Georgia, Missouri, and Illinois:\nA rare winter flood that brought record or near-milestone crests along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, claiming at least 25 lives in Missouri and Illinois, has largely subsided in the region. However, the Illinois River continues to rise in some Illinois stretches.\nThe National Weather Service says that's the amount that deluged much of Missouri and portions of Illinois over a three-day period starting Dec. 26. The pounding proved epic in some areas: The 11.43 inches that pummeled Springfield, Missouri, in December broke the city's 1895 record for precipitation for that month. Hydrologists with the weather service say such drenches occur in the U.S. only every 100 to 300 years.\nWhile the regions cited in various versions of the rumor were affected by flooding, Six Flags Over Georgia reported no adverse events on their Twitter feed (but invited followers to visit for holiday events):\nHad the park been underwater, potential visitors likely would have been informed via the same means, but instead Six Flags Over St. Louis repudiated the rumor via their Twitter feed:",

            "content": "The main event: A report published by the Electoral Reform Society in to the EU referendum says the campaign was dogged by \"glaring democratic deficiencies\" with voters turned off by big name politicians and negative campaigning. The group, which campaigns for electoral reform, was critical of both Remain and Leave, saying people felt \"ill-informed\" by the \"dire\" debate and it said the impact of political leaders had been \"minimal\". It wants a \"root and branch\" review of the way referendums are run, and has proposed a \"rule book\" to govern campaigns' conduct, a public body to intervene when \"misleading\" claims are made and a review of broadcasters' role. A government spokeswoman said the referendum result was decisive \"with one of the highest turnouts of any vote seen in a UK-wide poll in a generation\". A spokesman for the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, said it would consider the report's proposals. Its own report is due to be published later this month, with recommendations for \"improving the conduct and regulation of future referendums\".\nAlso in the news: PM Theresa May has said Britain's exit from the EU will open up new markets and opportunities around the world for British businesses. She said she was determined to \"make the most of the opportunities\" resulting from the Brexit vote. The prime minister was speaking ahead of the weekend's G20 summit of leading global economies in China, where she will tell fellow leaders the UK is \"open for business\". European Council President Donald Tusk has said the EU's remaining 27 member states will need to come up with \"a common diagnosis\" of the EU following the UK's decision to leave. He stressed it was not going to be their intention to talk about the UK at the forthcoming meeting of EU leaders in Bratislava or their negotiation strategy regarding the UK. He said this was to \"protect the interests of the members of the Union that want to stay together, and not the one which decides to leave\". And one of Mrs May's predecessors, former Labour PM Tony Blair, has said it is possible that Brexit may never happen if public opinion turns against it. While he conceded such an outcome was unlikely, he told French radio station Europe 1: \"Who made the rule that we have to stop the debate now?\"\nFinancial news: The pound has jumped to a one-month high against the dollar after a survey indicated the UK's manufacturing sector rebounded sharply in August. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the sector rose to 53.3 in August from July's figure of 48.3. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The weakening of the pound following the Brexit vote boosted exports, according to the survey, but it also indicated that the weak pound had pushed up firms' costs. Meanwhile, recruitment giant Hays has said the UK job market weakened \"significantly\" around the time of the EU referendum, but it is too early to judge the long-term impact of the vote. The company also said it had seen \"no evidence\" of any impact of the vote in markets outside the UK.\nThe main event: Theresa May has held a \"Brexit brainstorm\" at Chequers. The prime minister met cabinet colleagues to discuss developments since June's Leave vote. Mrs May has said the UK must focus on the \"opportunities\" on offer outside the EU as she reiterated there would be no second referendum. \"We must be clear that we are going to make a success of it,\" the PM said. \"That means no second referendum, no attempts to sort of stay in the EU by the back door. That we are actually going to deliver on it.\" The talks were billed as the most significant since the referendum result and took place following reports of tensions and diverging priorities among key figures. Two months on from the vote, the relationship the UK will have with the EU after its exit, in terms of access to the EU internal market and obligations in regard to freedom of movement, remains unclear. Former Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire told the BBC there was a \"definite fault line\" between ministers who believed Brexit was chiefly about ending free movement and those who wanted to see more \"flexibility\", meaning the UK did not yet have its \"ducks in a row\" for negotiations.\nAlso in the news: The EU referendum result could be hijacked by \"forces of racism, intolerance and hate\", the Liberal Democrat leader has warned. Tim Farron turned his fire on outgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, accusing them of a \"hateful brand of intolerance, racism and insularity\". He added that there was a \"justified\" anger at \"the political class\" amongst voters. National Front leader Ms Le Pen has said the UK's Brexit vote was \"the most important moment since the fall of the Berlin Wall\" and she and a number of other far-right leaders in Europe say they would like to hold their own referendums on EU membership. Mr Farage has always rejected similarities between UKIP and the National Front, accusing the French party of \"anti-Semitism and general prejudice\". Ms Le Pen, in turn, has accused Mr Farage of \"aggression\" against her party, for labelling it racist.\nFinancial news: There has been widespread criticism in the US of the European Commission's ruling that Apple should pay up to 13bn (11bn) in back taxes. Earlier the European Commission said, external Ireland had enabled Apple to pay substantially less than other businesses, in effect paying a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%. \"Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies - this is illegal under EU state aid rules,\" said Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The standard rate of Irish corporation tax is 12.5%. The Commission's investigation concluded that Apple had effectively paid 1% tax on its European profits in 2003 and about 0.005% in 2014. The White House said the ruling could cost US taxpayers, while the Republic of Ireland's government and Apple both said they disagreed with the record penalty. In the UK, confidence among consumers improved in August but remains below pre-Brexit vote levels, a survey has suggested. Encouraging economic data, low interest rates, falling prices, and high levels of employment have all contributed to a rise in confidence, market research firm GfK said, though there was a sharp drop in people's propensity to save in August. GfK's Joe Staton said there had been \"some recovery\" in consumer confidence in August compared with July, when the firm's figures suggested confidence dropped at its sharpest rate for more than 26 years.\nFrom the papers: \"Brexit divisions emerge , externalas Whitehall draws up leave scenarios,\" says the Guardian, as Theresa May met her cabinet at Chequers. \"Civil servants have been asked to assess the impact of a wide range of Brexit scenarios, from full membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) to a system under which some Europeans would need visas just to holiday in Britain,\" the paper reports. Meanwhile, the Express says that \"nothing will stop EU exit\", external as Theresa May \"ruled out holding a second referendum to back the Brexit deal she will strike with the rest of the EU\". Its article continues: \"Her team also slapped down speculation she could hold a general election before the planned date of 2020, to give voters a chance to give their verdict on Britain's exit deal. She also does not intend to give MPs in Parliament a decisive vote on when to kick-start formal exit talks by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.\" And the i describes the backdated demand to Apple, external as \"the world's biggest tax bill\" and lists \"what Ireland could buy\" with the revenue that the European Commission has ordered Apple to pay. The Republic of Ireland could fund \"100,000 new homes\" or \"a year of healthcare provision\", it says.\nFurther reading:\nThe main event: The UK and France have pledged to work together and \"step up\" moves to improve the migrant situation in Calais. A statement, released after Home Secretary Amber Rudd met her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve, said both countries would resolve the situation through \"close co-operation\". It followed a call from the president of the region, Xavier Bertrand, for migrants in Calais seeking asylum in the UK to be allowed to lodge their claim in France. But this plan was dismissed by a Home Office source as a \"complete non-starter\". UK officials currently check passports in France, stopping many from entering. Debate over border controls was a key issue in the EU referendum campaign, with David Cameron claiming the Jungle could move to England if the UK left the EU. But just weeks after the warning, the then-PM and French President Francois Hollande agreed a \"mutual commitment\" to keep it in place. After the Brexit vote Theresa May and Mr Hollande reiterated the commitment.\nAlso in the news: The August bank holiday weekend saw a number of politicians and officials give their views of the UK's future relationship with the EU. Lord O'Donnell, a former head of the civil service, said the UK might remain in a \"more loosely aligned\" European Union, despite the referendum vote to leave. The former cabinet secretary told the Times, external it would take \"years and years\" to separate fully from Brussels and suggested that public opinion and the EU could change in the meantime. However, he added that \"the probability of us not leaving is very, very low\". Continuing membership of the single market was the main concern of Conservative MP and former minister Anna Soubry. She told BBC Radio 4's the Westminster Hour that it was \"not impossible\" to keep Britain in the single market while controlling immigration. Remain supporter Ms Soubry is one of a cross-party group of MPs backing the Open Britain campaign, calling for the UK \"to have the best possible relationship with Europe in the future now that the country has voted to leave\". On the same programme, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock attacked PM Theresa May's slogan \"Brexit means Brexit\", calling it the \"most vacuous phrase in modern political history\". He said the UK faces \"a vast range of challenges\" as it leaves the EU and added it was \"about time that the prime minister got a grip on the situation\". And Germany's vice-chancellor warned the future of the EU itself could be in doubt if the UK's exit was handled badly. Sigmar Gabriel said the EU would go \"down the drain\" if other states followed Britain's lead and that the UK could not keep the \"nice things\" about Europe while taking no responsibility.\nFinancial news: The UK is the most popular destination in the European Union for overseas firms, according to government figures. A record number of investments were made by foreign firms in the UK in the year to April 2016 - before the vote to leave the EU - with the Department for International Trade recording 2,213 inward investment projects, up 11% on the previous year. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the figures showed \"the UK continues to be the place to do business\". Economist Simon French commented: \"What will be far more important than Brexit will be whether the political forces that shaped the vote to leave also put pressure on the UK to be a more closed/protectionist nation. This would have much larger (negative) ramifications for future inward investment flows.\"\nThe main event: \"Divisive\" and \"anti-immigrant\" rhetoric by UK politicians during the EU referendum helped to fuel a spike in race hate crimes in the weeks before and after the vote, a UN body has said. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination said prominent political figures had \"failed to condemn\" racist abuse and created prejudices during the campaign. The report expressed concerns at the negative portrayal of immigrants in the UK and a rise of racist online abuse. Some 3,198 hate crimes were reported from 16-30 June - a 42% rise on 2015. Abuse peaked on 25 June - the day after the referendum result was announced - when 289 hate crimes and incidents were reported across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlso in the news: Labour leadership candidate Owen Smith has claimed party leader Jeremy Corbyn was \"happy\" about the UK voting to leave the EU. Mr Smith made the comments during a sometimes ill-tempered hustings debate in Glasgow on Thursday evening, even pressing Mr Corbyn to declare that he voted Remain. Mr Corbyn insisted that he did. Mr Smith is attempting to unseat Mr Corbyn less than a year after he was overwhelmingly elected as leader. The Labour leader has faced accusations from some in the party that he fought a \"lacklustre\" campaign for a Remain vote. Meanwhile, former Conservative cabinet minister and prominent Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith has reiterated that Britain does not need to remain a member of the EU single market to be prosperous. Mr Duncan Smith also said he believed Article 50 would be triggered early in 2017, saying it would be crucial in shaping negotiations, external. \"You need to get on with a process because nothing focuses the mind than the idea that something is going to happen.\" He also dismissed rumours of tensions between cabinet ministers David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson as summer \"who hates who\" stories in the papers.\nFinancial news: Britain's consumers went on a spending spree in the run-up to 23 June's Brexit vote, revised GDP figures released by the Office for National Statistics, external show. The consumer spending increase, the biggest since before the financial crisis, powered the country's economic growth in the three months to June. The data also showed that investment by businesses unexpectedly rose compared with the previous three months. \"Our survey returns, which include the period leading up to and immediately following the referendum, show no sign so far of uncertainty having significantly affected investment or GDP,\" Joe Grice, ONS chief economist, said in a statement. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the \"deterioration of nearly every survey of economic activity\" between the first and second quarter of this year suggests economic growth will be revised down eventually. \"Looking ahead, consumers might be able to maintain strong growth in their spending for another quarter, but when inflation picks up in earnest early next year and firms follow through on plans to freeze hiring, they will have to slow down,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, the slight rise in business investment in the second quarter provides little reassurance about the post-referendum outlook, since few businesses anticipated the Leave vote and surveys suggest firms are recoiling from major financial commitments in third quarter. As a result, we continue to see a high risk that the economy enters a mild recession over the coming quarters.\"\nThe main event: Net migration to the UK was 327,000 for the year to March, according to Office for National Statistics estimates. The figures, external - covering the period before Britain voted to leave the EU - were down slightly on record levels. The figure for net migration of EU citizens was estimated to be 180,000, a slight decrease on previous figures. The release of the figures followed a report, external arguing that the vote to leave the EU is a chance to fix the UK's \"broken\" immigration system and restore trust in controlled migration. Think tank British Future said the Brexit referendum outcome was a \"vote of no confidence\" in existing policies and public expectations of curbs on low-skilled migration must be met. The think tank has also released a survey suggesting almost half of Britons do not believe the government will reach its net migration targets. Ministers have pledged to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by 2020.\nAlso in the news: The US Treasury Department has warned the European Commission about taking action against US companies over tax avoidance allegations. The commission is investigating tax deals granted to US companies for setting up headquarters in Europe and is expected to deliver a decision on Apple next month. The company could be hit with a multi-billion pound bill for unpaid taxes. The commission said there was \"no bias against US companies\" in the probes but the US regulator said action by Brussels would make it into a \"supra-national tax authority\" overriding the tax codes of its member states. And Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has appointed a minister, external to \"lead the Scottish government's discussions with the UK government on our future relationship with the EU\". SNP politician Michael Russell is to become Minister for Negotiations on Scotland's Place in Europe, subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament. Mr Russell, a former education secretary in the Scottish government, will be tasked with \"ensuring the best interests of Scotland are represented and protected in all Westminster EU negotiations\". And, according to Ms Sturgeon, he will also have a role \"influencing the UK's position\" prior to the triggering of the Article 50 process to leave the EU. A majority of voters in Scotland backed remaining in the EU.\nFinancial news: Sterling was down a touch at $1.3219 but remained on track for a weekly gain of about 1.5% against the dollar. The pound is also on track for its best week in six weeks against the euro, despite falling 0.2% to 85.32 pence. However, the Munich-based Ifo economic institute has blamed Brexit for a hit to German business confidence, with orders in the chemicals and car industries particularly subdued. Klaus Wohlrabe, an economist at the institute, said: \"Brexit has had a stronger effect now. Export expectations in the chemicals sector have fallen significantly due to Britain.\"\nFrom the papers: The Telegraph reports that ministers are considering plans to require low-skilled migrants from the European Union to apply for permits to work in the UK, external once it leaves the EU. \"Theresa May has said curbing net migration will be her 'absolute priority' during Brexit negotiations, despite warnings from EU leaders that Britain will be forced to leave the single market if it restricts freedom of movement,\" the Telegraph says. The Times, external reports that \"the three cabinet ministers charged with delivering\" Brexit have held a \"private summit to 'clear the air' after weeks of leaks and simmering tensions over their respective responsibilities\". The paper says the men it calls the \"three Brexiteers\" - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and \"Brexit\" secretary, external David Davis - \"have never had a close political affinity\".\nAnd finally...\nOutgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage has appeared at a rally for US presidential candidate Donald Trump. Speaking in Jackson, Mississippi, Mr Farage drew on parallels between Mr Trump's bid for the White House and that of the Brexit campaign's \"people's army of ordinary citizens\", which he said engaged successfully with the public prior to the UK's EU referendum vote. He said Brexit campaigners had \"smashed the establishment\" and the Republican Party candidate could do the same. But Mr Farage's association with Mr Trump has not gone down well with some senior members of UKIP, including its sole MP Douglas Carswell, who tweeted, external \"it's all going a bit South Thanet for the US Republicans\" - a reference to Mr Farage's failed attempt to win a seat in the Kent constituency last year. And Suzanne Evans, the former UKIP policy chief currently suspended by the party, suggested Mr Farage was trending on Twitter \"for all the wrong reasons\". And the outgoing leader is to be the subject of a a half-hour mockumentary, Nigel Farage Gets His Life Back. The title of the BBC2 comedy refers to the resignation speech made by Mr Farage in July, in which he said he wanted his life back. He will be played by comedian Kevin Bishop, who said the \"colourful character\" was a \"gift to parody\".\nThe main event: Owen Smith says that if he wins the Labour leadership contest he he will try to stop Prime Minister Theresa May triggering official EU exit talks unless she offers a referendum on the final Brexit deal or agrees to call a general election to approve it. He says that if he is elected leader, the party will oppose triggering Article 50 until the government commits to a second vote. Mr Smith's opponent Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire from some Labour MPs for what they saw as his half-hearted campaign to keep Britain in the EU. But Mr Corbyn's supporters have argued that not only did he put a proper shift in, his heavily caveated support for the EU is in tune with Labour voters. Mr Corbyn's campaign said Mr Smith's second referendum plan would be \"deeply unpopular\" and cost Labour \"an awful lot of seats\". Mr Corbyn has also set out some \"red lines\" Labour will be putting down during the Brexit negotiations, if he continues to be leader. They include \"full access to the European single market\" allowing finance companies to retain their rights to trade within the EU and ensuring Britain remains inside the European Investment Bank. His fourth \"red line\" will be ensuring \"existing EU employment rights and consumer rights and environmental protection regulations\" are retained and, fourthly, that all current EU nationals who have migrated to live and work in the UK are able to stay.\nAlso in the news: Former foreign secretary William, now Lord, Hague has a new job advising companies on how to influence the government's approach to Brexit, according to the The Times., external The US company he is working for, Teneo, lists HSBC, Coca-Cola and Nissan among its clients, according to the newspaper.\nFinancial news: Britain's credit card habit has been unaffected by Brexit, according to the British Bankers Association. There were 168 million purchases on credit cards in July - the first full month since the Brexit vote. This was higher than in June and the average of the previous six months. However, the number of mortgages approved by British banks in July fell to its lowest in a year, the trade body says. The number of house sales has held steady, according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs,, external but Britain's commercial property market has taken a hit from Brexit, the figures suggest. The pound has held on to recent gains against the dollar and the euro, on the back of a run of better-than-forecast economic statistics (pound to euro: 1.1670, pound to dollar: 1.3181).\nFrom the papers: Demand for new homes has soared since the Brexit vote according to one of Britain's biggest housebuilders Persimmon, the Daily Mail reports., external Canada's National Post reckons Brexit is likely to be \"less of a drag\" on the UK economy than feared and it could escape recession thanks to interest rate cuts and the underlying strength of the \"real economy\". The Independent's James Moore paints a less rosy picture, in his guide to post Brexit Britain, external, saying: \"A decision of breathtaking recklessness and stupidity has cost UK companies billions if not trillions of pounds. And the price will continue to be paid for years to come.\"\nThe main event: Leaving the EU could cost the Scottish economy billions of pounds, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned. Ms Sturgeon published an analysis of possible Brexit consequences, which concludes Scotland could lose between 1.7bn and 11.2bn a year by 2030. But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who leads the opposition in the Scottish Parliament, urged the Scottish government to focus on stability in the wake of the Brexit vote. A Scottish government spokesman, in turn, blamed the Conservatives for Brexit. A majority of voters in Scotland voted to remain in the EU, and both Ms Sturgeon and Ms Davidson backed Remain.\nAlso in the news: A Welsh government minister has said the \"jury's out\" on the economic realities of Brexit. The Labour-led Welsh government warned of economic damage from a Leave vote, as did others in the Remain campaign. However, Skills Minister Julie James told BBC Radio Wales the economy \"seems to be even-keeling at the moment\". A majority of Welsh voters backed leaving the European Union, despite the Welsh government's stance. And, according to a job advert, the new permanent secretary to the Welsh government - the most senior civil servant in Wales - will play an \"integral role\" in getting the best deal for the nation as the UK leaves the EU. Current Permanent Secretary Sir Derek Jones is stepping down after four years and his replacement will be responsible for \"ensuring that the Welsh government represents Wales' interest in emerging UK trade negotiations\". Among the skills being sought, external are \"solid commercial abilities\".\nFinancial news: Persimmon, one of the UK's largest housebuilders, has said that customer interest in its houses has remained \"robust\" after the UK referendum. \"While the result of the EU referendum has created increased economic uncertainty, customer interest since then has been robust with visitor numbers to our sites around 20% ahead year on year,\" said chief executive Jeff Fairburn. The boost to Persimmon and other building firms meant the FTSE 100 was 0.55% higher in early trade at 6866.39 points. Meanwhile, a survey of eurozone business growth suggested that any economic repercussions of the Brexit vote seem to have been confined to the UK so far. Financial information company Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index, external edged up to a seven-month high of 53.3 in August, from July's 53.2. \"The euro area economy continued to expand at a steady pace,\" Markit said.\nThe main event: The leaders of Germany, France and Italy held an informal meeting to discuss the future of Europe in the wake of the Brexit vote. The venue was the tiny island of Ventotene off the coast of Naples, chosen for symbolic reasons. Two Italian prisoners, Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi, external, held on the island during the Second World War, wrote the \"Ventotene Manifesto\" calling for \"a free and united Europe\". Following their talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi held a news conference on the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi, which is coordinating the EU's migrant rescue operation. Ahead of the talks, Mr Renzi wrote that the leaders wanted \"to relaunch an ideal, external based on unity and peace, freedom and dreams, dialogue and identity\".\nAlso in the news: Prominent referendum Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith has said Prime Minister Theresa May should begin formal negotiations for the UK to leave the EU \"as soon as possible\". He accused Remain supporters of trying to delay a triggering of Article 50, which starts the two-year process to leave the EU. Mrs May said she would not trigger Article 50 during 2016 but Mr Duncan Smith said she should start the process \"early\" in 2017, arguing that this would enable the UK to \"get on and make the most of our new found independence\".\nFinancial news: There is potential for a lose-lose situation when negotiations for the UK to leave the European Union take place, according to the director of a Brussels-based economic think tank. Guntrum Wolff of the Bruegel Institute told the BBC: \"If both sides take a confrontational stance, they will both lose.\" Mr Wolff also said the possibility of another EU member country following the UK's Brexit lead is unlikely, though there were causes for concern including low growth in the Eurozone.\nFrom the papers: Many papers lead with Team GB's Olympics success but the Financial Times, external warns that infrastructure spending has \"declined sharply since the vote to leave the EU\". The paper reports: \"The value of contracts for July dropped to 1.5bn, a fall of 20% against the previous month and 23% lower than a year ago.\" This will put pressure on Theresa May \"to press ahead\" with new projects, the FT says. The PM might be aided in this by her Chancellor, if the FT's profile of Philip Hammond is anything to go by. Mr Hammond's \"sober\" image belies a \"lively, risk-taking past\" in business, the paper says, describing him as \"a product of the swashbuckling Thatcher era\". Over at the Guardian are two contrasting views of Brexit. Economist Anatole Kaletsky recalls the legend of King Canute, external and writes that the referendum result will \"not turn back the economic tides driven by globalisation\". He predicts: \"As Britain's economy sinks into recession, and the government's promises of a quick 'successful Brexit' prove unrealistic, public opinion will shift.\" However, a piece at the weekend by the paper's own economics editor, Larry Elliott, says it is \"obvious that the sky has not fallen in, external as a result of the referendum, and those who said it would look a bit silly\". Mr Elliott says only \"an extremely deep and prolonged recession\" would make him regret voting to leave the EU's \"failed project\".\nFurther reading:\nThe main event: The City of London is seeking a \"bespoke deal\" having given up hope of getting full access to the European Union's single market, according to the Financial Times, external. The newspaper says those representing the financial sector will present their ideas to the government next month. The newspaper says the City thinks a Norway-style deal - with access to the single market but accepting free movement of people and contributing to the budget - would be \"politically and practically very difficult\" and is seeking its own \"unique\" deal - possibly a \"beefed up version\" of that used by Switzerland. BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom says the Swiss deal with the EU would not be sufficient for the City because it does not include \"passporting\", which currently allows international banks and businesses based in London to do business anywhere in the EU.\nAlso in the news: The UK government has reported a smaller budget surplus than expected in July. It was in surplus by 1bn in July - compared with 1.2bn in July 2015. The government said the fact the public finances were in surplus showed the economy was in a \"position of strength\" to face post-referendum challenges. Meanwhile a Plaid Cymru MP has accused the Welsh government of a \"reckless indifference\" to the country's needs in the way it has responded to the Brexit vote. Jonathan Edwards contrasted Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones's approach with that of the SNP in Scotland - Mr Jones's office dismissed the complaints as \"ridiculous\". And it's not just the City of London putting its wish-list for European deals to the government, according to Bloomberg, external. It says tech firms and data-centre operators want a deal that \"keeps internet borders open\" - European online shoppers' details currently \"zip across borders to giant data centres in the UK\" - amid concerns that changing data-protection agreements could lead to legal challenges.\nFinancial news: Following on from the slightly baffling \"They will soon be calling me MR BREXIT!\" tweet from US Presidential candidate Donald Trump, the Telegraph's Tim Wallace has laid out why he believes Mr Trump is a \"bigger threat to the global economy\" than the UK's decision to leave the EU, external. In the Financial Times, BBC Money Box presenter Paul Lewis argues that the current weakness of the pound means the 75,000 limit on the amount of savings protected if a bank goes bust should rise, external.\nFrom the papers: There's been a bit of number crunching as the papers try to weigh up Brexit's impact on the economy, two months on. The Guardian looks back at the week's economic data to see if it amounts to \"boom or gloom?\", external while the Telegraph comes down on the \"boom\" side of the argument, claiming it has the \"five charts which show Britain has escaped an economics apocalypse, external\". However elsewhere in the Telegraph, Allister Heath says, external that economists should \"relearn a little humility\" and admit that they cannot yet grasp the impact of a massive event such as Brexit as it is \"far too soon\" to tell. The Economist examines the difficulties, external of trying to leave the EU within the allotted two-year period, once Article 50 has been triggered, when trade deals are years in the making.\nFurther reading:\nThe Spectator says \"it's time to defend Brexit, external\", arguing there has been \"silence\" from Vote Leave and: \"Brexit risks being defined by its enemies and moulded to fit their caricature.\"\nHarry Phibbs, for Heatst.com, external, says reality is \"finally silencing the Brexit doom-mongers\" following news of a fall in unemployment claims and a boost to retail sales in July.\nYouGov says, external its polling suggests most people - 69% to 22% - believe, to quote Theresa May, \"Brexit means Brexit\" but there is little support for a \"hard Brexit\" with the UK leaving without seeking any formal trading relationship.\nAnd finally...\nThe main event: A new report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, external has highlighted a \"very worrying combination of a post-Brexit rise in hate crime and long-term systemic unfairness and race inequality\", in the words of its chairman David Isaac. The review found that black and ethnic minority people in Britain still face \"entrenched\" race inequality in many areas including health, education, employment and housing. BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the report also concluded there had been \"a spike in racism and hate crime in England and Wales after the Brexit vote\" while Scotland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU, showed lower levels of hate crime. The commission said \"the evidence suggests the minority of people with racist attitudes used that result to legitimise racism\", our reporter added, though he cautioned that the report's footnotes say the spike could also be due to \"increased reporting of these events\".\nAlso in the news: A former Conservative Party treasurer has suggested the departure of David Cameron and George Osborne following the Brexit vote may have been \"unnecessary\". Peter Cruddas, who was a key financial backer of the Vote Leave campaign, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money that he couldn't understand why the then-PM and chancellor risked their positions by backing Remain. \"I couldn't see why the politicians - the prime minister and the chancellor - really took sides,\" he said. \"You know it's up to the people to decide, are we in are we out? Sure they can give their opinions, but to campaign hard for one side left them in an untenable position. And I still don't understand why they left themselves in an untenable position.\" Mr Cameron resigned as prime minister following the referendum result and Mr Osborne left the cabinet when Theresa May took over.\nFinancial news: The Co-operative Bank has said economic uncertainty following the UK's Brexit vote may hamper growth. The bank, which almost collapsed in 2013, after bad property loans contributed to a 1.5bn hole in its finances, said market conditions are \"challenging\" for retail banks. The Bank of England lowered interest rates at the beginning of August to a record low, as part of measures to stimulate the UK economy after the Brexit vote. Co-op Bank said the vote could also lead to a contraction in the UK property market, affecting mortgage loan growth. While banks might be feeling the pinch, warmer weather and a weaker pound helped boost retail sales in July, according to official data. The retail data went against expectations of an immediate hit to consumer confidence from the UK's vote to leave the European Union - though some analysts predicted tougher times ahead. And the weaker pound could benefit farmers, who - for the time being - still receive payments under the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The payments are calculated in euros, meaning there could be a 15% increase in farmers' EU subsidies once they're converted into sterling - about an extra 500m.\nFrom the papers: The Telegraph's business section reports that ratings agency Moody's predicts that \"Britain's economy will slow down but will not go anywhere close to a recession, external\". The agency says a fall in sterling should offset the \"negative effect\" of post-Brexit vote uncertainty, though risks including further hikes in US interest rates \"could derail this forecast\". The Financial Times, external says a fall in UK unemployment figures in July are \"a sign of the labour market's resilience after June's vote to leave the EU\", although a fall in vacancies sent a gloomier signal. Elsewhere, Wednesday's figures showing the number of EU workers in the UK has risen to 2.2m attracts the attention of the leader writers in three of the papers that backed Brexit. The Daily Express call on the prime minister to \"demonstrate a firm commitment to border controls\", external during the Brexit negotiations. \"Nobody wants to see the EU workers currently living here threatened with deportation,\" the paper says. \"However it remains the case that we cannot accept a never-ending flow of new arrivals.\" The Sun, external says: \"Jobs, wages and public services are under enormous strain. Brexit has handed Mrs May the mandate to fix that historic error.\" Meanwhile, the Daily Mail urges the prime minister to \"hurry up, external and seize\" the \"great opportunities for a self-governing Britain\" that it says Brexit provides.\nFurther reading:\nThe main event: The number of UK workers from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 has passed one million for the first time. From April to June, workers from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia increased by 44,000 compared to the same period in 2015. Official figures showed there were now a total of 2.23m EU workers in Britain. UK unemployment fell during the same three-month period.\nAlso in the news: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he wishes the UK had voted to remain in the EU as he faced renewed criticism of his role in the referendum campaign. \"I did my best in that campaign,\" he insisted at a live BBC leadership hustings in front of party members. But one audience member said angrily: \"David Cameron came across far more passionately than you ever did.\" However, another said he had been a Eurosceptic but Mr Corbyn persuaded him to vote Remain in June. Leadership rival Owen Smith said a deal reached in negotiations on leaving the EU should be \"put back to the British people in a second referendum\". And Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said it was \"disgraceful\" that the UK had not guaranteed the right of EU nationals to remain. She called for a guarantee as she hosted a question and answer session with hundreds of EU nationals, many of them concerned about whether they would have the right to live and work in Scotland when the UK leaves the EU.\nFinancial news: Total UK unemployment dropped between April and June in the run-up to the Brexit vote, official figures indicate. The UK's jobless total fell by 52,000 to 1.64 million and the unemployment rate remained at 4.9%. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said that the UK economy showed \"impressive resilience in the run-up to the EU referendum and the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave\". However, he warned: \"It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this... It remains likely that softening economic activity and heightened uncertainty will take a toll on the labour market over the coming months.\" And for the first time in at least three years, British holidaymakers have found that a pound buys less than a euro at some bureaux de change.\nThe main event: A leading Vote Leave figure has said EU citizens in the UK have been \"left in limbo\" since the referendum. Labour MP Gisela Stuart is to head a cross-party inquiry, for the British Future think tank, which will examine what kind of legal status could be granted to EU citizens in the UK. Ms Stuart, former co-chair of the Vote Leave campaign, said the government should make clear \"soon\" that EU citizens in the UK - about three million people - will be allowed to stay after Brexit. Ministers have said it would be \"unwise\" to fully \"guarantee\" EU citizens' rights without a deal for Britons abroad.\nAlso in the news: New Secretary of State James Brokenshire is on a fortnight's tour of Northern Ireland to canvass public opinion on the implications of Brexit. The Northern Ireland secretary said he hoped to spend August talking to business and community leaders and politicians, and would also meet groups representing victims and survivors of the Troubles. Mr Brokenshire said the UK was \"a great and strong country with a bright future\" and that Northern Ireland would have \"a huge part to play\" in that future. A majority of voters in Northern Ireland backed remaining in the EU and some politicians have voiced concerns about the implications for the land border with the Republic of Ireland.\nFinancial news: UK inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 0.6% in the year to July 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. The price of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers, the Producer Price Index, rose by 0.3% in the year to July 2016 following two years of falls. \"There was no obvious impact on today's consumer prices figures following the EU referendum results, though the Producer Prices Index suggests the fall in the exchange rate is beginning to push up import prices faced by manufacturers,\" said Mike Prestwood, head of prices at the ONS. Meanwhile, the UK's benchmark share index fell in early trade, while the pound remained weak ahead of a big few days for economic statistics. Sterling has been under pressure as analysts wait for a string of key UK economic data due this week.\nThe main event: EU funding for farmers, scientists and other projects will be replaced by the Treasury after Brexit, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. In a move which could cost up to 6bn a year, the Treasury announced that it would guarantee to back EU-funded projects signed before the chancellor's Autumn Statement later this year. Agricultural funding now provided by the EU will also continue until 2020. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the weekend announcement but called on Mr Hammond to \"speak up on the importance of keeping Britain's membership of the European Investment Bank\". The Scottish government's Finance Minister, Derek Mackay, said the funding \"leaves Scotland hundreds of millions of pounds short of what we would receive as members of the EU\". And Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said the guarantee only covers \"about half\" of regional funding for Wales.\nAlso in the news: At a briefing for reporters, the prime minister's spokesman insisted that triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting the two-year process for the UK to leave the EU, \"won't happen before the end of 2016\" - even when asked whether it may or may not be triggered at any time in 2017. If the process does not begin in 2017, that could mean the UK does not actually leave the EU until 2020. The spokesman also said Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is the senior minister on duty in London this week, while Theresa May is on holiday in Switzerland, but he insisted the PM \"is still very much in charge\". Over the weekend, UKIP's Suzanne Evans told the BBC there was no need for the government to trigger Article 50, as it can bypass negotiations by transferring EU law into UK law. The government could then repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and \"we'd be out as soon as Parliament voted on that\", she claimed. She added that the person who wrote Article 50 \"never thought it would be used\" by an EU member state. And UKIP MEP Tim Aker told the Westminster Hour that, if the government does not put an end to free movement during Brexit negotiations, his party \"wouldn't be able to print the membership forms quick enough for people to take them away\".\nFinancial news: Some employers are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential impact of Brexit on their migrant workforces. Ian Brinkley, chief economist at HR professional body the CIPD, told BBC Radio 4's Today that some bosses are taking steps such as helping their employees to apply for British citizenship. If Brexit does happen, employers will have to spend more on skills and training, he said - but some could face recruitment issues given the already low unemployment rate and difficulties in getting staff from domestic sources. The FTSE 100 was becalmed as trading got underway for another week at 6,917 points - just 1.7 points higher. And housebuilder Bovis Homes said it was too early to tell what the impact of the EU referendum on the housing market would be but the \"underlying market fundamentals for UK housing remain positive\".\nThe main event: Wales should be allowed to borrow more money to prevent the economy suffering a Brexit \"slowdown\", Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has said. From April 2018, ministers in Cardiff Bay will have the power to borrow up to 500m of capital money to pay for infrastructure projects. Under an agreement with the UK government, that money will be available earlier if it is spent on the planned M4 relief road around Newport - but Ms Wood said there should be no restrictions on how the money is spent. A majority of voters in Wales backed leaving the EU in June's referendum.\nAlso in the news: A victims campaigner in Northern Ireland has launched a legal challenge to Brexit. Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, is seeking a judicial review, arguing that it would be unlawful to begin the formal process of the UK leaving the EU without a parliamentary vote. His legal team also claim it could undermine the UK's treaty obligations under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. It is the first challenge of its kind in Northern Ireland, though similar action is under way in England.\nFinancial news: The CBI has said the UK's economic relationship with the United States needs \"close care and attention\" after the Brexit vote. With the details of the UK's future relationship with the EU - an important trading partner - far from clear, the business organisation said \"the economic special relationship\" between the US and the UK needs to be top of the list of government priorities. \"The relationship between the US and UK is in incredibly good shape but we mustn't be complacent about it,\" said CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn. Meanwhile, James Rosener, president of the European American Chamber of Commerce in New York, said US companies are now thinking hard about future investments and London could lose out to Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin. \"I think the general consensus is there won't be any mass movement but it will occur in stages,\" he said.\nThe main event: The UK housing market paused for breath after the Brexit vote, but could take off again over the next 12 months, a poll of surveyors has suggested. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) survey showed house price rises slowed significantly in the three months to the end of July. However, the Rics survey suggests that house price inflation could resume its upward path within a year. A month ago - in the wake of the EU vote - surveyors were evenly divided about whether prices would rise or fall over the next 12 months. But any such growth is likely to be modest compared to 2015, or the start of 2016, when prices were rising by up to 10% a year.\nAlso in the news: Theresa May is to take a summer holiday in Switzerland after her first month as prime minister, Number 10 has announced. Despite being in the heart of Europe, Switzerland is not an EU member or a member of the European Economic Area, but signed its first free trade agreement with the EU in 1972. It is currently embroiled in long-running talks with the EU over how to implement a 2014 referendum result in which the Swiss people backed limiting immigration through quotas, including EU citizens. But the PM has previously said she loves holidaying there because she can get some \"peace and quiet\".\nFinancial news: While the FTSE 100 fell, shares in travel group TUI climbed as it reaffirmed profit forecasts despite a difficult year for the travel industry. The company - which includes Thomson and Hapag-Lloyd cruises - said there had been \"no apparent slowdown\" in UK bookings following the Brexit vote. TUI said it can charge more for countries such as Spain as demand shifts there from North Africa and Turkey.\nThe main event: The cost to the UK of leaving the European Union without negotiating a replacement trade deal has been highlighted in a new report. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that if the UK failed to negotiate any new trade arrangements, the cost could be the equivalent of 4% of economic output. The government has yet to start negotiating the UK's departure from the EU following the vote to leave in June. Ian Mitchell, IFS research associate and co-author of the report, said: \"From an economic point of view we still face some very big choices indeed in terms of our future relationship with the EU. There is all the difference in the world between 'access to' and 'membership of' the single market. Membership is likely to offer significant economic benefits, particularly for trade in services.\"\nAlso in the news: Nicola Sturgeon has announced 100m of extra funding to boost Scotland's economy and support businesses in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU. The Scottish government is to create extra support for job-creating projects and arrangements to help businesses deal with uncertainty. Ms Sturgeon has also called for the UK government to help boost the economy. The UK government's Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, is also to hold talks with business leaders and youth groups about Brexit - and has said he will work closely with the Scottish government. And a former adviser to the Welsh government has said Wales needs a dedicated minister for Brexit to co-ordinate its response to leaving the EU. Economist Gerry Holtham said plans to appoint an advisory group of business leaders and experts were \"probably not sufficient\".\nFinancial news: The Bank of England has stumbled in its post-Brexit economic stimulus plans after it failed to find enough sellers for new bond buying programme. It fell 52m short of its 1.17bn target to buy long-dated government debt, which has driven up prices and pushed down the return to investors. Printing money to buy up government bonds is a key plank in the Bank's plans to boost the economy, along with a cut in interest rates to a record low of 0.25%. In a statement, the Bank said it will make up the shortfall in the second half of the year, with details of exactly when to be announced in November. Meanwhile, a post-referendum fall in sterling has left the Ministry of Defence facing extra costs of up to 700m a year, say defence experts. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) says the increased costs are due to military equipment purchases made in US dollars.\nFrom the papers: \"Britain could be up to 70bn worse off if it leaves the single market after Brexit because of slower growth,\" is the Telegraph's take, external on the IFS report. The article adds that EU leaders \"have warned that Britain cannot remain a full member of the single market without agreeing to the free movement of EU migrants\". The Times reports that \"the value of the pound fell to its lowest level in a month\" following a widening of the UK's trade deficit, external and warnings of more quantitative easing. The Express, meanwhile, says the UK adopting the so-called \"Norwegian model\" of single market membership outside the EU could be blocked by Norway itself., external \"Oslo has said it may throw a huge spanner in the works by vetoing any future UK membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) over fears such a large country would dominate the small group,\" the paper claims, However, it also quotes the leader of Norway's Socialist Left party arguing that the UK could help secure a better deal for countries including Norway. The Guardian has an extract from a new book by US economist Joseph Stiglitz, who argues that the EU's problems are chiefly the fault of the euro,, external which needs to be \"radically rethought\". Mr Stiglitz writes: \"While there are many factors contributing to Europe's travails, there is one underlying mistake: the creation of the single currency, the euro. Or, more precisely, the creation of a single currency without establishing a set of institutions that enabled a region of Europe's diversity to function effectively.\"\nMore reading:\nThe main event: British retailers sold more in July than in the same month last year, defying predictions of a post-Brexit slump. Total sales increased by 1.9%, according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG's latest survey. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said warmer weather had \"boosted the UK feel-good factor and gave consumers a sense that 'life goes on' following the initial shock of the Brexit vote\".\nAlso in the news: Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones is putting together an advisory group of business leaders and experts on Europe to help ministers understand the \"real world impact\" on Welsh communities, companies and public services. At the same time Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies predicted a surplus for Wales, external after the UK leaves the EU, and accused Labour of \"wallowing in self-pity\".\nFinancial news: The Office for National Statistics released figures showing that the UK's manufacturing industry picked up pace in June as the sector showed signs of recovery in the run up to Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Manufacturing output fell by 0.3%, stepping up from a 0.6% drop in May, but below the 0.0% expected by economists. \"Very few\" respondents reported an impact from the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote, the Office for National Statistics said. The pound was trading near a one-month low as manufacturing failed to meet expectations and the Bank of England's Ian McCafferty suggested more quantitative easing may be needed if the UK's economic decline worsens.\nThe main event: The Bank of England deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, told the BBC's Today programme there could be a further interest rate cut this year if the economy worsens, following Thursday's cut from 0.5% to 0.25%. Mr Broadbent said the Bank had acted after a series of surveys since the referendum on most aspects of the economy, including employment, the housing market and business confidence, which had turned down markedly.\nAlso in the news: The referendum was also a point of conflict in last night's Labour leadership hustings, with challenger Owen Smith sticking to his promise of a second referendum and Jeremy Corbyn saying he accepted that the \"majority of people, sadly, did vote to leave\" the EU and the party \"has to win those people back\". IHS Markit's monthly jobs report suggests the number of people in the UK securing a permanent job has fallen for two months in a row, with participants citing uncertainty caused by Brexit, although the group which sponsors the survey predicted confidence could return to employers as the political situation stabilises. The chief executive of Renault-Nissan has told the BBC he is \"reasonably optimistic\" that the UK will be an important partner with the EU, despite its vote to leave.\nFinancial news: The FTSE 100 has erased earlier gains to be flat at 6,741 - not helped by a 6% slide in RBS shares. That was after an earlier jump to its highest level in a year this morning as investors welcomed the Bank of England's new stimulus package.\nFinancial news: All eyes are on the Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates - which saw the value of the pound fall more than 1% against the dollar. The Bank has left its forecast for growth this year steady at 2% but 2017 brings a sharp downgrade to growth of just 0.8%, from a previous estimate of 2.3%. The Bank says the outlook has \"weakened markedly\" following the referendum vote.\nFrom the papers: The Guardian carries a warning, external that leaving the EU could \"kill off\" fruit and vegetable production if foreign workers are prevented from coming to the UK. The Financial Times reports pension funds are worried by, external a new round of quantitative easing, which is part of the steps announced by Bank of England to offset a slowdown in growth following the Brexit vote. An editorial in the Telegraph, external argues that UKIP needs to \"face up to its responsibilities\" and ensure the party is in a position to play an active role in the process by which the UK leaves the EU. And The Times' science correspondent sees tough decisions ahead, external for Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom, as the powers the UK will regain over farming could \"make or break\" agriculture.\nMore reading:\nThe main event: UKIP, which is looking for a new leader to succeed Nigel Farage, published a list of the candidates that are eligible to stand in the contest. There was immediate controversy after MEP Steven Woolfe, regarded as the frontrunner, was disqualified after he missed the deadline for submitting his application by 17 minutes. Contenders who are going forward after being vetted by UKIP's NEC are: MEPs Diane James, Jonathan Arnott and Bill Etheridge, councillor Lisa Duffy and former parliamentary candidates Elizabeth Jones and Phillip Broughton.\nAlso in the news: Experts at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford have been looking at the existing system for EU migrants applying for permanent residence in the UK to examine possible issues that could arise if it was altered following the Brexit vote. They suggest if all the three million European Economic Area (EEA) citizens living in the UK at the beginning of 2016 applied for permanent residence in the same year, this would amount to the equivalent of about 140 years of work at recent rates of processing.\nFinancial news: Activity in the services sector saw its sharpest fall in seven years in July, according to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research is arguing the UK has a 50/50 chance of falling into recession within the next 18 months. The think tank says the country will go through a \"marked economic slowdown\" this year and next as a \"short-term consequence\" of the decision to leave the EU. However, its forecasts still suggest the UK will avoid recession, the economy growing by 1.7% in 2016 and 1% in 2017. The FTSE 100 opened at 6630.13 - down slightly on the previous day, but still close to its year high. Meanwhile, the pound was at 1.19 euros (its 52 week high is 1.43 euros, its post Brexit low was 1.16 euros).\nFrom the papers: The Guardian, external says charities fear Brexit will increase demand for their services but imperil their funding. According to the Daily Telegraph, external, as many as 2,000 farmers have been left in limbo after a string of multi-million grant schemes for the countryside were frozen after the Brexit vote. The Times reports, external that investors used fears over Brexit to withdraw 3.5bn from UK managed investment funds in June, dwarfing the worst month in the 2008 financial crisis. The Sun, external says Tory MPs and MEPs are rallying behind its campaign to axe the UK's burgundy passports and reinstate the previous British navy passport design.\nMore reading:\nThe main event: The UK has a new European Commissioner following the resignation of Lord Hill of Oareford, who quit as financial services commissioner after the Brexit vote. Sir Julian King, a career civil servant and former ambassador to France, will spearhead EU co-operation on terrorism, organised crime and cyber-security. It's being seen as a higher-profile role than that which was expected to be conferred on the UK following the decision to leave the EU, and could give an indication of how the Commission sees the future of the UK's cooperation with EU member states.\nAlso in the news: Theresa May's new cabinet subcommittee met to hold its first talks on how to strengthen the economy in light of the UK's vote to leave the EU. The prime minister has billed it as underlining the importance of \"building on the strong fundamentals of the British economy and ensuring that everyone who works hard is able to enjoy wage growth, job security and opportunities to progress\". The UK's net contribution to the EU rose last year to almost 200m a week, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nFinancial news: The UK's construction industry suffered its sharpest downturn in seven years last month, according to a business survey that suggests the economy is at risk of recession after the Brexit vote. The Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched down to 45.9 in July from 46.0 in June - the lowest reading since June 2009 and some way below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction. While better than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a reading of 43.8, the figures - compiled after the referendum - show commercial construction dwindled and confidence flagged.\nThe main event: The Sunday Times has published details of what it claims is David Cameron's resignation honours list - including prominent Remain campaigners such as Will Straw, head of Stronger In, Tory and Remain campaign donors Ian Taylor and Andrew Cook, and Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, Michael Fallon, Patrick McLoughlin, and David Lidington. Outgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the list amounted to \"rewards for failure\", but recently knighted Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne said it was right to recognise those who \"deserve a little bit more of a thank you than their salary\".\nAlso in the news: A Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, has raised the idea that a cross-party coalition of Lords could delay or block Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the EU, if Parliament is asked to approve it. And the BBC caught up with fishermen who were part of a pro-Brexit flotilla during the referendum campaign.\nFinancial news: The UK's manufacturing sector activity fell in July, a survey by Markit/CIPS suggests. The measure of output and new orders fell below the 50 mark that denotes growth for the first time since early 2013. Some analysts have interpreted as evidence that the vote to leave the EU \"has added to pressures on the sector\", with others advising \"it will take time to really understand\" the true implications of the decision. Those manufacturing figures sent the pound down 0.2% to $1.32. It had been up 0.1% until the release of the index, and the measure is now at its lowest level since February 2013.\nThe main event: All eyes are on the surprise delay in the Hinkley Point C agreement, which is only Brexit-related insofar as the referendum ushered in a change of prime minister.\nAlso in the news: Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, has played down the impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU, saying he firmly believed \"business will settle down\" in the wake of the referendum. That's despite BA and IAG reporting that currency movements cost it 148m (124m) in the latest quarter of trading, mainly due to the weak pound. High-profile London estate agency Foxtons has announced a 42% fall in profits, blaming uncertainty around the EU referendum for the fall. Earlier this week the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, said that the Brexit effect on the property market and house prices could take months to become clear. Following a written question from Conservative Lord Blencathra asking if UK passports will be changed from maroon to blue and remove the words \"European Union\" from the cover, the Home Office has said \"there are no immediate plans\" to alter its appearance.\nFinancial news: The FTSE 100 closed at 6,724 - up just 3 points, helped by strong trade in shares in financial companies. Growth in the eurozone slowed in the second quarter to 0.3%, official EU data showed on Friday, with analysts warning that the consequences of Brexit could harm the economy later in the year.\nThe main event: Theresa May embarked on the next leg of her European tour, taking in Bratislava and Warsaw. Her discussions with Slovakian counterpart Robert Fico and Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo are among the toughest she has had yet, given the priority attached by the two countries to maintaining free movement of labour between the EU and the UK. Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, hundred of thousands have moved to Britain, either temporarily or permanently, and Poles in the UK send back several billion pounds a year to their home country. Mrs May maintained any future deal would have to take into account \"a clear message\" from the Brexit vote over immigration control.\nLloyds axes 3,000 jobs: Lloyds has announced it will cut 3,000 jobs and 200 branches - partly due to changes in the way people carry out their banking, but also in expectation of a \"deceleration of growth\" following the UK's decision to leave the EU. That sounds like it might be what some are calling a #Brexcuse - blaming bad news on the EU referendum result.\nAlso in the news: Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is in Paris meeting French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. Relations between the two have not been exactly cordial so far, with Mr Ayrault criticising the appointment of his opposite number on the grounds he \"lied\" during the referendum campaign. Although the technicalities of the Brexit process are not officially part of Mr Johnson's portfolio - he said he hopes the UK will \"be as close as possible to\" France after the vote to leave the EU and that the two would work together \"as friends and allies\".\nFinancial news: The FTSE 100 closed 0.4% lower at 6,721, hurt by a 4% fall in shares in Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds' shares dipped with the news it is cutting jobs, partly in anticipation of slower growth after the Brexit vote, while Sky's shares were up 6%, with group chief executive Jeremy Darroch saying the Brexit vote \"doesn't really change our thinking on any of our markets\". The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says UK car production jumped more than 10% year-on-year in June, but warns future growth may be hit if the government does not maintain unrestricted access to the single market. One index of consumer confidence measured by YouGov for the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) sank nearly five points to 106.6 in July - matching its biggest fall in six years. YouGov said the \"public is still absorbing\" the EU referendum result but it is \"clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant dive\".\nThe main event: Prime Minister Theresa May has continued her series of meetings with other EU leaders, heading to Italy for talks with PM Matteo Renzi. There, she said she retained an \"open mind\" about the UK's trading relationships after Brexit amid reports some cabinet colleagues want the UK to pull out of the EU's customs union. Mr Renzi said the UK's vote to leave the EU was sad, but he hoped \"some good would come of it\". Mrs May's visit follows Downing Street talks on Tuesday with Enda Kenny and last week's meetings with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande.\nEC names Brexit negotiator: Michel Barnier, a former French minister and ex-European Commission vice president, has been appointed as the commission's chief Brexit negotiator, by Jean-Claude Juncker. Mr Juncker said he wanted \"an experienced politician for this difficult job\". Mr Barnier will take up his position on 1 October. He will not necessarily be the European Union's chief negotiator as the European Council looks set to head-up negotiations, with Belgian diplomat Didier Seeuws leading their preparations, while the European Parliament will also seek to take the lead at some stages.\nAlso in the news: MPs on the Home Affairs committee warn in a report that there could be a spike in migration ahead of Brexit. They call for the government to give an \"effective cut-off date\" after which EU citizens moving to the UK do not have the automatic right to stay. The \"most obvious\" cut-off dates they suggest, external include the referendum day itself - June 23 - the date when the UK triggers the two year Article 50 process of leaving the EU, which will be early 2017 at the earliest, or the date when the UK actually leaves the EU.\nFinancial news: Lots today. The Office for National Statistics released economic growth figures for the second quarter of the year. They show that growth was 0.6%, external, higher than 0.4% in the first quarter, and higher than expected. The figures appear to show uncertainty ahead of the referendum had \"limited\", if any, impact on growth. Meanwhile GlaxoSmithKline is to invest 275m to expand its UK manufacturing sites, saying the country remains \"an attractive location\" despite Brexit. The news is particularly interesting given the firm had warned ahead of the referendum of the impact a Brexit vote would have. The FTSE 100 index was up slightly on the GDP news, to 6749.12 at 16:00 BST, so once again nudging its high point of the last year. The pound was at 1.19 euros (its 52 week high is 1.43 euros, its post Brexit low was 1.16 euros).\nThe main event: There are no answers yet on what will happen to the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU, but diplomatic overtures continue with Theresa May hosting Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny at Downing Street. She said they were in agreement that Ireland and the UK \"want to maintain the closest possible economic relationship\". Mr Kenny said Brexit \"was not the outcome we in Ireland wanted\" but expressed hope the UK would remain \"outward-looking\".\nAlso in the news: There were widespread calls for action in June after figures showed a rise in reported racist incidents following the referendum - and now Home Secretary Amber Rudd has announced a review of how the police handle hate crime. Another consequence of the Brexit vote was Nigel Farage's decision to step down as UKIP leader. The contest to succeed him showed signs of livening up, with Suzanne Evans ruling herself out with a pledge to back councillor Lisa Duffy - and MEP Steven Woolfe heading to Manchester for his first big speech.\nFinancial news: No relevant financial data released. London's FTSE 100 index ended almost 14 points higher at 6,724.7 - well up on its immediate post-referendum level and approaching its highest of the past year. The FTSE 250 was up to 17,108, about 13% above its June low and back to average levels for the past year. Most papers carry the news that Ryanair plans to \"pivot\" investment away from the UK by cutting frequency of flights on some routes.\nFrom the papers\nFinancial news: London's main share index was lower on Monday morning, while other major European markets saw gains. Shares had been in positive territory until publication of the CBI's latest industrial trends survey, which suggested Brexit was hitting business confidence. The Financial Times reported that billions of euros have been pulled out of investment funds, external since the UK voted to leave the EU, although some analysts say this could just be an initial knee-jerk response.\nFrom the papers: What the commentators say: Roger Bootle of Capital Economics, writing in the Telegraph, external, is bullish about the UK's financial outlook, saying \"alarmist views have proved unjustified\" - with the equity market \"stabilised\" and the fall of sterling \"of net benefit to the economy overall\". Ian King in the Times asks whether Philip Hammond's courtship of Chinese investment could create the potential for clashes at Downing Street, external, saying Theresa May has been far more \"sceptical\" about inviting Chinese involvement in UK projects. The Guardian's Larry Elliott assesses some options, external for an \"economic reboot\", including quantitative easing or loosening credit controls - \"something governments need to have up their sleeves when time gets tough\".\nAnd finally... EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who once compared the EU to Nazis: \"I haven't met him, but I would love to, so that I can persuade him that there is more separating myself and Hitler than just a nuance.\"",

        "explanation": "The caption \"Image result for california wildfires 2018 from freeway\" aligns well with the image content. The image depicts a large wildfire at night, visible from a freeway with cars driving past. This strongly suggests a California wildfire scene, possibly from 2018.  The internal check gives a high confidence score (10) based on the direct visual match between the image and the caption's description. The external check also supports the caption, although with slightly lower confidence (8).  A source mentions a video of a California wildfire near a freeway, which is consistent with the caption.  While that source initially misidentified the video's year, it still validates the general scene description – a California wildfire near a freeway. The discrepancy in the year (2017 in the source vs. 2018 in the caption) is minor and doesn't negate the overall accuracy of the caption. Both internal and external checks support the caption, with the internal check showing a stronger alignment. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8), combined with the direct visual evidence, make a strong case for the caption's accuracy.  The external check's minor correction on the year of the event does not substantially affect the validity of the caption since the image still depicts a California wildfire as viewed from a freeway. The minor discrepancy in the year is outweighed by the strong overall alignment and high confidence scores from both the internal and external analyses. There is no significant conflict between internal and external checks; both point to the caption being generally accurate in representing the image content. Entity analysis further reinforces the alignment, showing consistent elements such as wildfire, freeway, cars, night scene, and California. Therefore, the overall assessment concludes that the caption accurately reflects the image's context.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks support the caption's accuracy, although the external check reveals a minor discrepancy regarding the year of the wildfire event.  High confidence scores from both checks indicate a strong alignment between the caption and the image's content."

The image depicts a large explosion, while the caption describes an FBI warning about a planned propane bomb attack.  There are no visual cues in the image to support any of the claims made in the caption (FBI agent, Missouri sheriff's department, Christmas timeframe, propane bomb). The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the scenario described in the caption (FBI warnings and propane bombs) but highlights the lack of evidence to confirm the claim. The low confidence score from the external check reflects the inability to verify the claim from reliable news sources and the absence of specifics. Since both the internal and external checks provide low confidence and find the caption to be unsupported, we conclude that the caption is out of context.  There is a significant discrepancy between the visual content of the image and the narrative presented in the caption. The image shows an explosion, but there's nothing that visually connects it to the entities, details, and specifics mentioned in the caption.  The external check suggests the scenario's plausibility, but this is based on general knowledge of FBI procedures and the potential for propane bombs, not on any specific evidence related to the claim itself.  To resolve the discrepancy, we need verifiable evidence (e.g., news reports, official statements) that corroborate the events described in the caption.  Without such evidence, reliance on the plausibility of the scenario described in the caption is insufficient to justify its connection to the image. The lack of specific details like date, location, and supporting evidence for the FBI warning reinforces the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The claim is essentially unverified and therefore its association with the explosion image is purely speculative.",

While the external check acknowledges the plausibility of such a meeting based on the individuals' political roles, the lack of visual evidence of McCarthy in the image significantly weakens the caption's accuracy. The internal check's low confidence score (3) and the absence of McCarthy in the image outweigh the external check's higher confidence score (8). Therefore, the caption is considered out of context because the image does not support the described meeting. The significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks highlights the importance of visual evidence for validating captions. Although the external check confirms the real-world existence of the individuals involved and the possibility of their meeting, the visual context is crucial for verifying the specific event described in the caption. A high degree of certainty requires both strong visual correlation and external factual validation.  In this case, the lack of visual evidence of McCarthy, a central figure in the caption's narrative, renders the caption out of context despite the external plausibility of a meeting between King and McCarthy.  The conflict emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to caption verification, integrating visual analysis with external knowledge validation. While external factors increase confidence in the identities of the people involved and the possibility of their interaction, the caption's context heavily relies on a specific visual context—McCarthy's presence at the meeting. This visual context is missing, creating a gap in our confidence. A more accurate caption would have to reflect the actual visual content or include more context to justify the stated meeting without the visual evidence.",

It validates the grammatical correctness and multiple interpretations of the caption, including a literal interpretation of the sheep looking towards Skye or a more metaphorical or artistic interpretation.  Both checks highlight the lack of definitive proof from the image alone that the sheep is indeed looking at the Isle of Skye.  While the background scenery hints at a Scottish island setting, it cannot be conclusively identified as the Isle of Skye. Therefore, while neither check finds the caption to be out of context, both express reservations due to the lack of explicit visual confirmation that the sheep's gaze is directly on the Isle of Skye. The confidence score reflects this balanced assessment, leaning towards accepting the caption as potentially accurate but acknowledging the uncertainty.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks agree that the caption is not out of context, although uncertainty remains due to the lack of conclusive visual evidence that the sheep is viewing the Isle of Skye. The confidence score is a compromise reflecting this ambiguity."

Both checks align on the core message: locusts are a problem in East Africa, causing significant agricultural damage, and the caption presents a plausible scenario within that context. The small difference in confidence is a reflection of the inherent limits in verifying a very specific, singular event based on an image and general news reports.

            "content": "Claim:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump leaked classified information about a U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia after receiving his first national security intelligence briefing.\nIt's standard operating procedure during a U.S. presidential election year for the duly nominated candidate of each party to receive one or more national security briefings after the close of the Republican and Democratic conventions. On 29 July 2016, the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Philadelphia, the mainstream media reported that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would receive their first such briefings as early as the following week.\nThe briefings aren't as detailed as those a sitting president gets, the Washington Post reported, nor is the information shared in them deeply sensitive, nor, in fact, are the briefings even required, according to historian Michael Beschloss. They began under the Truman administration in 1952 and are provided strictly as a courtesy to the candidates.\nOne respect in which the 2016 campaign differs from others in recent memory is the fact that there have been calls from some in both political parties to deny the other's candidate access to secret intelligence on the grounds that they can't be trusted  Clinton because classified information was found on her private e-mail server and Trump because he publicly called for President Vladimir Putin of Russia  albeit jokingly, Trump later said  to spy on Clinton's e-mail traffic.\nAs if made to order, a flap erupted on 29 July when Trump gave a speech in Colorado Springs in which he reiterated a familiar complaint about NATO member nations not contributing their fair share to pay defense costs, this time expressing displeasure that \"We pay rent for our base in Saudi Arabia.\"\nAs noted by The Guardian and others in reporting on the speech, the U.S. closed its main military base in Saudi Arabia in 2003. (Also, Saudi Arabia is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.)\nTalk of Trump revealing classified information at that moment appears to have originated via Twitter with this exchange initiated by journalist Ben Jacobs:\nA short time later, Jameson Parker posted an article on IfYouOnlyNews.com entitled \"Trump May Have Leaked Classified Info on His First Day Getting Intelligence Briefings.\" Parker wrote:\nIf America does still have a base in Saudi Arabia it was a site not meant to be made public. The consequences of having that exposed could quite have massive consequences for Americas role in the Middle East.\nThere are two possibilities here: Either Donald Trump is so woefully out of touch with American foreign policy that he thinks a base that closed down 13 years ago is still open  or he just leaked a staggering nugget of classified information. Should it come to light that there is indeed a secret base in Saudi Arabia, you can forget about homebrew servers  Trump just committed a massive crime.\nReverb Press followed suit, making essentially the same case. That article was tweeted, retweeted, and ultimately reposted on Daily Kos, Democratic Underground and other left-leaning sites, none of which appeared too concerned (at least initially) that what they were repeating was purely speculative; it was also false.\nConsider this: Nowhere has it been reported that Donald Trump actually had an intelligence briefing before he gave the speech in Colorado Springs. In fact, he gave that speech on the same day the Washington Post reported that candidate briefings could take place \"perhaps as early as next week.\"\nMoreover, Trump's complaint about Saudi Arabia and NATO countries not paying their share of defense costs is a familiar refrain  he mentions it in virtually every speech he makes about foreign policy issues. In point of fact, erroneously on his part or not, Trump has raised the specific issue of the U.S. having to pay rent on bases in Saudi Arabia before. He did it most recently in an interview with the New York Times on 25 March 2016  months before he was nominated and became eligible to receive intelligence briefings:\nFrom China to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance, protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend, when they're sitting with trillions of dollars, I mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, now they're still making a fortune, you know, their oil is very high and very easy to get it, very inexpensive, but they're still making a lot of money, but they were making a billion dollars a day and we were paying leases for bases? We're paying leases, we're paying rent? OK? To have bases over there? The whole thing is preposterous.\nThere is no evidence that Donald Trump received a national security intelligence briefing before his 29 July 2016 speech in Colorado Springs, nor did he say anything he hasn't said before about U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia.",

However, the external check provides strong evidence (confidence score 1) refuting the core claim of the caption. The external check reveals that the claim of Trump leaking classified information after a security briefing is factually incorrect.  There's no evidence supporting the claim that Trump received such a briefing before making the statements about the U.S. military base, and the information was not new; Trump had made similar public comments before. This discrepancy creates a significant conflict, undermining the internal assessment.  Given the strong external evidence contradicting the caption's claim, it is deemed highly likely that the caption is out of context. The external check's findings are more reliable due to their basis on factual verification and lack of evidence to support the original caption's claims.  The conflict arises from the internal check focusing solely on visual entity alignment (Trump's presence in the image) without considering the veracity of the event described in the caption.  Therefore, the final assessment prioritizes the external check's findings, resulting in a low confidence score.  A thorough investigation into the source of the original caption would be beneficial to verify the origin of the misinformation.

The external check's supporting points – South Africa's Covid-19 experience, the use of isolation chambers, and the role of paramedics – reinforce the internal check's findings.  The slight difference in confidence scores reflects the lack of explicit verification of the image's date and location in the external check.  There are no discrepancies between the checks. Both agree on the core elements of the caption: paramedics, isolation chamber, and a potentially Covid-19-symptomatic patient.  The high confidence scores in both checks, combined with the lack of conflict, strongly suggest that the caption is accurate. The absence of explicit mention of \"Pretoria\" and the exact date in the image does not invalidate the caption, given that the image's context strongly implies a South African setting consistent with pandemic response protocols during the Covid-19 period.

It was a real piece of racist memorabilia said to date from the 1920s (but actually artificially aged), one which was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in 1995.\nIn 1995, the New York Times and other news outlets published an articles detailing some of the racist behavior that allegedly took place at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. Reports claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"[N-word] Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign:\nhttps://youtu.be/0NqcZXVw8Ks\nThe media attention given to this event prompted the Department of Justice to look into the matter, and while DOJ investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event:\nOur investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years.\nFor 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground.\nSimilarly, news outlets reported that the most controversial incidents associated with the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" may have been staged for cameras:\nLast month,the media widely reported a story about alleged racist activities taking place at a gathering of law enforcement officers and federal agents was widely reported. Now, it appears those incidents may have been staged for cameras by a disgruntled former police officer at the \"Good Ol' Boys Roundup\" in Tennessee.\nThe New York Times reports in its Sunday edition that former Fort Lauderdale, Florida police officer Richard Hayward is the source of the stories. He reportedly made his allegations after the Roundup organizer in 1993 kept him from distributing David Duke campaign literature. Duke is the former Louisiana Ku Klux Klansman who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The organizer also told the New York Times that Hayward had tried to display \"white power\" stickers.\nThe newspaper reports Hayward fed his story to the National Rifle Association last spring. He reportedly also gave NRA officials the 90-second videotape of the Roundup that was shown in TV reports last month. The tape shows a banner warning, \"Nigger check point,\" and tells of agents selling \"nigger hunting licenses.\"\nThe Times report says the NRA officials informed a Washington Times reporter about Hayward's claims. That newspaper broke the story on July 11. The New York Times says Justice Department investigators and civil rights leaders have doubted the story from the beginning, although Hayward insists his videotape is genuine. The newspaper reports he has since had a falling out with the NRA, which now says its leaders doubted the videotape from the start.\nAlthough the hunting licenses may not have been sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, nor were they legal documents issued by the state of Missouri, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist, and some online stores still sell \"federal [N-word] hunting licenses\":\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia noted that a variety of materials with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States:\nThe battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",

The discrepancy arises from the caption's assumption about the crowd's identity, which cannot be confirmed from the image alone.

The external validation appropriately cautions against accepting the caption's assertion as fact without additional contextual information.  Therefore, although the image supports the core action described in the caption, the lack of contextual support for the claim about \"Caravan members\" makes the overall caption potentially out of context.

She was a high school cheerleader and Homecoming Queen and enlisted in the military after her graduation. She qualified very high in marksmanship and was trained as a sniper.\nMy buddy served with her recently in Afghanistan. He said on Easter day she was watching a road that lead to a NATO military base when she observed a man digging by the road. She engaged the target ... she shot him. Turned out he was a bomb maker for the Taliban and was burying an IED (a roadside bomb) that was to be detonated when a US patrol walked by 30 minutes later. It would have certainly killed and wounded several soldiers.\nThe interesting fact of this story is the shot was measured at 725 yards. I have trouble seeing that far. She shot him as he was bent over burying the bomb. The shot struck him in the butt blowing into the bomb which detonated. He was blown to pieces.\nThe Air Force made a motivational poster of her.\nSenior Airman Polly-Jan Bobseine is a Security Forces Journeyman assigned to the 823d Security Forces Squadron as a Fire Team Member, Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. She is 21 years old. Airman Bobseine was born in Chadwick Bay, New York, on 21 October 1984. She was home schooled and graduated in June 2000. She competed in state and regional High-Power Rifle shooting, achieved New York State's 2000 Junior Trap Champion title, taught skiing, snowboarding, and lettered in Swimming.\nAfter graduating high school, Airman Bobseine moved to Wyoming where she was employed as a horse wrangler until relocating to Tennessee to train horses professionally before enlisting in the United States Air Force, leaving in March 2003 for Lackland Air Force Base, Texas for basic training. Upon graduation, she volunteered for a special duty assignment to the 823d Security Forces Squadron, Moody AFB, Georgia, arriving in August 2003. Since serving in the unit, Airman Bobseine has completed Army Airborne Training, Air Force Physical Fitness Leadership School, and Army Combat Lifesaver Training. Airman Bobseine was recently selected as the 2005 Air Combat Command Outstanding Flight Level Airman of the Year.\nShe is an active member of the National Cancer Research Organization and volunteer children's swimming instructor. Airman Bobseine's military awards include the Air Force Achievement Medal with two Oak Leaf clusters, Meritorious Unit Award, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon with Gold Border and Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (Rifle and Pistol.)

Both the internal and external checks decisively refute this claim. \n\nInternal Check: The internal check aligns the image's entities (Edward Snowden and the NSA logo) with the caption's mention of Edward Snowden, scoring a high confidence of 8. However, it correctly identifies a significant mismatch: the caption's inclusion of Osama Bin Laden, the CIA, and the Bahamas, which are absent from the image.  This mismatch lowers the overall internal consistency, indicating a significant out-of-context element.\n\nExternal Check: The external check provides strong evidence against the caption's core claim. It points to the well-documented death of Osama Bin Laden and the extreme unlikelihood of such a high-profile secret being maintained. The check emphasizes the lack of credible sources to support this extraordinary claim, achieving a confidence score of 1. The absence of any corroborating evidence from reputable news outlets, government agencies, or investigative journalism strongly suggests that the claim is false.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis: There's no conflict between the internal and external checks. Both checks independently confirm the out-of-context nature of the caption. The internal check flags the mismatch between the image and the caption's additional entities, while the external check directly debunks the central claim of the caption as factually inaccurate and implausible.\n\nEntity Analysis: The image focuses solely on Edward Snowden and the NSA logo. The caption introduces elements (Osama Bin Laden, CIA, Bahamas) that are entirely unrelated to the visual content. This sharp disconnect reinforces the out-of-context judgment.\n\nConfidence Assessment: The combined evidence from both internal and external checks strongly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The high confidence score of 10 reflects the strong and consistent evidence against the claim presented in the caption. The lack of any credible support for the claim, combined with the internal mismatch between the image and caption, creates a high degree of certainty in the assessment.\n\nConclusion: Based on the comprehensive analysis of internal consistency, external verification, and entity alignment, it is concluded with high confidence (score 10) that the caption is out of context (OOC = True). The claim about Osama Bin Laden is demonstrably false, and the caption's inclusion of unrelated entities further highlights its detachment from the visual context presented in the image.",

The internal check gives a confidence score of 10 but marks the verdict as True because the entity \"Trump\" is correctly represented. However, the significant contextual information about the impeachment trial is missing from the image, making the caption partially out of context.  The external check, with a confidence score of 8, validates the core claim of the caption—that Trump's acquittal was controversial due to the Senate's procedures.  It highlights the debate about the lack of new witnesses and documents as a key reason why many felt the trial was not sufficient, which aligns with the caption's assertion that he didn't have a \"real\" trial. The external check notes that while he was technically acquitted, the interpretation of that acquittal is subjective.  Both internal and external checks show high confidence levels (8-10), but they don't perfectly agree on the claim's validity.  There's an overlap in that the external check supports the sentiment of the caption,  but the internal check emphasizes the image's limited visual scope, highlighting a disconnect between visual content and the factual information presented in the caption. Analyzing this conflict, we find that the caption's claim regarding the lack of a \"real\" trial hinges on a matter of interpretation and subjective judgment of the impeachment trial process. The image, by itself, cannot support this interpretive statement. Therefore, while the external check finds the statement generally understandable and supported by facts about the trial's controversy, the lack of sufficient visual context in the image leads to an overall assessment of the caption being out of context.

However, the external check does note that the claim is not inherently impossible, given the natural processes involved in tree growth. The external check's supporting points bolster this conclusion: trees can engulf objects; the caption might employ a slight exaggeration; and Vashon Island's existence and natural environment make such an occurrence plausible.  The discrepancy between internal and external confidence scores is minor. The internal assessment directly analyzes the visual alignment between image and caption, while the external assessment evaluates the broader claim's plausibility.

(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

The image depicts Mallory Franklin, a British canoeist, performing an exercise involving balance on a pilates ball while using a paddle. All entities mentioned in the caption are present and correctly identified in the image.  The external check, while also supporting the caption's plausibility (confidence score of 8), introduces a degree of uncertainty. The plausibility argument rests on the common knowledge that canoeists need balance and core strength, and that using a pilates ball is a suitable training method. The possibility of a canoeist training with a paddle in their garden is also considered realistic. However, the external check lacks definitive proof that this specific event actually occurred; its confidence score is moderated due to this lack of irrefutable evidence.  Despite the slightly lower confidence score from the external check, the strong internal consistency and the overall plausibility of the described training scenario outweigh this limitation. The discrepancy between the two scores isn't a significant conflict, but rather a reflection of the difference between direct visual evidence (internal check) and reasoned inference (external check). The internal check's high confidence in the accurate depiction of entities within the image is crucial in this assessment. There's no evidence suggesting any misrepresentation or conflicting information within the image itself, supporting the internal check's high confidence. The external check provides additional support based on contextual plausibility, but it correctly acknowledges the absence of definite proof.  The combination of the strong internal validation and the plausible external context points toward a high overall confidence level that the caption is accurate. The lack of concrete evidence that this specific training session happened does not invalidate the overall accuracy of the caption, given its consistent representation of the image content. In conclusion, the caption is considered not out of context, with a confidence score of 9 reflecting both the strong internal alignment and the reasonable external plausibility. ",

The external check, while also supporting the caption's plausibility (score 8), introduces a layer of nuanced uncertainty.  It acknowledges the possibility of such an event given the natural habitats of bears and the potential for unexpected wildlife encounters on mountain roads. However, it highlights the infrequency of such occurrences and emphasizes the dependence on contextual factors such as the time of year, the bear's behavior, and the proximity to human settlements.  The external check's lower confidence score stems from this inherent uncertainty in the likelihood of the depicted scenario.  There is no direct conflict between the internal and external checks; rather, the external check provides a more cautious assessment by considering real-world probabilities.  Both checks agree that the caption aligns with the image's content; the disagreement is only about how likely that content is in reality. Given the strong internal validation and the plausible external validation,  the overall confidence score is set at 9.  The image's content is unambiguous; the external check's concern is the rarity of the event portrayed.  The lack of contradictory information in the image itself prevents the caption from being labeled as 'out of context'. Therefore, the final assessment concludes that the caption is not out of context. The relatively minor discrepancy between the scores is due to real world considerations of event likelihood that add nuance, not outright contradiction, to the assessment.  Entity alignment is strong between the image and the caption; both clearly present a bear, a cyclist and a mountain road. The external check brings in an additional layer of real world knowledge about animal behavior and human-wildlife interactions which slightly lowers the overall confidence, without undermining the accuracy of the caption within the context of the image.",

The absence of a date introduces uncertainty.  However, the external check doesn't contradict the internal check; it only points to a lack of complete verifiable information. Both checks agree on the key elements: Mike Pompeo's identity, the location (American University in Cairo), and the plausibility of the event.  The discrepancy lies in the level of certainty: the internal check is more confident because it is based directly on the image's contents, whereas the external check takes into account the lack of explicit temporal information, thereby introducing some degree of uncertainty. Weighing both checks, the final confidence score is 9, representing a high degree of certainty that the caption is accurate, given the visual evidence and the plausibility of the event considering Pompeo's role and the location.

The external check emphasizes the need for image source verification and contextual information to determine if the event truly reflects a migrant caravan dragging a police officer.  The discrepancy arises from the difference between a visual interpretation (internal) and the likelihood of such an event being widely reported if it happened (external). The lack of corroborating evidence from external sources significantly lowers the overall confidence level. The internal analysis is limited to the image itself and does not consider the broader context, such as the event's location, date, and whether it aligns with documented events involving migrant caravans and police interactions.  The external check is more cautious, acknowledging the possibility of misrepresentation or manipulated imagery.  Given this disparity and the lack of independent verification, a conservative assessment is necessary, hence the lower confidence score of 5.  While the image seems to show a forceful interaction between individuals and a person in uniform, it is not definitively a case of a migrant caravan dragging a police officer. More evidence is required to substantiate this specific claim.

The external check acknowledges that the presence of a White House police officer is plausible but not easily verifiable. The conflict arises from the high internal confidence (based purely on image content) versus the low external confidence (based on the lack of historical evidence).

The image clearly shows an archaeologist in Egypt carefully working on an ancient sarcophagus.  The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10, stating that the image and caption accurately reflect each other. This assessment is based on the direct visual evidence of an archaeologist working on a sarcophagus in what appears to be an archaeological setting. The external check also supports the caption with a confidence score of 8.  It acknowledges the plausibility of the scenario, noting that Egypt's rich archaeological history and the prevalence of sarcophagi make the scene depicted entirely consistent with established knowledge. The supporting points provided further strengthen this assessment by highlighting the common practice of archaeologists working with such artifacts in Egypt. There is strong agreement between the internal and external validation methods.  Both indicate high confidence in the accuracy of the caption.  The slight difference in confidence scores (10 vs 8) is likely due to the internal check's more direct assessment based on the immediate visual content, while the external check involves broader contextual knowledge and the inherent limitations of verifying such a general statement without further specific details (e.g., location, date, etc.).  However, this difference does not contradict the overall assessment of a strong match between the image and the caption. There are no significant discrepancies or conflicts between the internal and external checks. Both checks are highly consistent in their positive assessment of the caption's accuracy relative to the provided image. Considering the high degree of alignment, and the absence of any conflicting information or reasonable counterarguments, the overall confidence score is set at 9 out of 10.  The slight reduction from 10 accounts for the inherent limitations of image-based caption validation, even when the correspondence appears very strong.  To reach a score of 10 would necessitate more stringent and comprehensive verification involving additional information or context beyond the image itself.",

The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of Disney implementing such closures, doesn't confirm the caption's specific reference to a particular time or event. The external check's confidence is slightly lower (8) than the internal check (10) because it relies on general knowledge of Disney's operational practices rather than specific verification of the caption's claims.  The low confidence from external validation is due to inability to verify the caption's claims concerning closures with respect to specific events. Although Disney has historically closed attractions for various reasons, the caption lacks specific temporal context for its assertion.  The discrepancy stems from the image only showing the park environment and a visitor, not explicitly showing the closures described. The lack of contextual information and specific details in the caption regarding dates or events results in a final verdict indicating that the caption is out of context.  There is no visual evidence in the image to support the claims of closures.

Crucially, the image provides no evidence whatsoever to support the claim of pregnancy or the involvement of any individual of a specific religious background.  The internal check's assessment aligns perfectly with the external check, which achieves a maximum confidence score of 10.  This high confidence stems from the corroborating evidence provided by a reputable fact-checking source, Snopes.  Snopes definitively labels the claim as \"Miscaptioned\", offering a detailed explanation for why the caption is inaccurate and misleading.  Specifically, Snopes cites that the girl in the photograph has an enlarged liver and spleen, a medical condition entirely unrelated to pregnancy.  The source not only clarifies the actual medical context of the photo but also highlights the attempts to spread disinformation using this image and connect it falsely to a specific religious group (Islamophobia). The Snopes fact-check is further reinforced by providing information on the origin of the photograph and the girl's actual medical history.  This corroboration significantly enhances the reliability and confidence score of the external validation.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both independently and conclusively confirm that the caption is completely out of context. The alignment is perfect, further supporting a strong confidence level in the final conclusion. The claim is not merely inaccurate, it is also deeply damaging, promoting a false narrative that could fuel prejudice and discrimination against a particular religious community.

The external check also provides a high confidence score (8), supporting the caption's claim of a surge in early voting in New York City during the 2020 US presidential election.  However, the external check expresses uncertainty about the \"record turnout\" claim, lacking specific data to confirm it. This discrepancy is manageable; while the record turnout part isn't fully verifiable with the evidence, the core message—a voter in NYC during early voting in the 2020 election—is strongly supported by both checks.  The discrepancy originates from the caption's ambition to generalize a specific moment captured in the image to a broader trend of record turnout.  The image itself doesn't inherently disprove this, but it also doesn't definitively prove it. Considering the strong agreement on the core description of the image and the context of the 2020 US Presidential election, the uncertainty in the generalization doesn't outweigh the strong evidence pointing to the caption's overall accuracy.  The confidence score of 9 reflects this balanced view: strong internal and external support for the central point, with a minor caveat regarding the generalizability of the \"record turnout\" statement.  In summary, the caption is not completely out of context but may be slightly overreaching in its assertion of record turnout; it lacks sufficient external evidence to confidently claim this.  The core message, however, aligns well with both the image and known historical context of the 2020 US presidential election, suggesting a relatively accurate caption despite the minor generalizability issue.",

The external check agrees that Trump spoke at CPAC in February 2021 but notes that while he strongly suggested a 2024 run, his campaign launch occurred later, making the caption partially inaccurate in its phrasing.

The external check also gives a confidence score of 8 because, while confirming the accuracy of the information about Oyo and SoftBank, it lacks specific details to provide an absolute confirmation of the caption's assertion. The combination of the checks, despite not reaching a perfect 10, strongly suggests the caption's overall accuracy.  There is no significant discrepancy or conflict between the two checks, both supporting the claim with high levels of confidence within their respective limitations.The primary limitation is that the image does not visually verify the financial relationship and pressures mentioned concerning SoftBank. However, given the readily available public information about the business relationship and OYO's financial challenges, this omission doesn't invalidate the caption's essence.

Tom Cotton of Arkansas sitting on a bed of gold bars during his time in the military recirculated on social media.\nThis photograph, displayed above, appears to be real. However, it does not feature Cotton.\nThis picture was reportedly taken in May 2003 and shows a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade after nearly 1,000 gold bars were confiscated from a truck in Kirkuk, Iraq.\nCNN reported at the time:\nFor the second time in a week, U.S. troops have discovered what appears to be a cache of gold bars hidden in a truck, which could be worth just less than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to a Pentagon official.\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade discovered 999 gold bars hidden in a truck during a routine traffic inspection near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk within the last two days, Pentagon officials said.\nWe have been unable to find a definitive and credible source for this picture, but it does match up with news reports from the time. The patch on the person's arm, for instance, appears to match the winged sword patch of the 173rd Airborne Brigade:\nAlso, because this picture was taken in 2003, Cotton can be ruled out because the senator didn't join the military until 2005. Cotton also served with the 101st Airborne Division (whose patch resembles the division's nickname of \"Screaming Eagles\"), not the 173rd Airborne.\nWhen we reached out to Cotton, a spokesperson told us: \"The man in the photo is not Senator Cotton.\"",

            "content": "Claim:\nThe National Cancer Institute has \"admitted\" that \"cannabis kills cancer.\"\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a quiet admission that marijuana kills cancer:\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe report in question is the NCIs Physician Data Query (PDQ) on Cannabis and Cannabinoids. The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as marijuana kills cancer.\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the overview section:\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells  including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet admission of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added quietly in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ prove that cannabis kills cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not prove anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be cured by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has no currently accepted medical use, which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Governments official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal governments center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI admitted that cannabis kills cancer uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way prove that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false.",

One of the more prominent purveyors of this particular celebrity death hoax has been the fake news web site MSMBC.co (deliberately titled so as to cause confusion with the genuine news site MSNBC.com), which on 21 February 2015 published a false report claiming the famous musician had passed away, then updated their hoax article again on 11 April 2015 and started a new round of the fake Willie Nelson death rumor:\nLegendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson's death first circulated early April 11, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson's property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.\n\"There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,\" said Det. Aldeson.\n\"Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,\" said County Coroner Frank Shultz. \"It's just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.\"\nThe shocking news comes just days after a recent \"60 Minutes\" interview where Nelson was quoted as saying \"Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.\"\nThe fake MSMBC.co article unfortunately fooled many readers as it made the rounds of social media again, even though it was completely false and was just a recycled version of the very same prank the site released months earlier. The latter part of the article's statement that the \"story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified,\" is technically correct, as nothing about the story has been \"officially verified\" because none of it is even remotely true.\nNo legitimate news outlet has reported on Nelson's death, which is not surprising since the 84-year-old music star is actually alive and well, still commenting on current political issues and singing about how he's not really dead:\nWillie Nelson may be getting old but he is so done with the death rumors.\nTwo days before the singer turned 84, (Saturday, April 29,) he released a timely new music video for his song \"Still Not Dead,\" from his newest album, \"God's Problem Child.\"\nNelson first sings in the toe tapping tune, \"I woke up still not dead again today.

Her death was announced by her family via social media. They did not reveal the cause of her death, but said that she had died \"peacefully and surrounded by family.\"\nNelson was the first member of her younger brother's band, performing as a pianist and singer. Like her brother, she grew up in Abbott, Texas, where they were raised by their gospel music-loving grandparents. Their parents, Myrle and Ira, divorced early; Myrle left when Willie was six months old, and Ira departed soon after, handing the children to the care of their paternal grandparents.\nBorn Jan. 1, 1931, Bobbie Nelson learned to play the piano by reading four-part shape-note harmonies in hymn books. And she fell in love with boogie-woogie, which she played for her school classmates.\nIn his 2015 autobiography, It's a Long Story: My Life, Willie Nelson wrote: \"Bobbie became accomplished at an early age. I lagged behind  and remain so to this day. Bobbie is a musician in the true sense of being able to play with great facility in any style. She learned to read beautifully and was known far and around Hill County as a genuine piano prodigy.\"\nBy age 16, Nelson had fallen in love with and quickly married a man named Bud Fletcher, who recognized the siblings' talent. Despite having no musical skills himself, Fletcher built a band called Bud Fletcher and The Texans featuring the siblings, with the Nelsons' father playing rhythm guitar. And because she was with her family, Bobbie Nelson was able to slip into bars to play  a scandalous situation for a young woman.\nThe marriage began to fall apart, though, and The Texans disbanded in 1955 when Fletcher and Nelson divorced. But because of the shame of Bobbie's work in honky-tonks, initial custody of their three young sons was given to Fletcher's parents  and Nelson couldn't continue to play in bars.\nIn a 2008 feature on All Things Considered, Nelson reflected on this difficult time in her life. \"I thought, 'How can I earn enough money to support my children and to show the world that I can support my children? I want my babies,'\" she remembered. \"And that was the hardest part of my life. And I couldn't play with Willie at that time, because I wasn't supposed to even enter into a club. They would not have agreed to let me have my children back.\"\nThe answer Nelson hit upon was to attend business college, and then get a job with the Hammond Organ Company in its Fort Worth location, where she demonstrated instruments.\nBut once her brother, who had already written hits within the Nashville country machine for artists like Ray Price and Patsy Cline, went to New York in 1973 to record himself, she heeded the call for \"Sister Bobbie\" to come record with him on the project that became Shotgun Willie. By then, her children were grown.\nBobbie Nelson went on to tour and record with her brother Willie for decades, appearing on many of his albums, spanning Red Headed Stranger in 1975 to The Willie Nelson Family just last year.\nNelson did not release a solo album of her own until 2008, shortly before she turned 77. It was called Audiobiography  and it was the only one she ever released. Co-billed with Willie, however, she released several albums: in 1986, I'd Rather Have Jesus; 1996's How Great Thou Art; in 1997, Hill Country Christmas; and 2014's December Day: Willie's Stash, Vol.1.\nIn 2020, Willie and Bobbie Nelson co-authored a memoir called Me and Sister Bobbie: True Tales of the Family Band. In it, Willie wrote: \"I've written a few books before, but there's one that passed me by. Probably passed me by 'cause the heroine is too humble to demand attention. The heroine is my sister, Bobbie. Bobbie's got the best story in our whole family. ... Without my sister, I'd never be where I am today. I've always needed her.\"",

The external check, using reliable sources to confirm or refute the claim of his death, provides definitive evidence that the caption is incorrect.  The conflicting results highlight the importance of considering both internal (visual) and external (factual) information for accurate caption validation. The external evidence clearly outweighs the internal visual analysis because the question is whether Willie Nelson has died, not just if the picture is a depiction of him.

        "explanation": "The caption claims that Marla Maples, President Trump's second wife, died in a plane crash in April 2017. Both internal and external checks decisively refute this claim. \n\nInternal Check:\nThe internal check aligns the image with the caption's subject, Marla Maples. However, it immediately flags the caption as factually incorrect because Marla Maples is still alive.  The internal check's confidence score of 0 reflects the complete mismatch between the caption's assertion of death and the reality of Marla Maples being alive. The explanation notes the factual inaccuracy regarding Maples's death and clarifies her marital status with President Trump (former, not current).\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check corroborates the internal check's findings with a confidence score of 10.  It cites a Snopes article that explicitly debunks the claim of Marla Maples's death in a plane crash. Snopes provides strong evidence that the claim originated from a fake news source and that the image used to support the false claim is from a completely unrelated 1997 incident.  The absence of any credible evidence supporting the death claim further strengthens the external check's assessment.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThere is no discrepancy between the internal and external checks. Both checks independently and conclusively determine that the caption is false.  The high confidence scores from both checks (0 for internal, due to immediate factual error detection, and 10 for external, due to reputable source verification) converge to confirm the caption's inaccuracy.\n\nEntity Alignment:\nThe entity alignment is initially accurate; the image clearly shows Marla Maples. However, the caption's factual error about her death creates a significant misalignment between the image's context (Marla Maples alive) and the caption's context (Marla Maples deceased).  This misalignment is a key factor in the 'Out Of Context' judgment.\n\nConclusion:\nConsidering the strong agreement between the internal and external checks, both showing a high degree of confidence, the conclusion is unequivocally that the caption is entirely out of context. The claim of Marla Maples's death is false, and the image shows her to be alive.  The external source, Snopes, provides indisputable evidence to discredit the false information, thereby amplifying the confidence in the 'Out Of Context' assessment.  The confidence score of 10 reflects the high certainty in the assessment's accuracy. ",

The external check meticulously explains why this is untrue, citing perfume regulation, the absence of supporting evidence, and the general implausibility of the claim.

Internal analysis reveals a mismatch: the image depicts open carry, contradicting the law's purported effect. The image lacks contextual information to verify the date, location, or legality of the depicted act. External verification strongly refutes the caption's core claim.  A reputable source identifies the claim as fake news originating from a known purveyor of false information.  This source details the absence of corroborating evidence from official channels and the disreputable history of the source website.  Both internal and external checks independently and decisively conclude the caption is inaccurate and out of context. The high confidence scores from both checks (internal: 3, external: 10) converge to support this conclusion.  There's no conflict between the checks; they consistently indicate the caption's falsity. The external check's higher confidence score is justified by its ability to directly trace the claim's origin to a known unreliable source and demonstrate the lack of any supporting evidence, while the internal check flags inconsistencies at a basic level.  The external source addresses the absence of statements from relevant organizations like the ATF and gun control groups that would normally comment on such a significant piece of legislation. Therefore, the claim is factually incorrect, and the image is presented out of the context of the claim.",

        "explanation": "The caption \"Some made the most of the cold blast with a sledge down the hillside at Butterley Reservoir in Marsden\" aligns well with the image content. The image depicts numerous people sledding down a snow-covered hillside, which strongly suggests a cold weather event. The mention of \"Butterley Reservoir in Marsden\" adds a geographical context that, while not explicitly verifiable within the image, is consistent with the scene depicted. The internal check highlights a perfect match between the caption and the visual content, assigning a high confidence score of 10. This indicates that the caption accurately describes what's shown in the image. The external check also supports the caption's plausibility, giving a score of 8.  It emphasizes that sledding on a snow-covered hillside during a cold blast is a common occurrence, especially in areas like reservoirs, and that the location mentioned does exist. The slight reduction in confidence score in the external check stems from the lack of specific details (e.g., date, weather reports) to confirm that the exact event described in the caption actually happened. However, the external check doesn't find any inconsistencies or contradictions. Both internal and external checks concur that the caption is highly likely to be accurate and not out of context.  The discrepancies are minimal; the external check simply highlights the need for additional evidence to reach absolute certainty, while the internal check focuses solely on the immediate visual match. The high confidence scores from both checks (10 and 8) strongly suggest a high probability that the caption accurately reflects the image content and the event it describes. Considering the image's visual clarity, the common nature of the described activity, and the lack of any conflicting information, the final confidence score is set to 9. The external verification emphasizes that while the caption is not directly contradicted by available information, absolute proof requires further corroborating evidence.  In essence, the image, coupled with the plausibility of the caption, generates a strong inference of a valid description. There's no reason to believe the caption is out of context, thus the OOC value is set to 'false'.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the caption's accuracy, with minor differences in confidence scores due to the external check's need for additional verification to eliminate all uncertainty. The overall assessment is that the caption is highly likely to be accurate and not out of context."

        "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the accuracy of the caption, stating that all entities are visually present and accurately represented. The external check, while also yielding a positive verdict, expresses lower confidence (7), primarily due to the unusual combination of a Messi jersey and a Liberian fishing boat.  The external check acknowledges the plausibility of each element individually – Messi's global popularity making it likely a fan would exist in Liberia, and fishing boats being common in Liberia – but highlights the unusual juxtaposition of these elements, raising concerns about potential staging or misleading context.  There's no direct evidence of fabrication; however, the unexpected combination necessitates a more cautious approach.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis:\nThe core discrepancy lies in the confidence levels. The internal check focuses solely on the visual alignment of entities within the image, whereas the external check incorporates contextual information and real-world plausibility, which leads to a lower confidence score.  The internal check doesn't consider the rarity of such a combination, while the external check correctly flags this as an unusual pairing.  There is no direct conflict in their verdicts, but the divergence in confidence scores is significant.\n\nEntity Analysis and Cross-Validation:\nThe entity analysis supports both checks. The entities – a young boy, a Messi Barcelona jersey, and a seemingly Liberian fishing boat – are all clearly visible in the image.  The cross-validation process involves comparing the visual evidence with the contextual plausibility.  While the visuals confirm the entities, the context raises a flag about the unusual combination, suggesting the image may not be representative of a typical or common situation in Liberia.  There is no explicit counter-evidence to suggest the picture is fake; the unusual nature simply warrants additional verification.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile the image itself is internally consistent, the external plausibility check introduces uncertainty.  Weighing both checks, along with the unusual nature of the scene, leads to a reduced confidence score (8).  The absence of definitive evidence to disprove the caption's accuracy, coupled with the visual confirmation of entities, prevents a conclusive judgment of “out of context.”  The unusual combination of elements, however, should prompt a healthy level of skepticism and suggests a need for more information to fully confirm the validity and context of the image.",

            "content": "Claim:\nA photo shared to Twitter on Feb. 13, 2021, documented a human-sized lion mane mushroom growing in a swamp.\nA photograph shared on Twitter on Feb. 13, 2021, claimed to depict a large lion mane mushroom growing in a swamp that at the time of this writing had been liked more than 46,000 times on the social media platform.\nhttps://twitter.com/es_aion/status/1360586394574462982?s=21https://twitter.com/es_aion/status/1360586394574462982?s=21\nA reverse-image search revealed that in the days following the above tweet, the photograph accompanied posts on Tumblr and Reddit that also claimed it featured a lions mane shroom. But there was virtually no credibility to the tall tale spun by the Twitter user @es_aion.\nThe lions mane mushroom has several other names, including monkey head, bearded tooth, pom pom, and its scientific designation, Hericium erinaceus. Native to North America, Europe, and Asia, these wispy, white fungi grow in a singly clump with long spines on hardwoods like Beech trees. And though the white fruitbodies of these mushrooms can grow to be football-sized  up to 15 inches in diameter, with its spines just under 2 inches  the edible fungus has rarely been recorded in the wild and never to the size of a human.\nBut as a Twitter user by the handle @transittracer pointed out, the photo in question actually showed an art installation by Susi Brister. Snopes contacted Brister, who confirmed that the tweet inaccurately represented her art installation titled, 613 Silky Straight in Swamp, which was initially made in 2013 and shown at the Lawndale Art Center in Houston, Texas, reported the Houston Press at the time. Austin 360, a Texas-based news outlet published by the Austin American-Statesman, described Bristers work as enigmatic quasi-human figures draped in strange textiles and then situated in the natural landscape.\nThe suit was handmade by me using platinum blonde hair extensions and there is a human inside the suit, Brister told Snopes, adding that the sculpture was part of a larger body of work titled, Fantastic Habitat.\nThe suit itself was tall enough to fit a model who was approximately 6 feet 2  and Brister said the 100 hair extensions still drug on the ground. The artwork is actually the photograph, while the sculptural suit was only created to be worn for the photograph.\n\"The banal details of the extensions themselves are 613 (which corresponds to the color platinum) and Silky Straight (which refers to the texture of the hair), hence the title of the piece,\" said Brister. \"It's meant to be mysterious, but also reveal the reality of the materials it's made from.\"\nBrister's photograph of the swamp-like ghoul was again featured in 2014 by the nonprofit arts organization Women and their Work. In a blog post, Brister described her work as depicting anonymous figures covered in textiles and inserted into a landscape:\nMy current photographic work depicts anonymous figures covered in densely textured or patterned textiles inserted into various landscapes as mysterious organic forms. Lush faux fur and vivid fabrics conceal the still figures, producing a bizarre visual and contextual relationship between the shrouded form and its environment and at times creating a landscape-within-landscape effect. Acrylic neon crystals, camouflaging textiles, twisted piles of brightly colored tape, and layers upon layers of artificial hair extensions shroud forms that integrate with or interrupt the natural environment in a seeming attempt to blend in, but which ultimately emphasize the gap between the natural world and its synthetic imitations.\nThroughout this work I am questioning the nature of sculpture, performance, and portraiture, playing with notions of natural vs. artificial, and challenging traditional photographic renderings of the figure in the landscape. At once both humorous and melancholy, these images resonate with a psychological tension, evoking notions of the sublime and the slippage between real and imaginary\nAs for its newly viral status nearly a decade later, Brister said that she's not sure why the photograph is receiving so much attention.\n\"I'm not sure why someone might choose to share the image now. A few months ago, at the end of 2020, quite a few people were re-posting the image on Instagram (both with and without crediting me)  with a lot of references to the feeling of dragging through the end of the weird year we just had,\" she said.\n\"I'm fascinated that this image seems to resonate for people at this moment in time, and I'm ultimately happy that people are seeing it. Though why anyone would post about it being a mushroom is somewhat baffling to me  I think it's much more interesting as a platinum swamp creature,\" added Brister.\nSo, while art may be in the eye of the beholder, the facts remain the same.",

            "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows members of the NYPD wearing \"I Can Breathe\" shirts mocking the death of George Floyd.\nA photograph of a group of men wearing shirts saying \"I Can Breathe\" spread online between late May and early June 2020 after the death of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd while in custody of Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer. The shirts appear to be in a Comic Sans font, and those wearing them are holding up a sign supporting the New York Police Department, prompting Snopes readers to ask us if they were members of the NYPD.\nThe shirts would appear to be both a dark and flippant play on words stemming from one of the last statements uttered by Floyd before he died on May 25, which was \"I can't breathe.\"\nBut the image actually shows protesters from a demonstration in December 2014, months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of an NYPD officer, and more than five years before the death of George Floyd.\nIn July 2014, Garner died as a result of police officer Daniel Pantaleo placing him in a chokehold. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for protesters calling for an end to police killings of black people. In early December 2014, a grand jury found \"no reasonable cause\" to bring charges against Pantaleo, triggering protests. In July 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered that the case against Pantaleo be dropped, and a month later, Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD.\nAccording to one report from the 2014 demonstration, about 100 people gathered outside New York's City Hall in support of the NYPD on Dec. 19, while other reports said the number was closer to 50. The pro-NYPD gathering, organized by a group called Thank You NYPD, faced off against around 200 counter-protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Organizers from Thank You NYPD told The Village Voice that their group was not made up of police officers, but \"citizens who appreciate the safety that the NYPD provides our great city. Ten million people policed by 35,000 officers is one hell of a task to handle.\"\nAt the demonstration, the pro-NYPD protesters chanted \"Don't resist arrest\" when the anti-police brutality demonstrators chanted \"I can't breathe.\"\nA video from the protest, by ReasonTV, sets the scene:\nA 2014 report from Gawker included some of the shirt-wearer's perspectives. An attendee named Mike Stables had flown in from Colorado for the protest, bringing \"I Can Breathe\" T-shirts with him.\nWhile it is not clear whether many NYPD cops were part of the protests or wearing the shirts, a number of people close to the police were present. Some attendees included a retired NYPD detective and a mother of an NYPD officer. According to CBS, neither Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, nor police unions, endorsed the rally because of concerns about violence. Bratton expected a low turnout. Patrick Lynch, a police union leader, complained about the lack of support from New York City's mayor and his administration:\nPetulant police union leader Pat Lynch recently complained of the lack of support coming from City Hall: \"If they're not going to support us when we need 'em, we'll embarrass them when we can.\"\nIn the above video, a pro-NYPD protester at City Hall responded to a journalist's comment on how the police use force to defend themselves: \"They do it with force -- well, no, we're not allowed to use force.\"\nSteven W. Thrasher, a columnist and faculty member at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, reflected on his coverage of the December 2014 protest for Contexts. By his account, off-duty cops were indeed present:\nHere I was, being 'protected' by the NYPD on duty, surrounded by angry, white, retired and off-duty cops and their supporters. Who hated the press and, it seemed, Black people  and I was in the middle of them.\nAnother report from Gothamist relates an exchange between protesters, indicating more off-duty cops were present:\n\"Where's your badge?\" one woman asked a man on the police side.\n\"It's in my pocket!\" the man replied.\n\"Why don't you take it out?\"\n\"I don't have to, I'm not on duty, bitch!\"\n... \"My boss told me to behave myself tonight,\" said Scott, a police officer who works in Connecticut.\nIt is clear from multiple reports that off-duty cops were indeed present at the pro-police side of the rally, but we are still unable to determine if any of them were wearing the shirts saying \"I Can Breathe.\" We do know that these images are from a 2014 rally supporting the NYPD after the death of Garner, and not in response to the death of Floyd. We thus rate this image as \"Miscaptioned.\"",

The explanation further points out the relevance of the George Floyd incident as background information needed to understand the message conveyed by the shirts, even though the image itself doesn't directly depict Floyd or Chauvin. This is crucial, showing an understanding of the implied context. The external check provides further corroboration, citing a source that confirms the image's online circulation during the period immediately following George Floyd's death.  It also highlights the shirts' symbolic significance as a response to Floyd's final words, \"I can't breathe.\" The high confidence scores (10 for internal and 8 for external) combined with the alignment of information across both checks point towards a high degree of accuracy in the caption. There are no significant discrepancies identified between the internal and external validation. Both checks converge on the core aspects of the caption: the existence of the photograph, the wording on the shirts, and the temporal connection to George Floyd's death. The external check adds valuable contextual information, reinforcing the internal check's assessment. There's no need for entity analysis to resolve conflicts because the checks are in agreement. In conclusion, there is strong evidence to support the accuracy and relevance of the original caption. The high confidence score reflects this convergence of evidence.",

However, it points out that the specific date and year of performance cannot be verified without additional information.  Thus, there's a mismatch in confidence levels, and the external check highlights a crucial missing piece of information: confirmation of the specific performance date. Since both the date and year (Wednesday) and the year of performance lack explicit external verification in the context, this cannot be confirmed from available data. Hence, considering that the date of performance lacks external verification and is a critical part of the caption, I will classify it as out of context.

        "explanation": "Internal validation gives high confidence (10) to the caption's accuracy because the image clearly shows a goose with its wings wrapped around a puppy, seemingly protecting it. This aligns well with the caption's description of a goose shielding a puppy from the cold. However, external validation expresses low confidence (4) in the caption's accuracy. While acknowledging that geese can exhibit protective behavior, it points out the unusual nature of this specific scenario and the lack of verifiable evidence to confirm the claim. The external check highlights the anthropomorphic interpretation of the scene, emphasizing that the 'love and friendship' aspect is subjective and not factually supported.  The conflict arises from the internal check's focus on the visual alignment between the image and the caption (goose protecting a puppy), while the external check questions the underlying narrative and its factual basis. The image only presents a visual snapshot of the goose and the puppy; it does not provide evidence of abandonment, coldness, the duration of this interaction, or the goose's motive. The caption's emotionally charged words ('Real love and friendship') should be treated cautiously as a likely anthropomorphic interpretation rather than an objective description.  Considering this conflict, and prioritizing the need for verifiable evidence, a moderate confidence score of 6 is assigned. The final OOC judgment leans towards 'True' because while the image depicts a goose and a puppy in close proximity, the claim of the goose actively protecting an abandoned puppy from the cold lacks substantial evidence. Further information is needed to confirm the implied narrative. The caption might be true, but also might be a misinterpretation, thus leaning towards 'out of context' is the safer conclusion.",
        "validation_summary": "Internal validation strongly supports the caption based on visual alignment, while external validation casts doubt due to lack of evidence and anthropomorphism.  The conflict is resolved by prioritizing external validation's emphasis on factual evidence over subjective interpretations.

This minor discrepancy doesn't significantly detract from the overall accuracy of the caption.  Both internal and external checks converge on the core facts: Trump's presence at CPAC 2021, which is accurately depicted in the image. The slight nuance about the campaign launch is a matter of interpretation rather than factual inaccuracy, as news reports from the time confirm Trump's speech fueled speculation about his 2024 intentions. Considering both checks yield high confidence scores, and the discrepancy is mainly semantic, a confidence score of 9 is assigned, indicating strong evidence supports the caption's essence. The caption accurately reflects the visual content of the image and is largely consistent with known historical events.

Both internal and external validation checks produced high confidence scores (8 out of 10 for each), supporting the caption's accuracy. The internal check highlights that the image depicts Highland cattle in a landscape consistent with the Scottish Highlands, which aligns with the mention of Pitlochry. The lack of explicit mention of Pitlochry in the image is not considered a major discrepancy because the general setting strongly suggests a location in the Scottish Highlands. The mention of Chris Boyle as the photographer, while not evident in the image itself, isn't unusual and doesn't contradict any visual information.  The external check strengthens this assessment. It points out that Highland cattle are native to the Scottish Highlands, Pitlochry is a real town within this region, and winter sunsets are a common natural phenomenon.  The existence of a photographer named Chris Boyle is considered plausible, making the entire caption plausible and verifiable based on the available evidence. There are no significant discrepancies between the internal and external checks.  Both support the claim that the caption is accurate.  The high confidence scores from both checks (8/10 each) provide a strong basis for accepting the caption as an accurate representation of the image content and context. Therefore, the conclusion is that the caption is not out of context (OOC = false) with a confidence score of 9 out of 10.

            "content": "Claim:\nA video shows a naked child using bedsheets to escape from an upper story of Buckingham Palace.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nContext\nThe video was released on YouTube as a \"stealth promotion\" for the E! comedy series \"The Royals.\" It did not depict an actual event, nor was the naked male seen in the video a child.\nOrigin\nA video posted to the \"Covert Geopolitics\" YouTube channel in November 2019 purported to capture a \"fully naked 'Filipino looking child' escaping from a window of the Buckingham Palace in the middle of the day.\" The clip was accompanied by a voice-over narration that consisted of a long diatribe about \"pedophiles\" and \"Satanists.\" Our partial transcript below gives a general idea of what the narrator tried to convey (minus the profanity):\nThis is how disturbing your world really is. I've been holding on to this footage for way too long. Every time I decide to post it, they take it down.\n[...]\nWhat's up? I mean, the top floor [of] Buckingham Palace ... just a naked-looking Filipino kid, you know, tied a whole bunch of sheets together just ... just for the heck of it. Yeah, that's it. Just for the heck of it. He's willing to try to escape naked, leap out of that floor, while a parade is going by. What has happened to that kid that he's willing to do that? Imagine that.\nThis kid looks like he falls to death here in about 10 seconds. This is what you are deciding to not listen to and not understand, on everything that I've been trying to tell you what's going on in the world. Your world is run by Satanists, and these are their victims, and we seem to think that it's just funny and okay. That's [expletive] sad. The world you live in people, controlled by pedophiles.\n[...]\nHowever, neither the video clip nor the description of it offered by \"Covert Geopolitics\" was real. The \"Covert Geopolitics\" version of the clip was actually a slowed-down, looped, lower-resolution version of a video  purportedly captured by a tourist in London  that prompted a good deal of consternation and speculation when it mysteriously appeared online in February 2015. The Mirror wrote:\nThis extraordinary video clip appears to show a man scaling Buckingham Palace  completely nude.\nThe shocking clip was posted on YouTube earlier today and has so far been watched by more than 500 people.\nIt appears to show a man climbing down from a window before falling spectacularly.\nThe incident was captured by bystanders standing over the road from the royal residence.\nIt is not known whether the man was injured in the apparent fall.\nIt's also not clear whether the clip is a hoax, but we will bring you more details as we get them.\nA spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the video.\nThat clip, in turn, was a stealth promotion created for the upcoming premiere of the E! Entertainment television series \"The Royals,\" a \"drama about a fictional British Royal family who inhabit a world of luxury and regal tradition that also involves intrigue and unexpected twists, revealing the complexities faced by royals trying to maintain high-profile relationships under scrutiny.\" From the E! Online website:\nThe [naked guy] video made headlines when it was uploaded from what seemed to be a tourist's YouTube channel while visiting Buckingham Palace during the changing of the guard.\nIn the video, an almost completely naked man (minus a sock) was seen climbing down a bed sheet, on the side of the palace from a window. Blogs and news agencies from Daily Mail to Cosmopolitan covered the video not knowing whether it was real or fake while users took to the comments to share their opinions.\nBut now, we have answers. With the \"exclusive, never-before-seen extended footage of the scandal\" from D-Throned, an online tabloid covering E!'s fictional modern day royal family from \"The Royals,\" it's clear that this was a clever way for E! to give viewers a glimpse of the drama that will go down on the upcoming premiere season of the new show.\nIn the full tabloid video, viewers see that the naked man was actually escaping from Princess Eleanor's (Alexandra Park) chambers, once again putting her back into the spotlight. \"The renegade royal has been spotted dancing wildly at a late night club and snogging at least one member of the cabinet,\" the narrator explains.\nThe full video can be viewed on Vimeo.\nThe promotional strategy was conceived by the advertising company Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), which also created a short video asserting bragging rights over its worldwide success. Producer SF Hartley did the same.\nWhatever activities the satanists of the world might be up to, producing viral commercials for cable television dramas is probably not among them.\nSources:\ndthronednews.

The external check acknowledges the plausibility of the story's core element—a goose sheltering a puppy from cold—but notes the lack of verifiable details.  The external check highlights the story's potential for exaggeration and the common nature of heartwarming animal rescue narratives in viral content.  The phrase \"surprise is capital\" is vague and doesn't offer any concrete information. Both checks agree on the lack of evidence supporting the specific details provided in the caption, such as the location and the man's involvement.  The external check's higher confidence score (7) is primarily attributed to the plausibility of the core event, while the lower confidence score of the internal check (0) stems from the direct contradiction of essential contextual elements. Because the image lacks these crucial contextual details, and both internal and external checks confirm that this information is missing and potentially inaccurate, we conclude that the caption is out of context.  The confidence score of 4 reflects the uncertainty regarding the underlying event, but the strong consensus regarding the lack of supporting evidence in the image and the implausibility of the stated context leads to the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",

Both internal and external validation checks support the plausibility of this claim. The internal check gives a confidence score of 10, noting the image's alignment with the description: an elephant sculpture in a park-like setting on a foggy day, consistent with a park in Glasgow. While the photographer's name isn't visibly present, it's considered plausible. The external check provides a confidence score of 8, confirming Bellahouston Park's existence in Glasgow and the plausibility of an elephant sculpture and foggy weather in the location.  It acknowledges the need for external verification to confirm the specific sculpture and photograph, but finds no inherent contradictions. The high confidence scores from both checks, combined with the lack of any significant discrepancies, strongly suggest that the caption is not out of context.  The explanation from the external check highlights supporting points such as the existence of Bellahouston Park, the common occurrence of elephant sculptures in parks, the likelihood of fog in Glasgow, and the plausibility of \"Bryce Wilson\" as a photographer. These supporting points further bolster the overall confidence in the caption's accuracy. There's no evidence to contradict the claim; the only limitation is the absence of absolute proof regarding the specific sculpture and photograph without further investigation. Therefore, while we cannot definitively confirm the exact photo, the available evidence overwhelmingly points toward the caption being in context. The combined confidence score of 9 reflects this strong likelihood, acknowledging the slight uncertainty due to the lack of definitive external confirmation on the specific sculpture and photographer.",

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isnt how vice presidential succession works.\nThe post got the first piece right: If the president is impeached, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated, the vice president becomes president.\n\"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President,\" reads the U.S. Constitution.\nThis has happened throughout American history. When President Abraham Lincoln died, his vice president, Andrew Johnson, became president. When President William McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt took his place.\nBut if the vice president becomes president, then what happens to the empty vice presidential slot? Its not surprising people would be confused by this question. For much of American history, the government didnt have much of an answer. The vice president simply wasnt replaced because a process wasnt codified in the Constitution.\n\"Our Constitution's framers created the vice presidency almost as an afterthought,\" explains the U.S. Senate website. \"The 20th century began without a vice president. Vice President Garret Hobart had died in November 1899, leaving the office vacant, as it had been on 10 previous occasions for periods ranging from a few months to nearly four years. The nation had gotten along just fine. No one much noticed Hobarts absence.\"\nBut that changed as time went on.\n\"The absence of any provision for filling a vice-presidential vacancy had become intolerable in the modern era,\" continues the U.S. Senate website.\nSo after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. According to the new amendment, if a vice presidential vacancy opens up, the president can nominate a replacement.\n\"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress,\" reads the 25th Amendment.\nThis rule was first put into practice in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Richard Nixon was president at the time, and he nominated Gerald R. Ford to take over the role. The House and Senate confirmed the nomination, and Ford took office. When Nixon resigned the next year, Ford became president and nominated Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president.\nSo if Biden became president and left office early, Kamala Harris would indeed become the new president.\nBut Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, wouldnt become vice president. Instead, Harris would choose the new vice president, and the House and Senate would vote on her choice.\nThe poster may be confused by the Presidential Succession Act, which says that if both the president and vice president die or are incapacitated, the speaker of the House is next in line to become president. Some people believe the Presidential Succession Act is unconstitutional, but thats for another day.\nThis post rates False.",

However, the external check, while not disproving the caption, expresses lower confidence (7) due to the lack of readily available public information confirming the implementation of a facial recognition system at the school.  The discrepancy stems from the fact that the image provides visual confirmation of the school's location, but the claim about facial recognition technology requires external verification which is unavailable from the given context.  The external check acknowledges the plausibility of schools using facial recognition but emphasizes the need for independent evidence.  The image shows only the building's exterior and provides no information about security measures. Therefore, while the image is accurately identified, the claim about the facial recognition system lacks the necessary supporting evidence.  The higher confidence from the internal check is focused solely on the image itself (location and school identity) and does not address the claim concerning the technology.  The external check is more concerned with the unverifiable nature of that claim.  We are heavily influenced by the external check in this scenario because the core claim of the caption is that Lockport High School uses facial recognition.  The lack of external verification for this specific claim makes the caption potentially out of context despite its visual accuracy. Because there is no supporting evidence for the facial recognition aspect of the caption, and such evidence is needed to support the caption's primary assertion, we conclude that the caption is out of context given the existing evidence. In short, the image shows Lockport High School, but that doesn't mean it uses facial recognition.  The external check appropriately highlights this critical distinction.",

The uncertainty stems from the lack of verifiable sources supporting the specific claim of a bird feeding on ticks from a stag's fur in Bristol, UK. Although stags hosting ticks and birds feeding on ticks from mammals are common occurrences and the location is geographically plausible, this particular event isn't definitively confirmed. The image shows a stag and birds, but the exact interaction remains ambiguous without further supporting evidence.

If a picture has been photoshopped, it's unlikely you'll find multiple pictures of the object from different angles. Surprisingly, we found an additional photograph of this SnAK-47, which indicates that this is a physical object, not a digitally created one:\nWhile these pictures appear to document a physical object, this \"snake\" is not real. For one, it seems unlikely that a snake's body would wrap so tightly around the angular shape of this gun. If a snake did eat an AK-47, its body would stretch from one protuberance to another, creating a more rounded shape.\nSo if this picture isn't photoshopped, and if this physical object isn't a real snake, what exactly does it show?\nIt shows art work created by Vasily Slonov, a Russian political artist, called \"Python-AK.\" According to Artsy.net, this art is made of rubber and was created in 2019.",

The description \"A photograph shows a snake after it swallowed an AK-47\" aligns well with this visual interpretation at a superficial level.

Snopes explicitly identifies the image as a work of art, \"Python-AK\" by Vasily Slonov, and not a real snake that ingested a gun. This external validation carries significant weight, as it's based on a reputable fact-checking source that investigated the image's origin and context.  The conflict between the internal and external checks necessitates a careful analysis. The internal check's high confidence stems from a straightforward visual interpretation of the image; however, it lacks the broader contextual information that the external check provides.  The external check's lower confidence score might be due to the fact that it relies on external sources, and the confidence reflects the uncertainty inherent in relying on external information.  The significant discrepancy highlights the importance of corroborating visual interpretations with reliable external sources. Given the substantial evidence from Snopes, which directly addresses the image's origin and nature, the caption is deemed out of context.

            "content": "On May 27, 1937, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge opened, connecting bustling San Francisco to sleepy Marin County to the north. The Oakland-Bay Bridge had opened six months earlier  but the Golden Gate was an engineering triumph. It straddles the Golden Gate Strait, the passage from the Pacific Ocean into the San Francisco Bay, where rough currents prevail and winds can reach 70 mph.\nThe bridge's opening day was strictly for pedestrians. The day was typical for May in San Francisco: foggy, windy and cold. That didn't stop 200,000 people from crossing the bridge. Many walked. Others ran, tap-danced, roller-skated, unicycled or strode on stilts.\nThe night before the bridge opened, 16-year-old Edgar Stone and two high school friends finished watching a movie in a San Francisco theater. They decided to head to the bridge and be the first in line to cross.\nThey hung out all night, unable to sleep. Come morning, they trotted across the almost 2-mile span. When they got to the other side, the three teens collapsed on a railing to rest.\n\"We thought if we got lucky, we might get our picture in the paper,\" says Stone, who's now 91. And they did get lucky: A photographer from the News-Call Bulletin snapped the three teens leaning into each other, eyes closed.\n\"We were truly tired, although we were putting on a bit of show,\" Stone says. Besides the exhaustion, Stone remembers being above the San Francisco Bay for the first time and how far down the water appeared. \"Kind of a little frightening to look over,\" he recalls.\nNancy Kent Danielson, 85, had the same feeling as she saw the vast ocean on one side of the railing and the bay on the other. She was only 11 when she crossed the bridge on opening day with her parents and twin sister, Martye.\n\"But I was looking at people's waists,\" she says. \"I did notice that the roadway rose under our feet, that we were going uphill, and that took us all the way to the middle of the bridge before it leveled off, and then we could go down a bit.\"\nWhen it opened, the Golden Gate was the longest suspension bridge in the world. And it helped the city grow  but not everyone liked the idea.\n\"My father had a friend who thought the worst crime in the world would be to put a bridge there and spoil the beauty of nature,\" Danielson says.\nThe Marin Garden Club, where Danielson's mother was a member, even wrote letters in protest of the bridge's unusual color. \"They didn't think it should be anything but silver,\" she says.\n\"We suspected the bridge was going up just so it could ruin Marin County,\" she says. Marin residents were bracing for saloons and quick-food stands. And that's just what happened, Danielson says. With a laugh, she adds, \"I love people, but there are too many of us!\"\nLola Silvestri, 90, remembers reading about the building of the bridge practically every day in the newspaper.\n\"They only hired single men because of the danger,\" says Silvestri, who was 16 on opening day. \"We started out on the bridge as strangers,\" she says. \"By the time we got to the other side, we knew everybody.\"\nAt the bridge's last tower, Silvestri met a bridge worker who showed the teenager and her friend where he cemented in a dime. \"I was thinking about that the other day,\" she says. \"It was the end of the Great Depression, and there was the song 'Brother Can You Spare a Dime'  and I was wondering, what could you buy for a dime today?\"\nGeorge Klein, 95, was 20 when the bridge opened. It was cold, and he was wearing shorts. A former high school track star, he hoped to be the first to cross from the north end of the bridge in Marin.\n\"I ran all the way to the other side, but I couldn't find any officials,\" says Klein. So, he just turned around and jogged back.\nWhat Klein or anyone could foresee was that the Golden Gate Bridge was destined to become a global tourist attraction. Back then, it was a symbol of progress even during hard times. And before the bridges, the only way to get around the bay was by ferry.\nBut the ferry had its advantages, Klein says.\n\"I could take a train, then a ferry, and then take another ferry and then a train and make it to downtown Oakland in an hour and five minutes,\" he says. \"And I defy you to do that today with the bridges  that's how things have changed.\"\nThe ferries still run today  they're popular with tourists and some commuters. Their decks provide an open view of the landscape and the Golden Gate Bridge, now 75 years old.\nBack on the bridge's opening day, its chief engineer, Joseph Strauss, read aloud a poem he wrote at nearby Crissy Field:",

Although it no longer holds claim to either of those titles (Japan's Akashi Kaiky Bridge exceeds it in both respects), the Golden Gate Bridge remains one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, is one of the most-photographed structures on Earth, and stands as a globally recognized symbol of one American city.\nAs reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, the official opening of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937 was a huge event that spanned nine days of celebrations, with two separate opening days  one for pedestrians and one for cars  drawing hundreds of thousands of bridge-crossers:\nExcitement was so high for the bridge that the Golden Gate Fiesta included nine days of celebrations, and not one opening day but two. The first opening day, May 27, 1937, was limited to pedestrians.\nThe organizing committee estimated that 100,000 people would take advantage of the opportunity to stroll across the bridge without interference from cars, but they seriously underestimated the appeal. From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. that day, more than 200,000 flocked to the bridge for a chance to say they walked across.\nThe next day cars were allowed on the bridge. Precisely at 11 a.m. May 28, dozens of U.S. Navy planes would fly over the Golden Gate Bridge, followed by Navy ships of all sizes  three aircraft carriers, 13 heavy cruisers, six light cruisers and six destroyers  passing underneath the bridge.\nIn recent years, a photograph said to depict that (first) opening day in 1937 has frequently been shared online with the caption \"The Golden Gate Bridge opening to the public for the first time back in 1937, and yes, it almost collapsed\":\nBut this picture doesn't date from 1937, nor did we find any contemporaneous accounts stating that the Golden Gate Bridge \"almost collapsed\" at that time. Although this photograph is displayed in black-and-white and therefore looks fairly \"old\" to modern eyes, it was actually taken in 1987, when an estimated 300,000 people swarmed the bridge during its golden anniversary celebration.\nThe original image was captioned as follows: \"Shot from the South Tower facing south down onto the roadway overlooking a mass of people at the 50th anniversary celebration for the Golden Gate Bridge.\"\nThe crush of pedestrians who crossed the bridge that day in 1987 did cause it to sag about 7 feet at its mid-section, and some onlookers did fear at the time that the structure was in danger of buckling, but engineers maintained that the combined load was well within the bridge's capacity:\nOn May 24, 1987, 300,000 people were stuck in human gridlock for hours while getting a rare chance to cross the 1.7-mile bridge en masse on foot to celebrate the bridges golden anniversary. Officials quickly closed the bridge, so a half-million other people waiting to cross never got the chance. Still, the enormous, unprecedented weight caused the middle of the bridge to sag 7 feet.\nIm grateful because if the others had gotten out there, maybe the bridge would have fallen down, Gary Giacomini, then president of the bridge districts board, told The Associated Press at the time.\nBut engineers said afterward that the bridge was never in danger of collapsing.\nIndependent engineers agree[d] ... that structurally the bridge was safe during the Golden Gates last big celebration.\nIt was probably the biggest load the bridge had ever seen, said Mark Ketchum, a San Francisco bridge engineer who studied the Golden Gate Bridge from 1989 to 1991. But it did not exceed the design load capacity of the bridge.\nOn fully loaded suspension bridges the size of the Golden Gate, its normal to have deflections of up to 10 feet, said Greg Deierlein, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering.",

External sources indicate that the image actually depicts the bridge's 50th-anniversary celebration in 1987, and that while a slight sag occurred then, there was no danger of collapse. The conflict arises from the caption's claim that the bridge almost collapsed in 1937, a claim unsupported by external evidence. Because the external evidence is substantial and points toward the claim being false,  we must prioritize it over the internal assessment, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The external evidence directly refutes a key part of the caption, reducing our overall confidence slightly from a perfect 10 to 8, as there was initially strong visual confirmation of the bridge in 1937 from the internal check.  The core of the discrepancy lies in the temporal aspect and the claim of near-collapse. The external source's assertion that no contemporaneous accounts support such a near-collapse during the 1937 opening significantly undermines the caption's claim. Therefore, given the preponderance of evidence from external sources, we can confidently declare the caption to be out of context.",

The lack of explicit mention of Wisconsin in the signs themselves is a key factor lowering the confidence score.  The fact that both internal and external validation highlight the absence of explicit Wisconsin mention necessitates caution and adjustment in the confidence score.  The internal validation's higher score is largely because the image itself is very clearly of a gerrymandering protest outside the Supreme Court. The external validation's lower score comes from the inability to definitively confirm the protest relates to Wisconsin based on readily available information.

Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

It concludes that the caption is accurate because it reflects a common concern related to child safety regulations. However, this assessment lacks crucial external verification. The external check reveals that the caption is a widely circulated misinformation meme debunked by fact-checking websites. This meme falsely claims a specific date (December 2016) for a ban on backless booster seats for children under 12, specifically in the US context. The meme's origin is unclear, and the claim is inaccurate.  While some countries may have regulations regarding backless booster seat usage, the specified date and claim's universality across jurisdictions is not supported by evidence. Therefore, a crucial discrepancy exists between the internal and external validation results. The external validation, supported by fact-checking resources, carries more weight due to its comprehensive investigation and verification process.  The internal assessment, while seemingly plausible given the image, is flawed due to its limited scope and lack of access to reliable regulatory information. The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong evidence from the external validation and the clear contradiction with the internal assessment.  The external evidence demonstrates that the statement in the caption is fundamentally incorrect, not simply outdated.  The image, while seemingly relatable to the topic of child car seat safety, is insufficient to validate the misinformation presented in the caption. In summary, the caption is out of context because it propagates a false claim about child car seat regulations.",

It validates Tulsi Gabbard's political positions as described, confirming the plausibility of her views appealing to a segment of progressive Democrats.  However, it flags the need for verification regarding her presence at the Capitol \"this month.\"  This is a crucial detail, as the caption implies a recent event.\n\nThe discrepancy lies in the level of certainty around the temporal aspect. The internal check confidently identifies the subject and setting, while the external check underscores the need for time-specific evidence.  To resolve this, we should consult external sources such as news articles, official congressional records, or Tulsi Gabbard's public schedule to confirm whether she was indeed at the Capitol during the month the caption implies.\n\nWithout this verification, the confidence score is slightly lowered from a perfect 10. However, given the strong internal consistency and the substantial external plausibility regarding Gabbard's political stances and the likelihood of her being in the Capitol, the overall assessment remains favorable. The plausibility of the main components of the caption is high, and the time-specific detail needs further corroboration.  This brings the final score to 9, reflecting the high probability of the caption's accuracy, contingent on confirmation of the temporal element. \n\nEntity analysis aligns well with both internal and external validation.  Representative Tulsi Gabbard is correctly identified, and the context of the Capitol is well-supported by visual evidence.  The external check provides additional context on her political positions, corroborating the claim's plausibility.\n\nIn conclusion, although the external check highlights the need for additional temporal evidence, the strong internal consistency, alongside the plausible external information about Gabbard's political stance, provides enough confidence to conclude that the caption is not out of context. The overall assessment incorporates a slightly conservative judgment, reflecting the uncertainty stemming from the lack of definite temporal confirmation.",

Apparently, she didn't stay too long at her rally location at the Pompano Beach Amphitheater. Clinton almost melted at the sight of Trump signs surrounding her and people yelling \"Lock Her Up!\". A police escort shared what happened:\nThe photograph from the New York Times is real, and does show Clinton with a crowd of people (some of whom were holding Trump/Pence signs) in Pompano Beach, Florida. It is also evidence that the message posted by \"Salty Dad,\" claiming that Clinton \"refused to exit her vehicle,\" is inaccurate.\nOn 30 October 2016, Clinton spent much of the day touring Broward County. According to the caption on the New York Times photograph, her Pompano Beach visit was an impromptu stop to greet a group of early voters:\nThe Sun-Sentinel noted that the visit occurred outside the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center, not the Pompano Beach Amphitheater (where she was not scheduled to host a rally to begin with) and that while a few people chanted \"lock her up,\" it didn't stop Clinton from taking a few selfies with supporters:\nShe also traveled to Pompano Beach to visit people outside the early voting site at the Emma Lou Olson Civic Center. Jennie Jones, of Pompano Beach, took a selfie with Clinton, which she said she couldn't wait to show her grandchildren.\n\"She's the next president of the United States,\" said Betty Nesbitt of Fort Lauderdale, who yelled \"I love you Hillary\" to her candidate.\nAbout a half dozen Trump supporters who were at the early voting site holding signs for their candidate got a chance to express a different view. \"Lock her up,\" yelled Gary Moss, of Pompano Beach.",

The high confidence score of the external check (8) combined with the lower confidence of the internal check (10) and the direct contradiction between them results in a final verdict that the caption is out of context. The Snopes article offers compelling evidence, including photographic proof and event reports, which significantly outweighs the less precise internal assessment.  The internal check primarily focused on visual entity alignment rather than factual accuracy.  While the image does show Clinton at a seemingly large public event, the caption's specific claim regarding her refusal to exit her vehicle and the reason behind it is unequivocally refuted by the external source. The discrepancy arises because the internal check only evaluates the presence of entities within the image, not the narrative accuracy of the caption.  The external check, however, investigates the claim's veracity using independent reporting and evidence.  Therefore, the external check's findings hold more weight. Given the strong contradictory evidence provided by Snopes, the confidence score is set at 9 out of 10, reflecting a high degree of certainty that the caption is out of context.",

The slight difference in confidence scores reflects the fact that the internal check can directly assess the image-caption alignment more confidently than the external check can verify the specifics of school reopening dates and locations. However, since both checks find strong support for the caption, a high overall confidence score is justified.  There's no direct evidence to contradict any part of the caption.  The lack of explicit identification of the school and date in the image doesn't invalidate the caption, as these details are commonly included in journalistic captions and do not affect the visual content's representation.

The internal check gives high confidence (10) due to the clear visual evidence of a coffin being carried by individuals in a setting that suggests a possible health crisis. The protective gear worn by the carriers further strengthens this interpretation. The external check provides a confidence score of 8.  The external check acknowledges the plausible link between the image and the caption, noting that Ebola victims are often buried in coffins to prevent the disease's spread. However, it correctly points out the lack of definitive contextual information. The absence of explicit confirmation that the death was indeed caused by Ebola is the reason for the slightly lower external confidence score. There are no major discrepancies between the internal and external validation processes. Both recognize the visual elements strongly supporting the caption, but the external check remains cautious due to the lack of explicit confirmation of the cause of death. This cautious approach is justified. The visual evidence aligns with the caption, making it highly probable that it's an accurate representation of the event. The slightly lower score from the external check acknowledges that while the caption is very likely true based on the visuals, it is not absolutely certain without further contextual details.  The absence of contradictory information or alternative interpretations from either internal or external checks leads to a high overall confidence score of 9.  The image strongly suggests the coffin contains an Ebola victim, given the protective clothing and the overall context of the scene.  While external sources are unable to independently verify the cause of death in this specific case, they confirm the general practice of burying Ebola victims in coffins.  The combined evidence strongly supports the caption's accuracy.",

External verification would require consulting news reports or official records linking the individual in the picture to a crime. The external check plausibly allows the possibility of such a person existing, but it emphasizes the lack of evidence to support the original claim. Both internal and external validation agree that the caption is likely out of context because it asserts a fact (the man is a murderous taxi driver) that the image does not confirm and there is no supporting evidence in external sources. The conflict lies in the internal check focusing on the image content, which lacks information supporting or refuting the assertion, while the external check examines the claim's plausibility based on broader knowledge. However, this plausibility is low due to a lack of evidence, leading to a combined verdict of OOC. The confidence score is moderate (6) as the absence of evidence does not constitute evidence of absence.  More evidence would be needed to definitively conclude that the caption is entirely false.

My son gave me a potted plant for my birthday. I kept it on my kitchen counter until this week when it was warm enough to plant outside.\nI took it out to plant and tried to get it out of the pot with no luck. So I wet it really well, and the plant came out. It was in a decorative glass container with no holes in it and had a plastic pot cut and wedged into the glass pot. After I planted the flower, I tried to get the plastic pot out of the glass one by wedging a knife around the sides. When I did this, something moved. It looked like a snake, so I called my son outside. He took the liner out, and to our surprise, we found not one snake, but two baby copper heads!\nI almost died! I've been upset since then. When we took the plastic pot from the glass one, there was a piece of card board along the side. We think there must have been eggs in the holes of the cardboard at the grower's nursery. They must have hatched later.\nI am sending you pictures. Take my advice, and don't bring plants inside. This could have been really  really bad. This plant was bought at the grocery store. I will not give the name of the store, because I don't want to ruin their business. I'm sure it wasn't anything they knew about. It's the grower that should be more careful in potting these plants. I just want to warn you guys not to bring plants inside. Who knows what could be lurking under those roots? I am only thankful this was not a plant to be kept inside.\nThe lack of any identifying details about when, where, and under what circumstances these e-mailed photographs were taken makes their accompanying back story difficult to verify and leaves open the possibility that (as often happens) they were simply innocuous pictures to which someone else added a sensational (and fabricated) narrative to explain their origins. (Some versions of the message open with the statement \"This happened here, Columbus, MS!!\" but that line appears to be a later addition to the text.)\nEither way, we can make a few general points about what's described here:\nIt isn't unusual for snakes (venomous or otherwise) to occasionally turn up in consumer products and packaging (or in the stores that sell them), particularly at outlets that vend imported produce or gardening and nursery supplies (although sometimes such discoveries are more likely attributable to pranksters than to Mother Nature).\nRoughly speaking, only about 5% of the snake species found in the U.S. are venomous, so the average encounter with a snake is unlikely to result in any harm to humans.",

        "explanation": "The original caption claims that the photograph depicts Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and his mother dressed in KKK garb. Both internal and external validation checks strongly refute this claim. \n\nInternal validation: The image shows two individuals, one adult and one child, wearing KKK-style robes.  However, there is no visual resemblance to Governor Brian Kemp or any indication that the individuals depicted are Brian Kemp and his mother. The claim is internally inconsistent as the photograph's content does not align with the entities named in the caption. The confidence score of 0 reflects the complete lack of supporting evidence within the image itself.\n\nExternal validation:  An external check with Snopes definitively debunks the caption's claim. Snopes reports the photograph is miscaptioned and the identities of the individuals are unknown. Moreover, Snopes highlights that the photograph's date (1956) predates Brian Kemp's birth (1963), conclusively proving that it is impossible for him to be depicted in the image.  This strong external evidence, with a confidence score of 10, decisively refutes the caption.\n\nDiscrepancy Analysis: There is no conflict between the internal and external validation checks. Both independently confirm that the caption is factually incorrect and out of context.  The external validation, specifically Snopes's analysis and factual verification of the photograph's date, is particularly compelling. The high confidence score from both checks corroborates the conclusion.\n\nEntity Analysis: The caption mentions specific entities—Brian Kemp and his mother.  The image itself contains no verifiable evidence to support the connection between these entities and the individuals depicted. The complete absence of any visual or contextual clues supports the assertion that the caption is inaccurate.\n\nConclusion: Based on both the image analysis (internal validation) and the external fact-checking by Snopes, the caption is definitively out of context. The high concordance between the internal (0) and external (10) confidence scores yields a final confidence score of 10, reflecting the extremely high certainty in the assessment.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly reject the caption's claim.  Internal analysis finds no visual evidence to support the caption's assertion, while external verification by Snopes definitively disproves the claim through factual evidence (photograph date predating Kemp's birth). The combination of these independent analyses leaves no doubt that the caption is entirely inaccurate and out of context."

The internal check highlights the strong visual alignment: the image clearly shows Steven Mnuchin, aligning with the caption's claim. The context – Mnuchin's formal attire and the presence of security personnel – strongly suggests an official setting, consistent with a congressional hearing. The internal check's high confidence (10) is well-justified. The external check, while acknowledging the need for verification of the specific date of the hearing, points out that such events are common occurrences. Its confidence is slightly lower (8) due to the inability to definitively confirm the date, but the underlying plausibility – the routine nature of congressional oversight and Mnuchin's past role as Treasury Secretary – provides substantial support.  The convergence of these checks, both pointing towards the caption's veracity, leads to a high overall confidence score. There are no significant discrepancies; both checks agree that the image and the caption are reasonably aligned.  The external check's suggestion to verify the date against news reports from the relevant timeframe is a prudent recommendation for increasing certainty. However, the lack of conflicting information or strong contradictory evidence supports the overall conclusion that the caption accurately describes the image's content. The absence of explicit visual evidence of 'House Democrats' and 'Congress' is not considered a major flaw; these entities are implied by the context of the image.",

Murray, who left public life a few years ago to pursue a more conservative lifestyle, found out he was dying about three months ago but decided not to make a big deal out of it.\nAccording to his spokesman and lawyer, Art Tubolls, Murray left very simple instructions for his passing:\nBill wanted to see America unite under President Trump and come together to fight against all the things hes fought against his entire career. When he wrote the movie Ghostbusters he used Slimer as an example of how feeding something causes dependence. Stripes was to teach the average American that anyone can be a hero if the timing is right.\nNone of this was true: at the time this report was published, Bill Murray was still very much alive and only 68 years old. The report of his death was another fabrication by Conservative Tears, a site which is part of the America's Last Line of Defense network of websites and Facebook pages that pump out a steady stream of inflammatory and politically divisive misinformation under the guise of proffering \"satire.\"",

While neither provides conclusive proof, the alignment between both checks' findings at a confidence score of 8 strongly suggests the caption accurately reflects the image content.  The absence of explicit mention of \"Kinshasa\" in the image itself is balanced by the overall context provided by the visible tallying process, an election worker, and the African-style setting.

However, the external check provides compelling evidence contradicting this assessment.  The external check cites a source explicitly stating that the image is not a photograph taken from the ISS but rather a 3D visualization created from NASA satellite data. This source directly refutes the caption's claim.  The high confidence score from both internal and external checks highlights a significant discrepancy.  The external check's evidence—a direct statement from the image creator and corroboration from another source—is more reliable than an inference based solely on visual interpretation. The visual plausibility of the image is not sufficient to outweigh the explicit statement that it is a 3D rendering, not an ISS photograph.  Therefore, the caption is determined to be out of context because it misrepresents the image's origin. The visual representation of the bushfires is accurate, but the claim about its source (the ISS) is demonstrably false. This is a critical distinction, emphasizing the importance of verifying image sources beyond visual assessment. In this case, the external evidence strongly and reliably indicates that the image's source is not the International Space Station as claimed in the caption.",

(These later variants also incorporated photographs of ice formations claimed to have originated in Lake Huron, likewise mistakenly placing the pictures half a world away from their actual source.)\nThese striking pictures of icebergs with multi-colored stripes or banding were taken by a Norwegian sailor named Oyvind Tangen while he was aboard a research ship about 1,700 miles south of Cape Town, South Africa:\nExamples:\nICEBERG PICTURES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN\nFrozen Wave Pixs - Nature is amazing!\nThe water froze the instant the wave broke through the ice. That's what it is like in Lake Michigan where it is the coldest weather in decades. Water freezes the instant it comes in contact with the air...\nThe temperature of the water is already some degrees below freezing. Just look at how the wave froze in mid-air!!!\nNow, that is cold!!!\nAmazing striped icebergs\nIcebergs in the Antarctic area sometimes have stripes, formed by layers of snow that react to different conditions.\nBlue stripes are often created when a crevice in the ice sheet fills up with melt water and freezes so quickly that no bubbles form.\nWhen an iceberg falls into the sea, a layer of salty seawater can freeze to the underside. If this is rich in algae, it can form a green stripe.\nBrown, black and yellow lines are caused by sediment, picked up when the ice sheet grinds downhill towards the sea.\nAs the London Times reported of the processes that created the striations displayed in these unusual candy-striped icebergs:\nKeith Makinson, of the British Antarctic Survey, said that icebergs that seemed to show stripes were quite common in southern waters, but it was the first time that he had seen brown stripes. They are believed to be created when ice crystals form under the water and, in a process described as \"inverted snow\", rise to stick to the bottom of the ice shelf. As the ice crystals form a new layer at the bottom of the ice shelf, which later fragments to float away as icebergs, tiny particles of organic matter are trapped.Parts of dead marine creatures such as krill form much of the trapped material and have the effect of creating coloured stripes, mainly blues and greens, in icebergs. Dr Makinson said that the brown stripes in this example were likely to have been formed from sediment washing underneath the ice shelf.",

            "content": "The heat is unrelenting in the middle of a December day in eastern Sudan. It's hard to find any shade in this arid landscape. It's mostly dust and boulders  and, for now at least, it is the temporary home of tens of thousands of Ethiopian refugees who have crossed the border to flee the fighting in their country.\nThere's not much to make a home. The nearest town, Al Qadarif, is two hours away. No water source exists at the camps, so water is trucked in from miles away through rugged roads. Refugees are sleeping in makeshift tents and in abandoned buildings. Some are even sleeping outside with no shelter.\nLast month, the Ethiopian government launched a military offensive against a rebellious regional government. The ensuing conflict has killed hundreds, and almost 50,000 Ethiopians have crossed the country's northwestern border into Sudan. It's a refugee crisis that is straining the humanitarian infrastructure in the country. The United Nations refugee agency has appealed for $150 million to help cope with the situation.\nAt Village 8 Camp, Measho Fishale, 34, is trying to make a stew out of the sorghum that humanitarian groups have been handing out. It isn't really working. All she can do is stand above the stove in the sun, holding her toddler.\nShe has seven children, but when the fighting started in the town of Mai-Kadra in early November, her two oldest were not at home.\n\"[Militias] were slaughtering people with knives and machetes,\" she says.\nMany other refugees describe the same scene: They say members of Fano, a youth militia loyal to the government, rampaged through Mai-Kadra killing ethnic Tigrayans. The government has repeatedly disputed that narrative, saying it was a youth militia affiliated with the Tigrayan rebels who killed ethnic Amharas, Ethiopia's second-biggest ethnic group.\nNPR could not independently corroborate the refugees' claims, but dozens of them told the same story.\nMeasho says she had no choice but to run immediately. She has looked for the two children she left behind in Ethiopia, hoping they would have found their way to the camp, but she hasn't been able to find them.\nStanding next to Measho is 55-year-old Kidan Berhe. She wanted to stay home, despite the war and didn't think she could make the arduous walk through the bush into Sudan. But then armed men swept through the town, and she thought about her children having to return to look for her. She worried they would be killed as well, so she left everything and walked for hours toward Sudan.\n\"This is all I have,\" she says, pointing to her clothes. Tears well up in her eyes and she presses her hands against her face.\n\"My gold. My clothes. I have lost everything,\" she tells NPR.\nShe says she now feels safe in Sudan but worries about her future and about the bleak living conditions at the camps. Humanitarian workers are struggling to keep up with the flow of refugees and to build up an infrastructure to accommodate them.\nNadir Ibrahim, a local humanitarian worker, says the refugees \"need water; there are no latrines; they are doing open defecation.\" If this continues, he warns, disease will run rampant at these camps.\nRefugees are doing what they can with whatever they can. They're building shelter out of grass. They are trying to make injera  the traditional Ethiopian bread usually made from a grain called teff  from the sorghum that is given out by aid agencies.\nIn Ethiopia, the situation appears more severe. The United Nations has said that refugees in the Tigray Region have received no aid since conflict started. The more than 96,000 Eritrean refugees in Tigray, who have fled war and repression in the past two decades, the U.N. says, have run out of food rations. The U.N. has received reports that refugees are leaving camps because of violence.\nEthiopia and the U.N. had reached an agreement giving aid groups access to the Tigray Region, but last week, the Ethiopian military shot at a U.N. convoy and the government warned it did not need a \"babysitter.\" On Friday, the International Rescue Committee said one of its staff members had been killed at a camp in Tigray.\nEthiopia has said that the military operation in the country is over, because it has taken control of the Tigray Region capital, Mekelle. But the Tigray People's Liberation Front says it will not surrender to what it considers an invading army, and fighting has continued on many fronts.\nThe war is a power struggle between Ethiopia's new government and its old one; it's about what the Ethiopian political system will look like in the future. But in interviews with refugees, the war is about loss. Everyone, no matter which side they're on, is mourning. Some have lost loved ones; many others have lost homes. And every inch of the refugee camps in Sudan has become about grasping at some semblance of what they had before the war.\nAt the Um Rakuba camp, Fitsum Kidanemariam, 25, says he left his parents back in Ethiopia. He hasn't been able to call them, so he doesn't know their fate.\nHe's a slim young man and his voice breaks as he explains his situation. Back home, his love was art, but he had to work in construction because, like anywhere in the world, \"there is no money in art,\" he says.\nHe walks past a huge tent filled with sacks of sorghum, past a little hut where women sell coffee. He enters what looked like an abandoned schoolhouse. It's just a shell now  most of the windows are broken; there are no doors; the paint is peeling. His friends play cards on the floor. On the windowsill, just behind them, he has lined up seven sculptures that he made out of rocks he found in the camp.\nOn one of them, he carved the face of a woman on one side and the face of a lion on the other.\n\"The woman is forgiving and respectful,\" he says. \"The lion, like warring men, will lash out at the slightest touch.\"\nFitsum sculpts every day. For hours, he meticulously carves rocks using a piece of steel he found at the camp. He's trying to forget the violence, hoping that his parents are still alive. He says he spent hours sculpting this rock, dreaming of a different life where humans were less like lions.",

            "content": "Uganda's long-time President Yoweri Museveni has been re-elected, electoral officials say, amid accusations of vote fraud by his main rival Bobi Wine.\nMr Museveni won almost 59% of the vote, with Bobi Wine trailing with about 35%, the Electoral Commission said.\nThursday's poll may turn out to be the \"most cheating-free\" in the history of the African nation, the president said.\nBobi Wine, a former pop star, vowed to provide evidence of vote-rigging when internet connections were restored.\nThe government shut down the internet ahead of voting day, a move condemned by election monitors.\nThey said confidence in the count had been damaged by the days-long cut. A government minister told the BBC on Saturday evening that the internet service would be restored \"very soon\".\nIn a phone interview with the BBC World Service, Bobi Wine said he and his wife were not being allowed to leave their home by soldiers.\n\"Nobody is allowed to leave or come into our house. Also, all journalists - local and international - have been blocked from accessing me here at home,\" he said.\nDozens of people were killed during violence in the run-up to the election. Opposition politicians have also accused the government of harassment.\nThe result gives President Museveni a sixth term in office. The 76-year-old, in power since 1986, says he represents stability in the country.\nMeanwhile, Bobi Wine - the stage name for 38-year-old Robert Kyagulanyi - says he has the backing of the youth in one of the world's youngest nations, where the median age is 16.\nWhat's the latest on the election results?\n\"The electoral commission declares Yoweri Museveni... elected President of the Republic of Uganda,\" election commission chairman Justice Simon Mugenyi Byabakama said on Saturday.\nHe said turnout was 57% of the almost 18 million registered voters.\nEarlier, Mr Byabakama said the vote had been peaceful, and called on Bobi Wine to make public the evidence for his fraud allegations.\nThe opposition candidate earlier said: \"I will be happy to share the videos of all the fraud and irregularities as soon as the internet is restored.\"\nBut speaking after being declared the winner, Mr Museveni said: \"Voting by machines made sure there is no cheating.\n\"But we are going to audit and see how many people voted by fingerprints and how many of those voted by just using the register.\"\nMr Museveni also warned that \"foreign meddling will not be tolerated\".\nThe EU, United Nations and several rights groups have raised concerns. Aside from an African Union mission, no major international group monitored the vote.\nEarlier this week the US - a major aid donor to Uganda - cancelled its diplomatic observer mission to the country, saying that the majority of its staff had been denied permission to monitor polling sites.\nThe US state department said the vote occurred in \"an environment of intimidation of fear\".\nBobi Wine will continue to play a role\nBy Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Kampala\nPresident Yoweri Museveni has seen off countless challengers during his three decades in power - helped along by constitutional changes, which have allowed him to continue running for office.\nHis assurances of security and economic stability continue to win him votes. It's easy to underestimate how much the memories of decades of civil war and a failed state still cast a shadow over this country.\nBobi Wine rejects the results and says he will present evidence of rigging and voter intimidation. The opposition leader casts a lonely figure - in his home on the outskirts of Kampala.\nHis key advisers have either been arrested or are in hiding. Nevertheless, he will continue to play a key role in Uganda's politics.\nHis National Unity Platform is expected to be the biggest opposition party in parliament. What he says and does can inspire millions both in Uganda and across Africa where youthful political movements are taking hold.\nWho is Yoweri Museveni?\nMr Museveni, who came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986, stood as leader of the National Resistance Movement (NRM).\nHe has long been depicted to Ugandans as a liberator and peace bringer.\nBut he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and sidelining opponents, says the BBC's Patience Atuhaire.\nWho is Bobi Wine?",

The internal check gives a confidence score of 8, indicating a high degree of confidence in the image's context but low confidence in the statement about equipment age. The external check supports the presence of Indian paramilitary troops in Srinagar, aligning with the image content. However, it expresses lower confidence (score of 7) regarding the claim on the percentage of \"vintage\" equipment, emphasizing the need for a reliable source to verify this statistic.  The external check acknowledges the ongoing modernization efforts by the Indian military, suggesting the presence of older equipment is plausible, but the specific percentage (68%) requires further validation. Since the internal and external checks both agree on the troop location and the overall context while disagreeing on the quantifiable data about the equipment, we have a conflict that needs resolution. Considering that the image primarily depicts troops and their presence in Srinagar, the visual evidence strongly supports this aspect.  However, the statement about the equipment age is not directly supported by the image and needs external, verifiable source to confirm.  Since the claim about equipment age is an additional piece of information not visually evident in the image, we can safely separate the confirmed information (troop location and presence) from the unconfirmed information (equipment age). Therefore, based on the evidence, the caption is not entirely out of context because the core information represented in the image (paramilitary troops in Srinagar) is consistent. The lower confidence score reflects the uncertainty surrounding the claim about equipment age. This uncertainty is a direct outcome of the lack of verifiable evidence in the image itself and the need for additional reliable sources to confirm the external claim about vintage equipment. In conclusion, while the core caption aligns with the image's content, the lack of external verifiable evidence for the equipment age claim reduces the overall confidence score.",

        "explanation": "The caption \"Untitled 01, Coney Island, by Hugo de Melo, from the US\" aligns well with the image content. The internal check gives high confidence (10) because the image clearly depicts two women walking near an \"It'Sugar\" store in what is strongly suggested to be Coney Island. The presence of typical urban street scenes, architectural styles, and the store itself strongly support the Coney Island location. The photographer's name, \"Hugo de Melo,\" is not visible in the image, but this is a standard convention for image metadata and does not detract from the overall plausibility. The \"Untitled 01\" designation is also common for artworks, particularly in series. The image style and context strongly imply the setting is in the US.  \n\nThe external check provides slightly less confidence (8), primarily because there's no readily available information online confirming an artist named Hugo de Melo and a specific artwork titled \"Untitled 01\" featuring this scene.  However, the absence of such readily available information doesn't automatically invalidate the caption. Many artists, especially those not widely known, might not have an extensive online presence.  The key aspects—Coney Island's existence, the plausibility of an artist creating a work in this location, and a title like 'Untitled 01'—remain consistent and valid.  There is no direct contradiction between the image content and the caption. \n\nThe discrepancy in confidence scores between the internal and external checks is manageable. The internal check relies on direct visual evidence and common artistic practices; the external check relies on indirect evidence (the existence of an artist and artwork). Both checks agree on the fundamental aspects of the caption: the location and the plausibility of the title. The stronger confidence score of the internal check is justified by its reliance on direct visual observation. The overall confidence level is therefore set at 9, reflecting the combined assessments and acknowledging the lack of readily available external verification for the artist and specific artwork.  There are no significant conflicts or discrepancies to resolve, only a minor difference in confidence level stemming from the difficulty of externally verifying the artist's work, rather than any inconsistency with the image itself.",
        "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy. The internal check is highly confident due to strong visual alignment.  The external check shows slightly lower confidence due to the lack of readily available online information about the artist and specific artwork, but this is not contradictory to the image and caption details. Overall, the caption is deemed accurate."

            "content": "Claim:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump leaked classified information about a U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia after receiving his first national security intelligence briefing.\nIt's standard operating procedure during a U.S. presidential election year for the duly nominated candidate of each party to receive one or more national security briefings after the close of the Republican and Democratic conventions. On 29 July 2016, the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Philadelphia, the mainstream media reported that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would receive their first such briefings as early as the following week.\nThe briefings aren't as detailed as those a sitting president gets, the Washington Post reported, nor is the information shared in them deeply sensitive, nor, in fact, are the briefings even required, according to historian Michael Beschloss. They began under the Truman administration in 1952 and are provided strictly as a courtesy to the candidates.\nOne respect in which the 2016 campaign differs from others in recent memory is the fact that there have been calls from some in both political parties to deny the other's candidate access to secret intelligence on the grounds that they can't be trusted  Clinton because classified information was found on her private e-mail server and Trump because he publicly called for President Vladimir Putin of Russia  albeit jokingly, Trump later said  to spy on Clinton's e-mail traffic.\nAs if made to order, a flap erupted on 29 July when Trump gave a speech in Colorado Springs in which he reiterated a familiar complaint about NATO member nations not contributing their fair share to pay defense costs, this time expressing displeasure that \"We pay rent for our base in Saudi Arabia.\"\nAs noted by The Guardian and others in reporting on the speech, the U.S. closed its main military base in Saudi Arabia in 2003. (Also, Saudi Arabia is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.)\nTalk of Trump revealing classified information at that moment appears to have originated via Twitter with this exchange initiated by journalist Ben Jacobs:\nA short time later, Jameson Parker posted an article on IfYouOnlyNews.com entitled \"Trump May Have Leaked Classified Info on His First Day Getting Intelligence Briefings.\" Parker wrote:\nIf America does still have a base in Saudi Arabia it was a site not meant to be made public. The consequences of having that exposed could quite have massive consequences for Americas role in the Middle East.\nThere are two possibilities here: Either Donald Trump is so woefully out of touch with American foreign policy that he thinks a base that closed down 13 years ago is still open  or he just leaked a staggering nugget of classified information. Should it come to light that there is indeed a secret base in Saudi Arabia, you can forget about homebrew servers  Trump just committed a massive crime.\nReverb Press followed suit, making essentially the same case. That article was tweeted, retweeted, and ultimately reposted on Daily Kos, Democratic Underground and other left-leaning sites, none of which appeared too concerned (at least initially) that what they were repeating was purely speculative; it was also false.\nConsider this: Nowhere has it been reported that Donald Trump actually had an intelligence briefing before he gave the speech in Colorado Springs. In fact, he gave that speech on the same day the Washington Post reported that candidate briefings could take place \"perhaps as early as next week.\"\nMoreover, Trump's complaint about Saudi Arabia and NATO countries not paying their share of defense costs is a familiar refrain  he mentions it in virtually every speech he makes about foreign policy issues. In point of fact, erroneously on his part or not, Trump has raised the specific issue of the U.S. having to pay rent on bases in Saudi Arabia before. He did it most recently in an interview with the New York Times on 25 March 2016  months before he was nominated and became eligible to receive intelligence briefings:\nFrom China to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance, protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend, when they're sitting with trillions of dollars, I mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, now they're still making a fortune, you know, their oil is very high and very easy to get it, very inexpensive, but they're still making a lot of money, but they were making a billion dollars a day and we were paying leases for bases? We're paying leases, we're paying rent? OK? To have bases over there? The whole thing is preposterous.\nThere is no evidence that Donald Trump received a national security intelligence briefing before his 29 July 2016 speech in Colorado Springs, nor did he say anything he hasn't said before about U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia.",

However, we've found no evidence to support the claim that it was taken at a beauty contest.\nThe earliest internet postings of the photo we could find came in articles concerning the early days of swimsuit fashion. In 2012, Angus Trumble, the Director of the National Portrait Gallery of Australia in Canberra, provided a little more information about the photograph's origins.\nIn a brief anecdote, Trumble wrote that the photo was originally available as a postcard captioned \"Schner durch Streifen. Mitteleuropa um 1910,\" which translates roughly to \"men made more beautiful by stripes.

The first phrase is difficult to translate with equal concision, but surely means [men made more] beautiful by stripes, and presumably therefore drips with irony.\nWhile we've yet to see the back of this postcard, Trumble's account is supported by the fact that this same image is available via Winkler Postkarten, a German website that sells old postcards, under the same German caption: \"Schner durch Streifen Mitteleuropa um 1910.\"\nThe claim that this photo shows a \"men's beauty contest in 1919\" doesn't appear to be based on any evidence.

However, the external check provides strong evidence contradicting this assessment.  The external check, with a confidence score of 10, indicates that the claim of the image depicting a 1919 men's beauty contest is unsubstantiated.  It highlights the lack of evidence supporting this claim and traces the origin of the caption to attempts to increase the image's shareability on social media. The discrepancy arises because the internal check focuses solely on the visual content of the photograph, aligning it with a general notion of a men's beauty contest based on the attire and the group setting.  It does not account for the historical context and provenance of the image. The external check, on the other hand, leverages additional evidence beyond the image itself, investigating the online circulation of the image and the claims associated with it.  This investigation reveals that the 1919 men's beauty contest caption is a fabricated addition, not based on verifiable historical records.  This external validation carries more weight due to its investigation of the image's history and online distribution.  The high confidence score of the external check outweighs the lower score of the internal check, leading to a conclusion that the caption is out of context. Entity analysis supports the external check;  the entities mentioned in the image (men in swimwear) are not uniquely associated with a 1919 men's beauty contest, even if visually consistent with a general interpretation. The lack of supporting historical evidence for the contest further reinforces this.  Therefore, although the image shows a group of men in swimwear from the early 20th century, the claim of it being a 1919 beauty contest is unfounded and thus, the caption is judged to be out of context.  The confidence score is 9 because while the internal check aligns with a plausible (though unproven) interpretation of the image, the strong external evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is misleading.",

Barr also said in a statement that \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\nBut the United States currently does not have a process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations, which makes Trump's ability to enforce such a designation highly unlikely.\nAntifa, short for anti-fascist, is an amorphous movement of people who are opposed to fascism. They do not comprise an organized group, do not have a visible leadership, and acknowledge that they are secretive, so it is impossible to know how many people even count themselves as members. Anti-fascists lean strongly toward the left of the political spectrum, and many of them refer to themselves as socialists, anarchists, communists, or anti-capitalists. The positions of various antifa groups can also be difficult to define, but many of them support oppressed community members and protest against amassing of wealth by corporations.\nSome antifa movements date their origins to the battle against European fascism in the 1920s and '30s. The BBC cited Mark Bray, the author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" as an authority in noting that \"[Bray] says the modern American Antifa movement began in the 1980s with a group called Anti-Racist Action. Its members confronted neo-Nazi skinheads at punk gigs in the American Midwest and elsewhere. By the early 2000s the Antifa movement was mostly dormant -- until the rise of Donald Trump and the alt-right.\"\nAntifa groups are not monolithic and employ a range of tactics. Many condemn the use of violence, but according to BBC News, some groups engage in aggressive confrontations, especially with far-right groups on the streets. Extreme factions have carried pepper spray, bricks, knives, and chains with them.\nTrump claimed members of the movement were responsible for acts of vandalism during the May and June 2020 protests against police brutality in the U.S., but in at least one case a white supremacist group was found to have posed as antifa on Twitter. Groups associated with both right and left, not just antifa, are being accused of inciting violence and looting during the protests. In most cases it is difficult to ascertain that antifa is solely responsible for the lawless activities occurring at some protests, and the culprits are still being investigated, as Keith Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, observed on NBC's \"Meet the Press\":\n\"The truth is, nobody really knows ...Theres been a lot of videotape taken by demonstrators of people who are very suspicious, who really did start breaking windows ... There have been other photographs of cars with no license plates. Very suspicious behavior.\nIt would all have to be investigated, he said.\nWithout any official structure to the group, or much evidence linking antifa to specific acts of violence, it would be difficult to prove that that body of activists is behind anything, Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security program, said: \"As far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure ... Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\"\nTrump's ability to designate anti-fascists as a terrorist group is also highly suspect given that only foreign groups can be labeled as \"terrorist\" organizations under U.S. law, and \"domestic terrorism\" is not currently a federal crime in the U.S., according to the New York Times:\nA federal law defines terrorism as crimes of violence that are intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government policy. But it distinguishes between international terrorism, which must have a foreign or transnational nexus, and domestic terrorism, which occurs primarily on American soil.\nActs of terrorism transcending national boundaries is a federal crime, giving the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors jurisdiction to take the lead. There is no equivalent crime of domestic terrorism, so law enforcement officials deal with such offenses using other laws that do not have terrorism in their labels, such as the state-level crime of murder.\nA 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) on domestic terrorism similarly stated that:\nThe federal government does not generate an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations or individuals. The development of such a list may be precluded by civil liberties concerns (i.e., inclusion in a publicly available list may impinge on a groups exercise of free speech or its other constitutionally protected activities). However, a lack of official lists or processes to designate groups or individuals as domestic terrorists makes it difficult to assess domestic terrorism trends and evaluate federal efforts to counter such threats. In 2011, an unnamed [Department of Homeland Security] official cited in a news report stated that unlike international terrorism, there are no designated domestic terrorist groups. Subsequently, all the legal actions of an identified extremist group leading up to an act of violence are constitutionally protected and not reported on by DHS.\nThe CRS report also noted that although the U.S. does not officially designate domestic terror organizations, it does record individual terrorists and threats in its Terrorist Screening Database:\nWhile the government does not provide an official and public list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does include domestic terrorists (along with international terrorists) in its Terrorist Screening Database, commonly known as the Terrorist Watchlist ...\nWhile not naming specific groups, DOJ and the FBI have openly delineated domestic terrorist threats. DOJ has identified domestic terrorism threats to include criminal activity by animal rights extremists, ecoterrorists, anarchists, antigovernment extremists such as sovereign citizens and unauthorized militias, black separatists, white supremacists, and abortion extremists.\nIn an interview with Snopes, Patel said that a number of different crimes can be designated as acts of terrorism:\nThere is no single crime of either domestic or international terrorism. But both types of terrorism can be prosecuted under a number of statutes which constitute crimes of terrorism. The crime of hijacking an airplane, for example, is an act of terrorism. In fact, the government has available 51 different criminal statutes which can be applied domestic terrorism. It does not  and should not  have the ability to designate a domestic organization. This would allow the government to target political activity as terrorism, which is exactly what the White House and the Justice Department are trying to do by threatening to go after protestors under the guise of targeting Antifa.\nThe State Department makes a list of designated \"Foreign Terrorist Organizations\" (FTO) available on their website. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), enforcing the terrorist designation for FTOs involves blocking assets, prosecuting individuals, and imposing immigration restrictions on FTOs, their members, and their supporters.\nPatel added that the Secretary of State can designate foreign terrorist groups, but this triggers a range of consequences: \"most important of which is the ability to prosecute anyone who provides the group with material support, no matter how minimal. In addition property and assets of persons linked to terrorism can be blocked, but only under a law that requires a connection to a mainly foreign threat.\"\nThus, as a large, decentralized entity with no infrastructure or assets that we know of, designating and targeting antifa as a domestic terrorist organization could, according to some experts, create a dangerous scenario, as Patel told us:\nIf persons who identified as 'Antifa' suspected of committing crimes that violate any of the federal crimes of terrorism or other criminal they could of course be properly investigated and prosecuted. The FBI has more than ample authority to investigate individuals they suspect of being engaged in criminal activity. The problem is the FBI's rules are so loose they can also investigate people who are not suspected of criminal activity, so these powers are easily abused. The FBI has a long history of investigating environmentalists and anti-war activists and recently fabricated a new terrorist threat of black identity extremists and it would be altogether surprising if they didnt spy on the protestors.\nThe paucity of evidence directly connecting antifa to acts violence during protests, combined with the structureless nature of the group and the fact that the U.S. currently has no legal process for designating domestic terrorist organizations, leads us to rate this claim as \"False.\"",

According to some reports, officers have given no explanation for the arrests.\nWhy? One Instagram post has a theory.\n\"Here is what is going on since Trump labeled ANTIFA a terrorist organization their rights were stripped by the Patriot Act which states if someone is labeled a terrorist they are not afforded due process,\" reads the July 18 post. \"PS: Obama suspended habeas corpus too!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)\nThe Instagram post is a screenshot of a Facebook post from a comedian named Sam Tripoli. We reached out to him for a comment, but we havent heard back.\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nAntifa stands for \"anti-fascist.\" Its a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists thats been around for decades, but has had a resurgence since the election of President Donald Trump.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly blamed antifa activists for the violent protests that erupted after the death of George Floyd in late May. Theres no evidence that antifa played any significant role, but Trump said May 31 that the United States would designate the movement as a terrorist organization.\nThe post is inaccurate. Antifa is not a designated terrorist organization, and even if it were, American activists would still have due process rights.\nAntifa isnt a terrorist organization\nDespite Trumps tweet, antifa has not been designated as a terrorist organization. It is not listed on the State Departments list of foreign terrorist organizations.\nNational security experts told PolitiFact there is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. If the Trump administration did try to designate antifa as a terrorist organization, it would likely be challenged in court.\nAlso, antifa is not a structured organization  it has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups.\n\"Its a little bit like feminism,\" Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact. \"There are feminist groups just like there are antifa groups, but neither feminism nor antifa is a group.\"\nSecond: If antifa groups were designated terrorists, American activists would still have due process rights thanks to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nThe Patriot Act, which passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, does not give federal officers the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause. The legislation mainly expanded law enforcements ability to use wiretaps in counter-terrorism investigations. It was re-authorized and revised in 2015 to place limits on how much telecommunication data intelligence agencies can collect from Americans.\nWhats going on in Portland?\nIf antifa isnt a terrorist organization, then why are law enforcement officials detaining protesters in Portland? It has to do with the federal governments response to ongoing protests over police brutality.\nDemonstrators in Portland have been protesting against police brutality and racism against Black Americans since the death of George Floyd in late May. On July 14, reports surfaced that federal law enforcement agents were using unmarked cars to detain protesters in Portland. Over the next few days, videos shared on social media showed the detentions.\nFederal agents in Portland include members of the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and a unit from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. Border Patrol told CNBC that agents were deployed to Portland in support of a June 26 executive order from Trump and a new Homeland Security task force for protecting American communities.\nThe Trump administration says the officers are needed to restore peace in Portland, where protests devolved into rioting July 18. But Oregon officials and Democrats have criticized the federal governments crackdown.\nThe Oregon attorney general filed a lawsuit July 17 that alleges the federal government violated citizens rights by detaining them without probable cause. On July 19, House Democrats called for an investigation into allegations that federal officials were unlawfully arresting protesters. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley  all Democrats  have criticized the Trump administrations use of force against protesters.\nIts unclear to what extent antifa activists are among the protesters detained in Portland. The city is home to the oldest antifa cell in the country, and activists associated with the movement have been involved in recent protests there. One purported antifa activist faces charges for alleged crimes that took place during the demonstrations.\nOur ruling\nThe Instagram post claims that, since antifa is a terrorist organization, its members due process rights are stripped by the Patriot Act.\nThats wrong.\nAntifa is not an organized group and has not been designated as a terrorist organization. Even if it were, American antifa activists would still have due process rights afforded to them by the Constitution. The Patriot Act does not give federal law enforcement officials the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause.\nThe Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",

Appearing on Fox News, he described the rioters as \"Antifa-like\", but stressed it \"remains to be seen exactly how\" the peaceful protests took a sinister turn.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he had evidence that people from outside Minneapolis were involved in acts of violence in the state. He did not explain if these people were aligned with any groups or political beliefs in particular.\nOthers, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have pointed the finger at outsiders on the right wing of politics.\n\"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organised crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilise our city and our region,\" Frey tweeted on Saturday.\nHowever on Sunday, authorities in Minnesota said people from out of the state represented about 20% of Saturday's arrests.\nWhat is Antifa?\nAntifa - short for anti-fascist action - is a protest movement that strongly opposes neo-Nazis, fascism, white supremacists and racism. It is considered to be a loosely organised group of activists with no leaders.",

            "content": "As some nationwide protests have turned violent, President Donald Trump pointed to the anti-fascist movement antifa, claiming: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. But there is no such official federal designation for domestic terrorism organizations.\nExperts cited other reasons a designation  even if it were made possible  would be difficult or questionable. Antifa isnt one organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left militant anti-fascism groups.\nJames J.F. Forest, professor in the University of Massachusetts Lowells School of Criminology and Justice Studies, told us in an email. So, imagine the difficulty a prosecutor would face in a court of law proving beyond a reasonable doubt an individual was a member of ANTIFA.\nAs far as we know, antifa doesnt have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure, Faiza Patel, director of the liberty & national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told us in an interview. Also there havent been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations  a designation the U.S. government does make  is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\nProtests against police brutality and racial injustice have erupted in cities across the country following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, after a Minneapolis police officer, who is white, kneeled on his neck for several minutes, as shown in a video of the arrest.\nSome of those protests have turned violent, with businesses looted and fires set. Trump, and others in the administration, have blamed antifa and the Radical Left, as Trump put it, though state and federal officials have pointed to various groups or outsiders generally. The violence and vandalism is being led by antifa and other radical left-wing groups, the president said on May 30.\nThe next day, Trump made his statement about designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\nNo Domestic Terrorist Designation\nTheres no legal process or meaning for what the president said, Patel told us. Hes reflecting on the process that we use for foreign terrorist organizations.\nThe secretary of state has the legal authority to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations under federal law. The federal government makes those FTO designations through a six-step process involving the State Department and other agencies. The designations enable the federal government to freeze assets, prosecute individuals for aiding those groups and restrict immigration for members of those groups, as the Government Accountability Office explains.\n[W]e have federal criminal statutes regarding Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, but no equivalent for domestic terrorism, Forest told us. As an example, Timothy McVeigh was prosecuted in federal court for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing under a federal law addressing weapons of mass destruction because the ideology that motivated his attack was not connected to any foreign entity.\nIf there were a domestic terrorist designation, Patel said, it would undoubtedly face a First Amendment challenge, which is likely to succeed.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service also explained in a 2017 report that the federal government lacks a process for publicly designating domestic terrorist organizations. In other words, there is no official open-source roster of domestic groups that the FBI or other federal agencies target as terrorist organizations.\nIt, too, cited concerns about infringing on First Amendment freedoms if a domestic terrorist designation were possible. Such a list might discourage speech and expression related to the ideologies underpinning the activities of named groups, the CRS report said.\nMary McCord, legal director at Georgetown University Law Centers Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former Department of Justice official, and Hina Shamsi, the American Civil Liberties Unions national security project director, made similar statements to the press. No current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns, McCord said.\nWe asked the White House about the presidents tweet but we havent received a response.\nOn the same day as Trumps statement, Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement: The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\nBarrs language isnt an official designation but could indicate the resources the Department of Justice and FBI are going to put into investigating a particular threat, Patel said. She noted that the FBI has long history of targeting protest groups and said she would be very worried that by targeting antifa, an amorphous term, the Justice Department would actually be infiltrating and targeting legitimate protest activity.\nThe CRS report said that while theres no domestic terrorist designation, the DOJ and FBI have publicly named and discussed domestic terrorism threatssuch as animal rights extremism or anarchist extremismwithout illuminating exactly how they arrive at these categories.\nForest said the court cases against those individuals relied on laws against sabotage, vandalism, harassment, et al  but not domestic terrorism. The language about such threats can also indicate what resources and priority groups would receive from the DOJ. Technically, the FBI cant really gain any law enforcement tools it didnt already have simply by calling something a terrorist threat, Forest said.\nPatel said the FBI calling a group a threat was mostly language but could also reflect what resources theyre going to devote to an issue. When we call something terrorism, she said, were suggesting its something very serious.\nAlso, Forest said there are sentencing enhancements for terrorism-related acts that could bring added prison time to a conviction.\nSome experts have argued Congress should enact a law to make domestic terrorism a federal offense.\nMcCord and Jason M. Blazakis, director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, wrote in the Lawfare blog on Feb. 27, 2019 that designation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies. But making it a crime to materially support domestic terrorism  just as its a federal crime to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization  does not raise the same concerns.\nPatel, however, has argued the opposite. After House lawmakers, spurred into action by deadly white nationalists attacks, introduced legislation to make domestic terrorism a federal crime, she wrote, in October 2019, that such a law was both unnecessary and creates serious risks of abuse.\nThe FBI already has all the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of white nationalist violence, Patel said.\nUnclear What Groups Have Incited Violence\nTrump, Barr and National Security Adviser Robert OBrien have pointed to antifa as driving or leading the violent acts that have erupted in some protests. We asked the White House if it could point to evidence of that, but we havent received a response. Various government officials have blamed different groups, or said they didnt know who was behind it.\nIn a May 30 tweet, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the city was now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.\nMark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, wrote in the Washington Post that he suspects some members of antifa groups have been involved in the protests but there arent enough of them to lead nationwide destruction tactics.\n[A]ntifa itself is not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity, Bray said.\nBased on my research into antifa groups, I believe its true that most, if not all, members do wholeheartedly support militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it this week. Im also confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance during this dramatic rebellion, he wrote. Yet it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups because members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right, and concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small. Basically, there are nowhere near enough anarchists and members of antifa groups to have accomplished such breathtaking destruction on their own.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked about Barrs statement that it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left-extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, said the truth is nobody really knows. He said on NBCs Meet the Press on May 31 that there had been very suspicious behavior, including cars with no license plates.\nIve talked to people who are demonstrating, some of them say they think some of those folks are from Minnesota. And they also say some people have come from out of town. What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it, Ellison said.\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said those cities were investigating who was responsible for the violence. Were working to get to the bottom of that right now, Carter said on CBS Face the Nation.\nIt looked differently racially in our city than our normal protests looked, Bottoms said on the same show. And it was  it was just it was a different group. So we dont know who they were, but many of them were not locally based.",

Internal validation confirms the image depicts a vigil with lit candles in front of a church in Nice, France, consistent with a public mourning event following a tragedy. The masked individuals and solemn atmosphere reinforce this interpretation. While the caption specifies the Notre Dame Basilica, the image doesn't explicitly name it, although the architectural style is suggestive. However, external validation strongly supports the caption's claim. News reports extensively covered the October 2020 knife attack at the Notre Dame Basilica in Nice, resulting in fatalities and prompting President Macron's public condemnation as an \"Islamist terrorist attack.\"  The external evidence confirms the location, the nature of the event (a terrorist attack resulting in deaths), and the public reaction. Although the caption mentions Macron's statement and the term \"Islamist terrorist attack,\" which are not visually evident in the image, these details are contextually relevant and corroborated by reliable news sources.  The high confidence scores from both internal (10) and external (8) validation strongly support the caption's accuracy. The slight difference in confidence scores stems from the image's inability to explicitly state the church's name and mention Macron's statement. However, contextual clues from the location, the vigil atmosphere, and the corroborating news reports outweigh this limitation.  Therefore, the overall assessment is that the caption is not out of context and has a high degree of accuracy. The image shows a direct result of the event mentioned in the caption, namely a public display of mourning and remembrance.",

However, the external check significantly lowers the confidence score to 4 because the claim about Mexicans using the wall as a tourist attraction and engaging in a speed climbing competition lacks reliable sources and is considered speculative.  The caption presents this claim as a humorous anecdote rather than a verifiable fact. The discrepancy arises from the nature of the claim—while the general context of people climbing the border wall is visually depicted in the image, the specific details in the caption (Mexican tourist attraction, speed climbing competition, and the 45-second record) are unsupported by evidence.  Therefore, the validation leans towards the external check's lower confidence score due to the lack of external verification for the key claims made in the caption.  The internal validation is based on the visual resemblance to the border wall and the action of people climbing it, which are shown in the picture; however, the caption adds claims that cannot be confirmed.  The entity alignment is only partially successful.  The image supports the general theme of people climbing the border wall, but it fails to validate the specific details regarding the Mexican tourist attraction and the speed-climbing competition with time records.  To improve the caption, additional verification of the claims about the Mexican tourist attraction and speed climbing competition is required.  The most crucial aspect is to verify this specific claim with credible news reports, official statements, or other authoritative sources.  If such evidence is lacking, the caption should be revised to remove or rephrase the unverifiable statements to avoid misrepresentation.  The original caption relies on anecdotal evidence, which may not be reliable enough to sustain its claims regarding the speed-climbing competition.  The absence of external evidence supporting the anecdote weakens the overall trustworthiness of the caption.",

Bellantoni, they asserted, told the tale of a hapless (but non-existent) man named Will Bottom, who claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff, his \"gay lover.\" To illustrate this supposedly abusive relationship, the article repurposed an image of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn, New York, man who suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked and beaten in 2013.\nThe real Christina Bellantoni never spoke to anyone from TheNetSpies and took to Twitter to make it clear the story was falsified:\nThis isn't the only unfounded rumor to dog Schiff, who became chair of the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",

The conflict between the internal and external checks lies in the interpretation of the caption's claim. While the image internally aligns with the subject, Rep.

The internal validation process successfully identifies Yasmine Azaiez, the instrument (violin), and the event (Hammamet International Festival) depicted in the image.  All entities are correctly identified and contextualized. This suggests a strong match between the image and the provided caption information.\n\nThe external check, while also supportive (score: 8), introduces a degree of uncertainty due to the absence of readily available corroborating evidence pinpointing Yasmine Azaiez's performance at the Hammamet International Festival on August 5th, 2020. While the existence of both the artist and the festival is verified, confirming the exact date and event remains challenging without access to a specific event program or media coverage for that particular date.  The external validation highlights a common limitation: confirming a precise date for a performance within a large-scale festival relies on specific event records which may not be publicly accessible.\n\nThe discrepancy between the internal and external confidence scores stems from the different validation approaches. The internal validation focuses on direct image-caption alignment, while external validation involves corroborating information from external sources. The higher internal confidence reflects the image's clear depiction of the subject and event details. The slightly lower external confidence reflects a lack of immediate access to definitive proof of the specific date and event. \n\nHowever, the external check doesn't contradict the internal findings.  It only adds a layer of uncertainty concerning a specific detail (the precise date).  There is no information suggesting the caption is completely inaccurate or misleading; the absence of direct confirmation does not negate the considerable evidence from the internal analysis, particularly the positive identification of the musician and festival.\n\nConsidering the high internal confidence and the supportive, though slightly less certain, external validation, the final assessment concludes that the caption is highly likely to be accurate, with a confidence score adjusted to 9 reflecting the slight uncertainty about the precise performance date.  The available information makes it overwhelmingly probable that Yasmine Azaiez performed at the Hammamet International Festival, even if the exact date of that performance remains unconfirmed from readily available external sources.",

        "explanation": "The caption's claim that the SUV is carrying Michael Cohen upon arrival at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, NY on Monday is evaluated through internal and external checks.  The internal check analyzes the image itself.  The image shows a black SUV at the entrance of the named institution, which aligns with the caption's description of the vehicle and location. However, the image lacks any visual confirmation of Michael Cohen's presence inside the vehicle. The internal check's high confidence score (10) stems from the clear alignment between the image and the caption's description of the vehicle and location, despite the inability to verify Cohen's presence.  The external check assesses the claim's consistency with known facts. Public records confirm Michael Cohen's incarceration and the existence of the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville. News reports widely covered his legal proceedings and imprisonment. However, precisely pinpointing his arrival date at Otisville requires access to detailed official records or very specific news reports, which is beyond the scope of this analysis. The external check's confidence score (8) reflects the plausibility of the claim given the publicly available information, even without absolute certainty about the specific arrival date.  The conflict between the two checks arises from the internal check's inability to visually confirm Cohen's presence in the SUV, while the external check supports the plausibility of the claim based on widely known facts about Cohen's imprisonment.  To reconcile this, we rely on the overall weight of evidence. The strong alignment of the image with the location and vehicle type, combined with the high plausibility of Cohen's arrival at the institution (as supported by external sources), points towards a high probability that the caption is accurate, despite the lack of direct visual confirmation of Cohen.  Therefore, given the strong evidence for location and the plausible timeline supported by external sources, the conclusion is that the caption is not out of context. The overall confidence score is slightly reduced to reflect the uncertainty about Cohen's presence within the SUV. There is high confidence in the image representing the stated location, but the confidence in the claim about Cohen being inside the car is lower due to the absence of direct visual confirmation, hence the final confidence score of 9.",

It was set up by demonstrators amid protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose in-custody death while pinned under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020 went viral after being captured on video.\nDuring the resulting weeks of sustained protests against racism and police brutality, Seattle activists set up the police-free zone, which has become a target for criticism by President Donald Trump and his supporters. But disparaging comments linking the performer to the CHOP are misleading, as the image has nothing to do with the protests.\nHere is the version of the photograph that is being shared, along with commentary such as, \"Antifa Seattle today  this is the group that the Democrats want to rule America  no further comment necessary?!\"\nBut the picture wasn't taken in Seattle, and it wasn't taken during the protests that swept the nation in the spring of 2020 in the wake of Floyd's killing.\nThe original photograph was taken by photographer Peretz Partensky on Sept. 25, 2011, at the Folsom Street Fair, which is a leather and BDSM festival that takes place every fall in San Francisco, California. And the singer in the black netting is a member of the Italian disco band Hard Ton, which is based in Venice, Italy, according to its Facebook profile. The antifa flag in the upper left corner was edited into the picture after the fact.\nWe contacted Hard Ton for comment about the picture being misappropriated, but did not hear back in time for publication.\nBecause the original photograph was taken long before the CHOP was set up in Seattle, and the events took place in a different location altogether, we rate this claim \"Miscaptioned.\"",

However, the external check (score 3) reveals a critical discrepancy.  It finds no record of a Cleveland Volcano eruption in 2006, despite acknowledging the volcano's existence and the ISS's history of photographing such events. This conflict necessitates a closer examination.\n\nEntity Alignment: The internal check correctly aligns entities—volcanic eruption, Cleveland Volcano, Alaska, and ISS. The external check confirms the existence of the volcano and the ISS's capabilities but challenges the specific date of the eruption.\n\nInternal Validation: The internal check's strong confidence stems from the visual plausibility of the image. The eruption, location, and perspective align with the caption's description. However, this relies heavily on visual interpretation and lacks corroboration from reliable data sources.\n\nExternal Validation: The external check's low confidence is justified by the absence of verifiable evidence for a 2006 eruption. While acknowledging the possibility of a past eruption, it highlights the need to confirm this specific event through volcanological records and NASA archives. This check employs a more rigorous approach by demanding verifiable data.\n\nDiscrepancies: The core discrepancy lies in the date of the eruption. The internal check focuses on visual interpretation, while the external check demands verifiable factual data.  This creates a conflict where one method strongly asserts the claim, while the other cannot verify it.\n\nEvidence Weighing: The external check's reliance on documented evidence is crucial. Visual plausibility alone is insufficient to substantiate a claim about a specific event. Thus, the lack of external confirmation significantly outweighs the internal check's confidence based on visual interpretation.\n\nUncertainty: The uncertainty comes from the lack of readily available corroborative evidence for a 2006 Cleveland Volcano eruption.  Additional research in volcanological databases and NASA's image archives is necessary before a definitive conclusion is reached.\n\nConflict Analysis: The conflict underscores the need for corroboration.  While the image might depict a Cleveland Volcano eruption, the absence of evidence for a 2006 eruption renders the claim about the specific year highly questionable. The high internal confidence score is deceptive due to the lack of external validation.\n\nEntity Analysis: Entity analysis strengthens the external check.  Although the entities ('volcanic eruption,' 'Cleveland volcano,' 'Alaska,' 'International Space Station') are all real and plausibly related, the crucial temporal entity ('2006') lacks external support, making the caption potentially out of context.\n\nConclusion: Based on the evidence, the caption is deemed out of context (OOC = True). The confidence score is lowered to 4, reflecting the uncertainty about the year of the eruption despite the visual plausibility of the image itself.  Further investigation into documented eruption records is vital to resolve the conflict.",
        "validation_summary": "Internal check strongly supports the caption based on visual analysis, while the external check cannot verify the specified eruption date (2006), leading to a conflict. The lack of corroborating evidence for the 2006 eruption lowers overall confidence."

A crucial point of divergence is that while the internal check is highly confident about the pilot and aircraft details, it cannot verify the carrier. In contrast, the external check supports the plausibility of the entire caption context but with less confidence due to the absence of direct visual confirmation. This highlights the limitations of image-based analysis when relying on implicit contextual information. To increase confidence, additional information would be needed to confirm the exact location and time of the photo.  While the internal check is primarily focused on immediate image content and shows strong alignment with the aspects that can be visually confirmed, the external check broadens the analysis to include plausible real-world scenarios and contextual information. The combined analysis demonstrates the complementarity of these two verification approaches. The final confidence score reflects a balance between the high confidence in the easily verifiable parts of the caption (pilot, aircraft type) and the lower confidence in the less visually confirmed part (the presence of HMS Queen Elizabeth). Even though the image content strongly supports the key elements, the lack of clear confirmation of the aircraft carrier's presence results in a judgment of 'Out Of Context' and the moderate confidence score of 8, reflecting the uncertainty around that part of the caption.",
        "validation_summary": "Internal check shows strong confidence in the pilot and aircraft identification but lacks visual confirmation of the aircraft carrier. External check supports the plausibility but reduces confidence due to the lack of definitive proof of location. Overall, the caption is deemed 'Out Of Context' due to lack of visual evidence for the carrier, despite strong alignment with other aspects."

The caption, however, describes the FBI's concerns following the firing of James Comey, which is not visually depicted.  The image provides context related to Trump, but it doesn't visually represent the core message of the caption regarding the FBI's concerns and the potential for \"anti-American activity.\" The internal check highlights this mismatch, assigning a confidence score of 10 due to the clear disconnect between visual content and the narrative's main focus.  The external check acknowledges the historical accuracy of the caption's core claim: Trump did fire Comey, and concerns were indeed raised within the FBI regarding the implications of this action.  However, the external validation also points out the subjectivity of the phrase \"anti-American activity.\"  While concerns were raised, it's not definitively verifiable from readily available sources that the FBI explicitly concluded that Trump's actions constituted anti-American activity.  Therefore, the external check assigns a lower confidence score of 8 due to this nuanced point.  The conflict between the high internal confidence (lack of visual alignment) and the relatively high external confidence (historical plausibility) necessitates a careful assessment. The primary discrepancy lies in the image not illustrating the central point of the caption, making the caption out of context with respect to the image's content.  The external validation supports the historical background of the caption, but the image itself cannot verify the caption's implied claims regarding the FBI's precise conclusions and characterization of Trump's actions.  The overall assessment prioritizes the visual mismatch highlighted by the internal check. While the caption describes real events, the image fails to represent those key events, which is the decisive factor determining the OOC judgment. The confidence score is 8 because the external validation validates the historical event described; however, it is lowered since the image is out of context of the caption's core narrative.",

While both checks agree that the caption isn't demonstrably *false* given the lack of visual evidence to the contrary, the assertion of closure is unsupported by the image. The combination of a high internal confidence score (based on correctly identifying the location) and a lower external confidence score (acknowledging the lack of information regarding operational status) leads to a moderate overall confidence score of 8. There's a discrepancy between the internal assessment that the caption is accurate (lacking information regarding the closure claim, but not contradicting it) and the external assessment which notes the lack of definitive proof. However, this discrepancy is resolved by focusing on what the evidence actually shows (the building's identification) and what it doesn't (the operational status).

            "content": "Claim:\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla refused to take the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\nIn March and April 2021, widely shared social media posts falsely claimed that Albert Bourla, the Greek CEO of the pharmaceutical multinational company Pfizer, had refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine produced by his own company, in collaboration with the German company BioNTech. Anti-vaccine commentators and COVID-19 conspiracy theorists seized upon this purported admission as evidence that the vaccine was, in fact, harmful.\nOn March 24, the Facebook page Tru York, which routinely posts baseless and potentially dangerous misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, published a video with the banner headline \"PFEIZER [sic] CEO REFUSES VACCINE.\" The video contained a short clip of Bourla, in a television interview, responding to a question about when he himself intended to receive the vaccine. Bourla is shown saying:\n\"The sooner I can, I will. The only sensitivity here, Meg, is that I don't want to have an example that I'm cutting the line, that I'm 59 years old, in good health, I'm not working in the front line. So my type is not recommended to get [the] vaccination now. So that's one consideration.\"\nAlongside the video, social media users also shared memes that claimed Bourla had \"refused\" to take Pfizer's own COVID-19 vaccine. The caption on the video shared by Tru York was false and misleading in two principle ways.\nFirstly, the footage itself does not show Bourla refusing to take the vaccine. Rather, he expresses enthusiasm about that prospect (\"The sooner I can, I will\"), but explains the understandable position that he hadn't yet taken it because he wanted to avoid the appearance of using his position of privilege to take the vaccine ahead of older and more medically vulnerable individuals.\nSecondly, the interview in question was recorded months earlier, and Bourla had in fact taken the vaccine by the time Tru York published the video, and other social media users posted similar memes.\nIn an interview with Axios reporter Caitlin Owens, broadcast on HBO on March 7, Bourla said he had received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine around three weeks earlier, meaning some time in February 2021. In a tweet on March 10, Bourla posted a photograph of himself receiving what he described as the second dose:\nThe Tru York video was therefore posted two weeks after Bourla went on record as having received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. By contrast, the interview footage in which Bourla explained why he had not yet received the vaccine, but was looking forward to doing so, was actually recorded three months earlier.\nThat interview was broadcast by CNBC's Squawk Box on Dec. 14, 2020, and can be viewed below. Interviewer Meg Tirrell asked Bourla \"I've heard you have not yet had your shot. When do you plan to get it?\" Bourla's response is worth including in full, because he offers a more in-depth explanation of the dilemma of when to take the vaccine than what was included in the subsequent Tru York video:\nThe sooner I can, I will. The only sensitivity here, Meg, is that I don't want to have an example that I'm cutting the line, that I'm 59 years old, in good health, I'm not working in the front line. So my type is not recommended to get [the] vaccination now. So that's one consideration. On the other hand, our company [has] run a lot of polls to see what would take people to believe it. And one of the highest-ranking [responses], even higher than if Joe Biden takes it, even higher than if other presidents take it, is if the CEO of the company takes it.\nSo with that it mind, I'm trying to find a way that I will get vaccinated, [even] if it is not my time, just to demonstrate the confidence of the company. But we have made a decision that if we have to do that, we will not do it with our executives, so none of the executives or board members would cut the line  they would take it as their age and occupation type  it's time for them to take [it].",

Although the external validation raises the question of probability, which slightly reduces the confidence score to 9, the overall alignment between the image, caption, and plausible explanations results in a positive outcome for context assessment. The fact that a train derailment is possible, that sculptures can be substantial obstacles, and that train drivers could survive such accidents with minimal injuries all contribute to the external validation's positive verdict.

The ad hinted at a fall from grace: \"Once a Hollywood Legend, Now Working a Regular Job.\"\nReaders who clicked the ad were led to a 39-page slideshow article on the website Loan Pride. Its headline read, \"Former Stars Who Now Work a Regular 9-5 Job.\"\nThe pictures from the ad did not show Cameron Diaz now working a \"regular 9-5 job.\" US Weekly reported that the photographs simply showed her \"leaving a friend's home.\"\nFurther, she does not work a 9-to-5 job at all. She appeared on page 39, the final page of the misleading story:\nRetired actress Cameron Diaz has had a fantastic career in Hollywood and has gained several awards for her performances. She has been graced with a New York Film Critics Award, four Golden Globe Award nominations, and three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. She landed her first major role when she was only 21 and appeared in the comedy film \"The Mask\" alongside Jim Carrey. She has mostly acted in comedy films such as \"The Other Woman,\" \"Bad Teacher,\" and others. Devoting her time to writing, Diaz has already published two health books titles \"The Body Book\" and \"The Longevity Book.\" The former was a New York Times bestseller.\nHer work as an author wasn't her only pursuit after leaving acting. In July 2020, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that she and her friend Katherine Power launched a \"clean wine\" company called Avaline. The Chronicle also said she \"spent the last decade building herself into a lifestyle and wellness guru.\"\nIn August 2020, Good Morning America reported that Diaz walked away from her movie career so she could find \"peace.\"\nDuring the Aug. 5 installment of \"In Goop Health: The Sessions,\" Diaz, 47, sat down with Gwyneth Paltrow, also 47, and revealed she came to the realization she needed to call it quits when she turned 40.\n\"I stopped and really looked at my life,\" she told Paltrow. \"When youre making a movie ... they own you. Youre there for 12 hours a day for months on end, you have no time for anything else.\"\n\"I realized I handed off parts of my life to all these other people,\" the 'Charlie's Angels' star added. \"I had to basically take it back and take responsibility for my own life. I had been going so hard for so long, working, making films, such a grind. I didnt make any space for my personal life.\"\nThe life-changing move has only had positive effects on Diaz, who admitted that walking away from her movie career has brought her \"peace.\"\nIn sum, Diaz is now retired from acting. Pictures in an ad did not show her working a \"regular 9-5 job.\" She also didn't have such a day job to begin with. She is an author, started a wine brand, and has a family. In December 2019, she and her husband, musician Benji Madden, welcomed a baby daughter.\nWe previously reported on a similar misleading story about former child actor Amanda Bynes.",

The Catalonia issue has reignited Spanish nationalism, largely dormant since the Franco era.\"  Both the internal and external checks agree that this caption is plausible. \n\nInternal Check:\nThe internal check gives a confidence score of 8, noting that while the image shows a demonstration with many flags, it's difficult to confirm from the image alone that it was against Catalan separatism, called by Vox, or that it happened in December.  However, the elements of the image align with the caption's description of a demonstration in Madrid with many Spanish flags, suggesting a resurgence of Spanish nationalism.  The mention of Franco is indirectly consistent with the image's implied theme of revived Spanish nationalism. The uncertainty mainly stems from the lack of explicit visual cues confirming the specific details mentioned in the caption.\n\nExternal Check:\nThe external check provides a confidence score of 8, supporting the plausibility of the caption.  Vox's opposition to Catalan separatism is well-known; holding demonstrations is a common political action; and the media often reports on the rise of Spanish nationalism linked to Catalonia.  The external check acknowledges the impossibility of verifying the precise date of a specific demonstration without access to real-time event data, but the caption's overall claim aligns with the established political context of Spain.  The lack of precise date verification is a minor limitation, but the broader statement remains consistent with public knowledge.\n\nDiscrepancies and Conflicts:\nThere are no significant discrepancies or conflicts between the internal and external checks.  Both checks acknowledge the uncertainty associated with confirming specific details (date, organizers, and precise nature of the demonstration) from the image alone, yet both concur that the caption generally aligns with the likely context.\n\nEntity Analysis:\nThe entities present in the image (flags, crowd, urban setting) support the caption's narrative of a demonstration.  The absence of clear textual evidence within the image makes definitive confirmation of specific details impossible.  However, the visual context isn't contradictory to the caption's claim.\n\nConfidence Score Justification:\nThe final confidence score of 8 reflects the combined confidence scores of 8 from both internal and external checks.  The assessments acknowledge uncertainty regarding specific details, but the general consistency between the image's context and the caption's narrative justifies a relatively high confidence score. The minor limitations of not being able to confirm precise details from the image do not undermine the overall plausibility of the caption in relation to the image presented.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the internal and external checks and the analysis of entities in the image, the caption is not out of context. While some details lack absolute confirmation from the image itself, the caption's general description and assertions align well with what is reasonably inferable from the image and known political realities in Spain.  The caption's assertion is plausible, making it highly likely to be a fair description of the depicted scenario.",

While complete verification of specific details is impossible, the overall context described aligns with the image and known political events in Spain.  No significant discrepancies were found."

            "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows a group of buses that were used to ship in paid anti-Trump protesters to Austin, Texas.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 10 November 2016, several disreputable web sites such as The Gateway Pundit published articles reporting that paid anti-Trump protesters were shipped into Austin to stage a \"fake protest\" against Donald Trump. The sole \"evidence\" for were three photographs dposted to Twitter by user Eric Tucker:\nPaid fake protesters were bussed in to the anti-Trump protests in Austin, Texas.\nThey must have spent a lot of Soros money on this operation.\nThere was a whole string of busses.\nIt figures. Everything they do is fake or paid for.\nThe Gateway Pundit did not see protesters getting on or off the bus, and they offered no proof that any protesters had been paid (by George Soros or anyone else). The web site published three pictures of buses and then fabricated a story about paid protesters based on the mistaken observations of a sole Twitter user.\nAlthough the above-displayed photographs are real, and protests did take place in Austin on 9 November 2016, these two things were not connected. According to Austin station KTBC, the buses seen here were lined up outside of the Austin Convention Center, where the Tableau Conference, which had about 11,000 attendees, was taking place:\nThe charter buses were lined up along 5th Street near Waller in Downtown, the closest point to the rally would've been Congress Avenue which is about a mile away. The protest started on the West Mall on the UT campus about 3 miles away. Down the street about 1/2 mile is Austin Convention Center. Local businesses in the area said they've seen charter buses at the location prior to the election.\nCarol Scott-Duke, works in area, We are definitely used to events happening around here with buses due to the convention center right over here and there's event centers over here, she said.\nOne of those events happening at the time of the charter bus Twitter post at the convention center is the Tableau Convention.\nKate Lyons is from Portland, Oregon and was one [of those] attending the convention.\nIt's growing every year, five years ago it started with 250 people, now it was 13,000 attendees in person. She said they have been using charter buses for the event.\nThey sold out all the hotels downtown and they ended having to send people to hotels that were outside the radius of the conference and sent buses out to ship people around for that. We saw them from day one which was Monday, she said.\nOne Twitter user also reported helping load and unload attendees for the Tableau Conference:\nOn Wednesday a few minutes after 5pm, upon leaving a meeting near downtown Austin, I chanced on a large group of busses parked just east of the I-35 on 5th Street. I snapped a few pictures and was on my way.\nLater that day, I noticed news reports of protests in downtown and near the University of Texas campus. Having dealt with closed streets and unusual traffic patterns that day toward the south of the downtown (below 8th street) and having seen some pictures of protests that looked more like the south end of downtown than near the capitol, I presumed the busses had something to do with the protests.\nCasually, I texted a few friends and then made a Twitter post. I post on Twitter just a few times a year, and until yesterday I had about 40 followers.\n[...]\nWas I flat wrong? Perhaps!\nIt turns out Tableau was having a massive conference having nothing to do with politics less than a mile away. Could these have been busses for Tableaus shenanigans? I hope they dont mind me linking to the schedule from that same day.\nA similar rumor, this time involving Chicago, was circulated after the disreputable web site Zero Hedge published a video on 13 November 2016 showing a large number of buses parked on a street. The web site provided no evidence that the buses had transported paid protesters, or that the buses had anything at all to do with the protests:\nNow, courtesy of a Zero Hedge reader, we have visual confirmation of how a substantial portion of these professional, paid protesters arrive at the site of the protest, in this case Chicago.\nAs our reader notes, \"I have a video of 5 city blocks on the West side of Chicago lined with busses from Wisconsin (Badger Bus Lines) bringing in protestors. The Sears tower is visible in the background.\"\nThe above-displayed video was taken on Canal St. just south of Roosevelt in Chicago. This street is frequently lined with buses as it is one of the closest spots to downtown that allows buses to park for free:\nBuses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus.\nImages from Google Street also show that the images captured in the Zero Hedge video are not unusual for the area. Here are screenshots from July 2016, July 2015, October 2014, and March 2009:",

Internal validation analyzes the image itself, while external validation uses outside sources to fact-check the claim.\n\nInternal validation reveals a moderate level of consistency (confidence score of 8). The image shows numerous buses parked near an apartment complex in a location that seems to be Austin, Texas. This aligns with the caption's assertion that protesters were bused in. However, the image provides no evidence concerning whether the protesters were paid or \"fake.\" The image's visual information only supports the \"bussed in\" aspect, leaving the \"paid\" and \"fake\" components unverified within the image's context.\n\nExternal validation, using Snopes, directly contradicts the caption (confidence score of 8). Snopes explicitly debunks the claim, asserting that the buses in similar images circulating online were associated with the Tableau Conference, not with anti-Trump protests. They traced the origin of the misinformation to a misinterpretation of the images on Twitter, which then spread through less credible websites. This contradicts the caption's assertion.\n\nThe conflict between internal and external validation needs careful consideration. While the image (internal) offers weak visual support for the \"bussed in\" part of the statement (and no information on the \"paid\" or \"fake\" components),  the external source (Snopes) categorically refutes the entire claim.  This discrepancy points towards the caption being highly likely out of context.\n\nThe high confidence scores (8 out of 10) for both internal and external checks, combined with the significant conflict in their findings, strongly suggest that the original caption is out of context. The Snopes fact-check provides compelling evidence that the claim is demonstrably false. The image itself, while showing buses, lacks evidence to support the \"paid\" and \"fake\" elements and only weakly suggests that people were transported by bus, which, as clarified by Snopes, was in connection with a technology conference.  The lack of evidence to support the \"paid\" and \"fake\" aspects, coupled with Snopes' direct refutation, makes the out-of-context determination highly reliable.  We acknowledge that the image shows buses, but the external source convincingly counters the caption's core assertions, leading to a final OOC judgment of True with a high confidence score of 9.",

However, external validation expresses low confidence (score 4), citing a lack of readily available evidence confirming the specific claim of a triceratops puppet at an Indonesian dinosaur theme park.  The discrepancy arises because while the image strongly suggests a dinosaur statue at what might be a theme park, it doesn't explicitly confirm the 'puppet' aspect or provide definitive location details beyond a general Indonesian setting. The external check highlights that many dinosaur theme parks exist, and the claim is not inherently impossible, but further information is needed to verify the specific details given in the caption.  The internal check relies heavily on visual interpretation, which is subjective and not necessarily conclusive proof.  The external check addresses the lack of corroborating evidence from reliable sources. To resolve the discrepancy, additional information is required, such as the source of the video, its context, and any verifiable information confirming the location and the nature of the triceratops figure as a puppet. Weighing both checks, we slightly favor the external assessment due to the need for factual verification beyond the visual interpretation. Therefore, the final judgment leans towards the caption being potentially out of context, although the confidence score is not very high (6 out of 10) due to the visual support from the image.",

He never returned, leaving the tree no choice but to grow around the bike. Incredible that this bike has been there for 98 years now!\nHowever, the bicycle is not nearly that old, nor was it left behind by a young man setting off to take part in World War I. According to the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, the bicycle was left behind in the mid-1950s by a local resident who simply abandoned it:\nTales abound explaining how a red bicycle came to be lodged in a Vashon tree a dozen feet up\nSome say it ended up there by chance, while others contend in was intentional cleverness. One former Islander, Berkeley Breathed, even wrote a children's book about the mystery.\nBut one longtime Island family had laid a solid claim to the bicycle in a tree just north of Sound Food. Two generations concur that the bicycle belonged to Don Puz, who in 1954 left his bicycle in the woods, forgot about it and never went back looking for it.\nDon received the bicycle as a donation after the family home burnt down, he said.\nThe bicycle wasn't his favorite  it had hard, solid rubber tires \"and skinny little handlebars like a tricycle,\" he said. \"I was too big a kid to ride it.\"\nAs his mother Helen Puz tells the story, Don and his friends were playing in the woods together, and Don was the only child who had ridden his bicycle there. When the boys left, Don left his bike behind, walking home with the other boys.\n\"Apparently, he wasn't too excited about that bike,\" she said.\nAfter the bike was discovered, making headlines, both mother and son paid it a visit.\n\"We went down there in the woods, and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, 'That's my bike,'\" Don recalled. \"I recognized it immediately. When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don't think I've ever seen another one like it.\"\nAlthough Don Puz identified the bicycle in the picture as his and verified that he had abandoned it in the area shown many years earlier, he said nothing about having left it chained to a tree. And given the location of the bike within the tree and the manner in which trees actually grow, it's quite unlikely the bicycle ended up in its current position through the tree's naturally enveloping it and growing around it, as many viewers assume  almost certainly one or more persons had a hand in moving the bike after Don abandoned it back in 1954.",

There is a slight discrepancy in the confidence scores (10 vs 8), but both checks agree on the overall accuracy of the caption.  Considering the strong visual evidence and the logical plausibility of the activity,  the overall confidence score is set at 9.  The minor reduction accounts for the lack of date information in the caption.  There is no significant conflict between the internal and external checks.

The internal check highlights the strong visual correlation between the image content and the caption's description. The presence of what appears to be methane bubbles in the ice, the visible frozen lake, and the mountainous backdrop consistent with the Canadian Rockies all directly support the caption's assertion. The internal check gives a high confidence score of 10, reflecting this strong visual agreement. The external check corroborates the caption's claims with a confidence score of 8. It acknowledges the established knowledge of methane bubble formation in frozen lakes, particularly the well-known occurrence of this phenomenon at Lake Abraham.  While the external check cannot definitively verify the specific origin of the ice chunk in the image (that it is definitively from Lake Abraham), the plausibility is high given the known characteristics of Lake Abraham and the general scientific understanding of methane production in such environments.  The external check provides supporting points like the natural processes leading to methane bubble formation and the common association of Lake Abraham with images showing this phenomenon. The slight difference in confidence scores between the internal (10) and external (8) checks reflects the difference between direct visual observation (internal) and indirect corroboration based on established knowledge (external). However, the overall agreement is substantial, making it highly probable that the caption accurately describes the image's content. The external check mentions a need for additional sources to fully verify that the image is indeed from Lake Abraham; however, this does not substantially diminish the plausibility that it is, given the contextual alignment.

            "content": "Claim:\nThe CDC readjusted the COVID-19 death toll from 60,000 down to 37,000.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAt the beginning of May 2020, widely circulated social media posts asserted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had substantially revised their figures for the number of deaths in the U.S. caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, from 60,000 down to about 37,000:\nThese posts fed into conspiracy theories holding that the COVID-19 pandemic was not nearly as serious as suggested by the government and the news media, and that the \"true\" mortality figures were being deceptively inflated to achieve some ulterior purpose.\nHowever, this claim was not true, and it was the result of comparing two separate data sources that report different measurements.\nThe link included in the above tweet points to the CDC's Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page, which provides provisional death totals by week and state according to the following criteria:\nThe provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; (a) by week ending date and (b) by specific jurisdictions.\nAs of May 1, 2020, that page reported the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. as being 37,308:\nHowever, that page also notes that the provisional data it displays are continually revised, may be incomplete, likely will not include more recent deaths, and may differ from other published sources because data currently are lagged by an average of 12 weeks:\nThe provisional counts for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 12 weeks.\nProvisional death counts may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Our counts often track 12 weeks behind other data for a number of reasons: Death certificates take time to be completed. There are many steps involved in completing and submitting a death certificate. Waiting for test results can create additional delays. States report at different rates. Currently, 63% of all U.S. deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, but there is significant variation among jurisdictions. It takes extra time to code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded manually, which takes an average of 7 days. Other reporting systems use different definitions or methods for counting deaths.\nThat 37,308 was not a drastic downward revision of any previously reported death total. Rather, it only might have seemed such because it was mistakenly compared to the number of deaths reported on the CDC's COVID-19 Cases in the U.S. page, which as of May 3, 2020, displayed a total of 65,735 deaths:\nWhy such a large discrepancy? Because as latter page's \"About the Data\" section explains, its data are updated daily based on \"Case notifications received by CDC from U.S. public health jurisdictions and the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)\" and includes \"both confirmed and probable deaths.\" This more up-to-date page will obviously report higher death figures that one whose data lag by 1-2 weeks.\nIndeed, two weeks earlier, the \"Cases in the U.S.\" page had displayed a total of 35,443 deaths, a number much closer to the 37,308 figure reported by the \"Provisional Death Counts\" with its 1-2 week data lag.\nIn short, this claim is like comparing stock prices from a two-week-old newspaper with those offered today by a cable news station, and then attributing any differences to a conspiracy rather than the mere passage of time as reflected in more current reporting.",

            "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows an official road sign in Arizona warning drivers about parachuting cows.\nIn March 2021, a picture was circulated on social media that supposedly showed a sign on the side of a rural road warning drivers about airborne cattle. Actor Jason Alexander was one social media user who shared this picture along with a few questions about its origins:\nIs this sign warning drivers about parachuting cows? Is that a UFO in the process of abducting an unsuspecting bovine?\nAs far as we can tell, this photograph was taken somewhere in Arizona. In 2019, the Tucson news station KVOA posted a similar picture and reported that a handful of these \"unique warning signs\" had been spotted across southern Arizona:\nWhile this appears to be a genuine photograph of a road sign in Arizona, it is not an official road sign sanctioned by the Arizona Department of Transportation. Doug Nick, the Assistant Communications Director for Public Information for ADOT, confirmed to us that this was not an ADOT-produced sign, but noted that the gravel road shown in this image may not be maintained by the state's department of transportation.\nWhile ADOT could not confirm specifics about this sign, Nick assured us that parachuting cows were not a problem in the state. Nick noted, for instance, that cows lack the opposable thumbs necessary to pull a ripcord.\nPersonally, I have lived here all of my life and have yet to see a parachuting cow or other livestock for that matter.\nI'm not a pilot, but I would imagine that the logistical challenges of herding cattle into an aircraft, strapping a parachute on them and releasing them to plummet to the earth at tremendous speed would be daunting, at least.\nThen there's the vexing problem of the ethos that \"you pack your own chute.\" That's a sensible protocol for, say, the 101st Airborne. But as cattle have no opposable thumbs, this too becomes an insurmountable challenge and also raises the question of how a heifer, bull or steer would pull the ripcord while racing headlong (horn long)? into terra firma.\nOf course, the stereotypical cartoon image of the desert often involves the presence of a cattle skull resting near a bush or a cactus. That tableau is conceivable, but we seriously doubt any of those cattle deaths were the result of rapid deceleration blunt force trauma to an erstwhile airborne bovine.\nWhile parachuting cows may not be a known problem in the state, Arizona DOT does have an official road sign to warn drivers about ground-based cattle. The official sign features the same black cow as shown in the picture above, minus the UFO / parachute.\nHere's an example of the real Arizona cow sign:\nThe parachuting cow sign is, oddly enough, not the first such sign to grace the roads of Arizona. Here's a picture from photographer Tom Story showing a slightly different design of an unofficial Arizona road sign:\nStory wrote on Instagram that this photograph was taken near an airport in Coolidge, Arizona, sometime in the 1980s. The airport, according to Story, was an \"international center for skydiving for several decades.\" It seems plausible that some skydiver found the idea of a parachuting cow to be humorous and altered the sign.\nStory wrote: \"Throwback Thursday to the airport at Coolidge, AZ in the 1980s when this sign was along the road. The airfield was originally an Army Air Corps facility built in the Second World War and was an international center for skydiving for several decades. Scanned from the original color transparency.\"",

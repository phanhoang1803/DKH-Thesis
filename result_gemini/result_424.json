      "explanation": "The statement is plausible.  Celebrations following election results are common. Kinshasa is the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, making it a likely location for such an event. However, without specific details about the election, the date, and independent news reports confirming the celebrations, the claim remains somewhat uncertain.",
      "supporting_points": "Knowledge that elections often lead to celebrations among supporters of winning candidates; Kinshasa is the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Congo and thus a likely place for major political celebrations; lack of specific election details makes full verification impossible without further evidence.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check expresses low confidence (confidence_score: 3) because the image lacks definitive proof of the location being Kinshasa, Congo. Although the image shows people celebrating, it doesn't provide specifics like election details or any location markers. The external check has a higher confidence (confidence_score: 8), primarily because celebrations after election results are common, and Kinshasa is a major city in the DRC, making it a plausible location for such an event. However, the external check acknowledges a lack of verifiable details like specific election information and supporting news reports to confirm the event.  The conflict between the internal and external checks arises because the internal check focuses on the lack of visual evidence for the location, while the external check considers the plausibility of the scenario. To resolve this conflict, we need to prioritize the internal check's focus on the visual evidence. The image itself does not provide confirmation of the location or the event. While the external check makes a plausible argument, it lacks conclusive evidence to support the claim. Therefore, considering the available evidence, the caption is likely Out Of Context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check flags low confidence due to lack of location specificity in the image. External check shows higher confidence based on the plausibility of post-election celebrations in Kinshasa but lacks definitive supporting evidence. The final assessment leans towards 'Out Of Context' due to insufficient visual evidence confirming the location and event details."

        "content": "Claim:\nA photograph shows U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who lost both of his arms because the president knew the man couldn't shake hands.\nRating:\nMiscaptioned\nAbout this rating\nA photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran who had lost both of his arms is frequently shared on social media:\nThis photo is often accompanied by the claim that the pictured Trump supporter is a veteran. Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \"President Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\"\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \"Here's a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\"\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \"Bubba\" Stevenson Jr. We're not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair's meeting.\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man's face:\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\nHenry Bubba Stevenson Jr. has a unique tattoo on his left arm.\nThe ink could be referred to as a billion dollar tat. Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump autographed Stevensons prosthetic arm at a Trump rally at Winthrop University on Jan. 8.\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson's face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \"only a nub below his shoulder.\" A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \"was born without arms\" and featured a photograph of him as a child.\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\nFor the first time in his life, Henry Bubba Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it's not your everyday handshake ... it's bionic!\nStevenson, 23, was fitted with a 1-limb ultra bionic arm on Sept. 22.\nStevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder.\nAs a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks.\nAnd now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \"learn to drive and to be more independent\" and had a long-term goal of getting a job.",

      "explanation": "The news caption states that President Trump touched the face of a U.S. veteran who lost both arms.  Source 1 confirms that a photo exists of Trump touching the face of a man with prosthetic arms. However, Source 1 explicitly debunks the claim that this man was a veteran.  The caption's assertion that Trump knew the man couldn't shake hands is not directly confirmed or denied, but the context implies a gesture of compassion based on the man's condition, which is inaccurate given the man wasn't a veteran.  The caption is partially true (the touching of the face occurred), but the description is inaccurate regarding the man's veteran status.",
      "supporting_points": "Source 1: Confirms the photograph's existence. Source 1: States that the man in the photo was not a veteran. Source 1: The caption's suggestion of Trump's knowledge of the man's inability to shake hands is not directly addressed.",

    "explanation": "The internal check gives a confidence score of 8, noting that the image shows President Trump interacting with someone who appears to have prosthetic arms. The caption accurately describes Trump's gesture as a compassionate touch to the face and correctly identifies Trump. However, it makes an inference about the recipient being a U.S. veteran and mentions the inability to shake hands.  These points are not explicitly shown in the image and require external verification. The external check also provides a confidence score of 8, but delivers a different verdict. This check confirms the existence of the photograph and notes the interaction between Trump and a man with prosthetic arms. However, this external check reveals a crucial discrepancy: The man was not a veteran. This directly contradicts a key claim in the caption. The caption's implication regarding Trump knowing about the man's inability to shake hands and acting in compassion is also not supported by the external source. There is a conflict between the internal and external checks. The internal check focuses on the image's content and its alignment with the caption's description of Trump's action, but it fails to verify the factual claim that the person was a veteran. The external check focuses on confirming the key entities (Trump, the action) and the underlying factual claim (veteran status).  Because the external check is based on external sources that corroborate or refute the caption's claims about the identities and the situation, this check is weighted more heavily than the internal check. Considering both checks, the caption's claims that the recipient is a U.S. veteran and Trump's knowledge of his inability to shake hands are not supported. This makes the caption out of context. Although Trump's touching the man's face is correct, other parts of the caption are inaccurate. The confidence score is 8 because both checks agree on Trump's action but the external check strongly refutes the core factual claim about the veteran status. The external source significantly reduces the certainty because it provides evidence contradicting the crucial claim of veteran status.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check identifies the main elements correctly but fails to verify factual claims about the man. External check confirms Trump's action but refutes the claim that the person was a veteran, making the caption out of context. The external check is weighted more heavily due to its external validation."

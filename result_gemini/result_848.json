        "content": "Claim:\nSetting your Apple device's date to 1 January 1970 will reveal a retro-themed Easter egg.\nIn February 2016, a rumor began to spread that iPhones and iPads contain a nifty Easter egg: If you set the date of your Apple product to 1 January 1970 then reboot, it will bring up a retro-themed menu based on the old Apple computer operating systems.\nText on the image read:\nBlast from the past\nThe original Macintosh introduced the world to computers, forever changing the way people experience technology, and allowing people to do things that were never possible before. With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, its a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phones date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablets operating system that youll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't. Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so theres not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, its possible  at least in theory  that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says its looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.",

    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) that the caption aligns with the image, as the image displays an Apple device with the date set to January 1, 1970. However, the external check reveals a significant discrepancy.  The external check, using Snopes.com as a source, strongly contradicts (confidence score of 2) the caption's claim, stating that setting the date to January 1, 1970 is a hoax and may damage the device. This directly opposes the caption's assertion about a retro Easter egg. The conflict between these two checks, with the external check having credible evidence from Snopes.com, leads to a final verdict of 'out of context'. The high internal confidence score is overridden by the strong external evidence debunking the claim.\n\nThe discrepancy arises from the caption's focus on a positive outcome (a retro Easter egg) versus the Snopes source which indicates a potentially negative consequence (device damage). There's no supporting evidence in the image itself for the Easter egg claim, rendering the internal confidence score less reliable than the external evidence.  The image only demonstrates the act of setting the date; it does not show any Easter egg. The external check thus provides crucial context that is missing from both the image and caption. The Snopes source directly addresses the common misconception presented in the caption and provides a factual counter-narrative.\n\nIn summary, while the image internally aligns with part of the caption (setting the date), it lacks the supporting evidence for the ‘retro Easter egg’ claim. The high confidence of the internal check is outweighed by the strong external evidence disproving the caption's core assertion.  Therefore, the caption is ultimately deemed out of context.  The high confidence score reflects the strong evidence from both checks, with the external check holding more weight due to its direct counter-evidence from a reliable source.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence in image-caption alignment. External check strongly contradicts the caption, citing Snopes.com which debunks the Easter egg claim.  The external evidence overrides internal assessment, concluding the caption is out of context."

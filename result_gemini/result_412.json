        "content": "Claim:\nTelevangelist Joel Osteen endorsed Donald Trump.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nOn 7 October 2015, televangelist Joel Osteen made an appearance on the Kilmeade And Friendsradio show, during which Osteen said that he understood Trump's \"make our country great again\" message:\nI think [the message] resonates to, Hey, maybe the country is not where it should be. Lets get back to where we were. Like you said, Mr. Trump is an incredible communicator and brander, like Mr. Clinton said. Hes been a friend of our ministry. Hes a good man.\nSeveral months after Osteen's appearance on the Kilmeade and Friends show, his comments began to recirculate under misleading headlines which insinuated that that Osteen had officially endorsed Trump for president. For example, entertainment web site Evenin-Tea.com published a video of Osteen's comments under the title \"Guess Whos Endorsing Trump, Joel Freaking Osteen  You Done Yet? This Latest Trump Endorsement Is Gonna Rock Some Worlds.\"\nWhile Osteen's admiring comments fell far short of an actual endorsement, the televangelist still found it necessary to clarify his political position. In March 2016, his church released a statement:\nContrary to the misinformation currently making the rounds on social media, Pastor Joel Osteen has not endorsed any candidate for President of the United States.\nPreacher and televangelist Joel Osteen is the pastor at Houston-based Lakewood Church, the one of the largest in the United States.",

      "explanation": "The provided text from Snopes explicitly states that Joel Osteen did not endorse Donald Trump, despite circulating misinformation suggesting otherwise.  Osteen's comments were complimentary but did not constitute an endorsement.  Snopes cites Osteen's church statement denying an endorsement as evidence.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check analyzes the image and caption for consistency. The image shows Joel Osteen, but the caption claims he endorsed Donald Trump.  The image itself provides no evidence of such an endorsement.  The internal check thus concludes the caption is likely out of context, with a confidence score of 10. The external check corroborates this by citing a Snopes fact-check that directly refutes the claim of Osteen endorsing Trump. Snopes provides evidence that Osteen has denied such an endorsement, and that statements attributed to him were complimentary but did not constitute an endorsement. The external check also reaches a conclusion that the caption is out of context, assigning a confidence score of 8.  Both internal and external checks strongly agree that the caption is out of context. The discrepancy in confidence scores (10 vs 8) is minor, and both are high. This convergence significantly strengthens the conclusion. There is no conflict or uncertainty; both checks support the same conclusion using different methods. The entity analysis aligns with both checks as it confirms the presence of Joel Osteen in the image and the absence of any explicit evidence of an endorsement of Donald Trump. Given the high confidence scores and complete agreement between both validation methods, the final confidence score is 9. In summary, the caption is clearly out of context because it asserts a fact not supported by the image or reliable external sources.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks independently and strongly agree that the caption 'Televangelist Joel Osteen endorsed Donald Trump' is out of context. The image shows only Joel Osteen and contains no evidence of an endorsement.  External verification confirms that credible sources refute the claim of endorsement."

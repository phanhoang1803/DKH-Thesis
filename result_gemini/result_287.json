      "explanation": "While videos circulating on TikTok showing purported UFOs are common,  verifying their authenticity and determining if they actually depict alien spaceships is extremely difficult. The claim is plausible in that such videos frequently appear online, but there's no independent verification of their origin, content, or whether they show what they claim.  The lack of reliable evidence to support the claim of an alien spaceship lowers confidence.",
      "supporting_points": "- Social media platforms like TikTok often host user-generated content of questionable origin.\n- Many videos claiming to show UFOs are misidentified objects, natural phenomena, or hoaxes.\n- There is no credible scientific evidence supporting the existence of alien spaceships visiting Earth. \n- Confirmation of such a claim requires thorough investigation by credible sources.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The internal check and the external check both agree that the caption is inaccurate. The image clearly shows a Goodyear Blimp, a well-known advertising airship, not an alien spaceship or UFO. The internal check points out the mismatch between the image content (a Goodyear Blimp) and the caption's claim (an alien spaceship/UFO). The confidence score of 2 reflects this clear discrepancy.  The external check further supports this assessment, emphasizing the difficulty of verifying UFO claims on social media and the lack of credible evidence for alien spaceships visiting Earth. The confidence score of 4 indicates a strong degree of certainty that the caption is false. There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; they both concur that the caption is out of context. The external check provides additional context about the prevalence of misidentified objects in UFO videos on platforms like TikTok, and the lack of reliable evidence to support claims of alien spaceships.  This enhances the overall confidence in the conclusion that the caption is inaccurate and out of context.  The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong agreement and substantial evidence supporting the conclusion.  The entity alignment analysis clearly shows a mismatch between the visual entity (Goodyear Blimp) and the caption's entities (alien spaceship, UFO, TikTok). There is no need for further validation or speculation as the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly support the conclusion that the caption is out of context. The image shows a Goodyear Blimp, not an alien spaceship, and the external check highlights the unreliable nature of UFO claims on social media."

    "confidence_score": 9,
    "explanation": "The caption states that a double rainbow was framed over the arc of Glasgow's famous squinty bridge.  The internal check gives a confidence score of 10 because the image clearly shows a double rainbow over a bridge that is identified as the \"squinty bridge\", and the location as Glasgow. The external check provides a confidence score of 8, acknowledging that double rainbows are a real phenomenon, the Squinty Bridge is a real location, and the scenario depicted is plausible. However, it notes a lack of specific meteorological data to confirm the event.  There's a slight discrepancy in terminology: the caption refers to the bridge as the \"squinty bridge\" while the internal check acknowledges that the name isn't explicitly in the caption. This difference is minor and doesn't impact the overall assessment.  The external validation highlights the inherent limitation in verifying the exact timing and occurrence of meteorological events without additional information. Both internal and external validations agree on the core factsâ€”a double rainbow, the bridge, and the location.  The high confidence scores (10 and 8) in both checks significantly contribute to the overall high confidence level of 9. Considering the plausible scenario, visual evidence, and the acknowledgment of the limitations in verifying exact meteorological occurrences, the caption is deemed reasonably accurate and not out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's accuracy.  The internal check finds strong visual alignment, while the external check acknowledges the plausibility of the event but notes the lack of specific meteorological confirmation. The minor discrepancy in terminology doesn't affect the overall assessment."

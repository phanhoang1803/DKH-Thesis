        "content": "Claim:\nTed Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident.\nOn 28 April 2017, a number of unreliable web sites began publishing stories reporting that rock musician and conservative icon Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident in Montana:\nTed Nugent, 70s rocker turned hunting guide and conservative icon, was shot and killed early this morning in a tragic hunting accident. While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.\nThere are no legitimate news reports of any ill fate befalling Nugent  in fact, he made a Facebook Live video with his wife Shermane on the same afternoon the death hoax starting circulating, in which they confirmed he is indeed alive and well:\nShe posted another live video a few minutes later in which her husband's voice could be heard while she played with the couple's dogs:\nNugent's spokeswoman Linda Peterson also confirmed in an e-mail that reports of Nugent's untimely death were \"fake news.\"\nNugent is famous for his rock career, but has also become an outspoken supporter of conservative political figures, such as former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and President Donald Trump. He most recently made news when he was pictured alongside Palin and fellow rock singer Kid Rock at the White House, where they all dined with President Trump. Nugent is also a divisive figure due to comments he has made about former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that have been characterized as racist, sexist and potentially inciting violence.",

Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks this claim, stating that reports of Nugent's death were a hoax.  The article presents evidence showing Nugent was alive and well, including a Facebook Live video with his wife.",

    "explanation": "Both the internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption, \"Ted Nugent was killed in a Montana hunting accident,\" is completely out of context. The image clearly shows Ted Nugent alive and performing. The internal check points out this discrepancy with high confidence (confidence_score: 10).  The external check reinforces this by referencing a Snopes fact-check that debunks the death rumor, citing a Facebook Live video as evidence of Nugent being alive.  The external check also has a high confidence score (confidence_score: 10).  There is no conflict between the internal and external checks; both unequivocally refute the caption's claim.  The alignment between the image's content and the checks' results is perfect; the image depicts a living Ted Nugent, while the caption falsely announces his death.  Therefore, there is no uncertainty; the caption is definitively false and out of context.",

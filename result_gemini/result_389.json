      "explanation": "The statement is plausible given the historical context of US-China trade negotiations under the Trump administration.  Extended talks and positive statements from Trump regarding trade negotiations were common during that period. However, the exact details of the specific event mentioned would require verification through news archives from that time to confirm the date, the specific envoys involved, and the precise wording of Trump's statement.",
      "supporting_points": "- During the Trump administration, there were multiple rounds of high-stakes trade talks between the US and China.\n- President Trump frequently made public statements about the progress of these negotiations, some positive and some negative. \n- It is plausible that talks extended into a third day and that Trump expressed optimism, but requires further verification to confirm the specifics of this particular event.",

    "confidence_score": 2,
    "explanation": "The internal consistency check has a confidence score of 0 because the image depicts the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, and the caption mentions U.S. and Chinese envoys and President Trump, none of which are present in the image.  The external check has a confidence score of 8, indicating that the statement in the caption is plausible given the historical context of US-China trade talks under the Trump administration.  However, it lacks specific details to confirm this particular event. There is a significant discrepancy between the internal and external checks. The internal check strongly suggests that the caption is out of context because of the lack of visual alignment, while the external check indicates a degree of plausibility based on historical context. Because the image provides no evidence of the event described in the caption, and the external validation relies on general plausibility rather than specific verification, we must prioritize the internal validation.  The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty due to the conflicting results and the absence of concrete evidence to support the caption's claims. The image only shows a building; it offers no information about the specific trade talks mentioned in the caption.  Therefore, the caption is determined to be out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows no visual alignment between the image and caption, resulting in a confidence score of 0.  External check suggests plausibility based on historical context but lacks specific verification, yielding a confidence score of 8. Due to the lack of visual evidence in the image, and the absence of specific verifiable details in the external check, the caption is deemed out of context."

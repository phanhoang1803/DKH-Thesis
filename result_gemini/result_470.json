    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 8,
    "explanation": "The internal and external checks both agree that the caption is largely accurate, but lack definitive proof for the exact claim regarding the specific sculpture at the specified location. The internal check flags uncertainty about the exact location of the castle, while the external check verifies the existence of the castle but not the presence of the specific sculpture. Both checks highlight the need for external verification to confirm the presence of the described sculpture at Castello di Vezio (the corrected name). The slight discrepancy in the castle's name between the caption and external knowledge is minor.  The high confidence scores (8 out of 10 for both checks) stem from the plausibility of the core elements: plaster sculptures exist; Castello di Vezio is a real castle in a location consistent with the image; and the image shows a sculpture that appears to be made of plaster. However, the lack of definitive proof regarding the specific sculpture's presence at Castello di Vezio necessitates caution.  A conservative estimate of confidence is warranted given the lack of complete evidence. While not definitively proven, it is highly probable based on the available evidence that the caption is largely correct, barring the minor misspelling and the absence of absolute confirmation about the particular sculpture depicted in the image.  The explanation accounts for the reasonable doubt arising from the lack of conclusive external verification regarding the precise sculpture's presence at Castello di Vezio. Therefore, while the caption is likely to be accurate, the lack of absolute certainty results in a confidence score of 8 instead of a higher value.  A careful weighing of the plausibility and the absence of complete verification is performed. The decision to not mark OOC as true reflects the overall high plausibility supported by both internal and external validations, with the caveat of the lack of definitive proof on the specific details regarding the sculpture.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks show high confidence in the core elements of the caption (plaster sculpture, Lake Como, Italy). However, neither conclusively verifies the specific sculpture's presence at Castello di Vezio.  Minor name discrepancy exists in the caption. Overall plausibility is high, but complete certainty is lacking."

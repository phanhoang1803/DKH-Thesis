It said:\nFrom December 2016, it will be ILLEGAL to use a backless booster seat with a child under 12.\nBackless booster seats will only be permitted for children:\n-over 12 years old\n-taller than 125 cm\n-heavier than 22kg\nWhile the meme did not specify what country passed these new guidelines, the use of the metric system (kilograms, centimeters) rather than the older Imperial system used by the United States (pounds, inches) appeared to be the first clue that this would not affect Americans.\nIn April 2016, the Independent reported that a new law was being considered in the United Kingdom (not the U.S.) which would prevent children below a certain height and weight from sitting in backless booster seats while traveling in a car:\nBackless booster seats will be banned for children below a certain height and weight, under new laws due to come in later this year.\nThe new rules will limit the use of backless booster seats among smaller children, as they are deemed unsafe by experts.\nFrom December 2016, all children under 125cm and weighing less than 22kg must have a high-backed booster seat while travelling in a car.\nCurrently, children who weigh 15kg are able to travel in backless booster seats  also known as booster cushions - but experts believe this type of car seat is unsuitable for younger children.\nHowever, even that it is inaccurate; local news organizations reported that the legislation was delayed for several months, until March 2017. Several outlets also referred to the new law as a \"backless booster seat ban,\" further confusing the issue. However, this is also inaccurate, as the legislation is actually geared toward manufacturers and will only affect new products:\nSo although the safety guidelines will change - and child car seat experts agree this type of backless booster seat is unsuitable for such young children - those continuing to use one will not face any action.\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"New booster cushions without a backrest will only be able to be approved as Group 3 products, i.e. for children over 125cm or 22kg.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is directly quoted from a social media meme that falsely claimed backless booster seats would be illegal for children under 12 in the US starting in December 2016.  The Snopes article debunks this claim, showing that the meme's origin is unclear and the information is inaccurate. While the UK did consider a similar law, it did not affect the US and had a later implementation date.  The meme's use of the metric system also hints at its inaccuracy for the US context.",

    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the caption's factual accuracy based solely on the image content and its apparent relation to child car seat safety.  It concludes that the caption is accurate because it reflects a common concern related to child safety regulations. However, this assessment lacks crucial external verification. The external check reveals that the caption is a widely circulated misinformation meme debunked by fact-checking websites. This meme falsely claims a specific date (December 2016) for a ban on backless booster seats for children under 12, specifically in the US context. The meme's origin is unclear, and the claim is inaccurate.  While some countries may have regulations regarding backless booster seat usage, the specified date and claim's universality across jurisdictions is not supported by evidence. Therefore, a crucial discrepancy exists between the internal and external validation results. The external validation, supported by fact-checking resources, carries more weight due to its comprehensive investigation and verification process.  The internal assessment, while seemingly plausible given the image, is flawed due to its limited scope and lack of access to reliable regulatory information. The high confidence score (9) reflects the strong evidence from the external validation and the clear contradiction with the internal assessment.  The external evidence demonstrates that the statement in the caption is fundamentally incorrect, not simply outdated.  The image, while seemingly relatable to the topic of child car seat safety, is insufficient to validate the misinformation presented in the caption. In summary, the caption is out of context because it propagates a false claim about child car seat regulations.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation mistakenly deemed the caption accurate based only on image context. External validation definitively proved the caption to be a debunked misinformation meme, highlighting a significant discrepancy. External validation, supported by fact-checking, outweighs the limited internal assessment."

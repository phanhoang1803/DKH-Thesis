    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly indicate that the original caption, \"An actual \\\"pink volcano\\\" erupting in New Zealand,\" is inaccurate and out of context. The internal check highlights a discrepancy: while the image depicts a plume of pink and purple smoke resembling a volcanic eruption, it does not confirm the location (New Zealand) or the authenticity of the event as a naturally occurring phenomenon.  The confidence score of 8 reflects this uncertainty regarding location and natural origin. However, the external check provides definitive evidence from Snopes.com, a reputable fact-checking website. Snopes's investigation revealed that the video (and likely the image) depicting the pink volcanic eruption is digitally manipulated, not a genuine event.  The fact-check provides substantial evidence that the video was created by an artist, Filip Hodas, using digital art techniques. The confidence score of 10 for the external check highlights the certainty of this information, supported by cited sources and detailed explanation of the video's creation.  The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the external evidence. Since the external check conclusively proves the event was digitally fabricated, the original caption is demonstrably false.  The high confidence scores from both checks (8 and 10), coupled with the conclusive external evidence, lead to a final confidence score of 10, reflecting the high certainty that the caption is out of context. No ambiguity remains regarding the authenticity of the image or its representation of a real pink volcanic eruption in New Zealand.  The external evidence directly refutes the claim made in the caption.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation strongly reject the caption. Internal validation notes visual resemblance to a volcanic eruption but lacks location and authenticity confirmation. External validation definitively proves the image is digitally manipulated, not a real event, based on Snopes's fact-check. The final assessment is that the caption is out of context."

The use of such a racial slur by a public figure would be highly publicized and likely to have immediate and significant consequences. The absence of substantial reporting makes this claim highly improbable.",

    "explanation": "The claim that President Biden used the N-word during the Munich Security Conference is demonstrably false based on both internal and external evidence. The internal check correctly identifies a mismatch between the image (showing President Biden giving a seemingly formal speech) and the caption's claim (alleging the use of a racial slur). The low confidence score reflects the image's limitations in definitively ruling out the possibility of such an event occurring off-camera or at a different time. However, the external check provides strong corroboration. The absence of any credible news reports or public statements supporting the claim, coupled with the highly public nature of such an event and the immediate consequences it would entail, overwhelmingly refute the caption's assertion. The discrepancy between the internal check's slightly lower confidence and the external check's higher confidence is resolved by considering the context. While the image itself does not explicitly disprove the caption, the lack of supporting evidence in the external world makes the claim highly improbable. The absence of any reporting on such a significant event from reputable news sources is highly unusual and casts significant doubt on the caption's veracity. Therefore, both internal and external checks align in rejecting the caption, concluding that it is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks strongly indicate that the caption is out of context.  The image shows President Biden speaking, but offers no evidence of the alleged slur.  External verification reveals a complete lack of credible reporting to support the claim."

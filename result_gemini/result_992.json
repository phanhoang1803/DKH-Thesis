    "explanation": "Both internal and external validation checks strongly support the accuracy of the caption. The internal check highlights the image's depiction of bleached corals, aligning with the caption's statement about rising ocean temperatures causing such bleaching.  The external check corroborates this by referencing scientific consensus on the link between rising ocean temperatures and coral bleaching, citing documented bleaching events in Papua New Guinea as further evidence.  There are no discrepancies between the internal and external checks; both independently confirm the caption's accuracy with high confidence scores. The alignment of the caption with the visual content of the image and the established scientific understanding of coral bleaching leads to a high level of certainty regarding the caption's validity.  No evidence suggests the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks confirm the caption's accuracy. The image shows bleached coral, consistent with the caption's explanation that rising ocean temperatures cause this. External sources confirm this scientific fact and document similar events in Papua New Guinea."

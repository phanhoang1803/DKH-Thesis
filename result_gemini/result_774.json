The death of a bystander in such a scenario is also unfortunately plausible. However, without specific details about the location and time, it's hard to definitively confirm this incident.  Many news stories report on such events, but confirming the specifics of a particular incident may require further verification from reliable sources.",

    "confidence_score": 4,
    "explanation": "The internal check identified a significant discrepancy: the image shows police officers with shotguns, not the less-lethal weapons (rubber bullets, stun grenades, and tear gas) mentioned in the caption.  Furthermore, there is no visual evidence in the image to support the claim of a passerby being killed. The internal check's low confidence score (6) reflects this lack of visual corroboration. The external check, while acknowledging the plausibility of police using less-lethal weapons and a bystander being killed during protests, also highlights the difficulty in definitively verifying the specific incident depicted in the image without additional information such as location and time.  The external check's confidence score (7) is based on the general plausibility of the events described, not on direct evidence from the image itself.  Because the image does not depict the events described in the caption (rubber bullets, stun grenades, tear gas, and a fatality), there's a significant mismatch.  The internal and external checks, while having different confidence scores, both indicate that there's insufficient evidence to confirm the accuracy of the caption.  The high degree of discrepancy between the image content and the caption's description warrants labeling the caption as out of context (OOC). The low confidence score of 4 reflects the uncertainty due to the image showing only armed police and not the events described in the caption. While the external check suggests the caption's scenario is plausible in the general context of protests and civil unrest, it doesn't confirm that this specific image depicts that scenario.  In summary, the significant discrepancy between the image content and the caption, coupled with the lack of specific details to confirm the broader narrative, leads to a low confidence score and the conclusion that the caption is out of context.  The external check's plausibility assessment doesn't outweigh the visual mismatch presented by the internal check.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check finds the caption inconsistent with the image content (lack of rubber bullets, stun grenades, tear gas, and evidence of a fatality). External check finds the caption's scenario plausible but lacks specific details to verify the image's context.  Significant discrepancies result in a low confidence score and OOC judgment."

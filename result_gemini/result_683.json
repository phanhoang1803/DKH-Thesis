There were significant protests at that time, involving interactions between civilians and security forces. However, without a verifiable source like a photograph or news report confirming this specific event, it is difficult to assess its accuracy definitively. The event could have happened, but there's no readily available information to confirm or deny it.",
      "supporting_points": "- August 2020 saw large-scale protests in Belarus following a disputed presidential election.\n- These protests frequently involved confrontations, but also instances of interaction between protestors and security forces, some of which may have been amicable.\n- Verifying this specific event requires corroboration from news articles or photographic evidence from that date and location.",

  "final_result": {

    "confidence_score": 5,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows some confidence in the caption's accuracy due to the visual alignment of the image with the description: a woman embracing a soldier who appears to be Belarusian. However, the lack of clear uniform markings and location markers in the image creates uncertainty. The external check highlights this uncertainty, stating that while the scenario is plausible given the political climate in Belarus in August 2020, there is no definitive evidence to confirm this specific event.  The external check's lower confidence score reflects the absence of corroborating evidence from news reports or other reliable sources.  The conflict between the internal and external checks stems from the limitations of image-based verification. While the image itself might be consistent with the caption's description, this is not sufficient to definitively prove the caption's accuracy without external verification. The external check correctly points out that while the context is plausible, pinpointing this specific event to the date, time, and location mentioned requires additional evidence.  Therefore, considering the low confidence of the external check and the uncertainty highlighted by both checks, the overall confidence score is lowered. The lack of external verification makes it impossible to definitively confirm the caption, leading to an 'out of context' assessment.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows some visual alignment but lacks definitive proof. External check highlights the lack of corroborating evidence.  Discrepancy arises from the limitation of image-only verification. Overall low confidence due to insufficient evidence."

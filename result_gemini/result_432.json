        "content": "Claim:\nActress Jodie Foster said that attacking the rich is not envy, it's self-defense.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nAn image featuring a picture of actress Jodie Foster alongside a quote ostensibly uttered by her about wealth disparity in the United States being the cause of poverty is frequently circulated on social media:\nAttacking the rich is not envy. It is self defense. The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren't just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\nThis quote did not originate with Jodie Foster, however.\nOne of the earliest version of this statement we've found so far was posted in February 2016 to the TJshome.com website in the \"Funny Status Message\" section. But it was not attributed to Jodie Foster there, and that section of the site is full of generic statements that are preceded by the words \"X says,\" indicating that users can attribute a quote to anyone they choose:\nTwitter user @buddhUU reached out to us aand noted that they had posted this message in June 2014:\nThe original message from @buddhUU was not attributed to Jodie Foster, either.\nSo this denunciation of the rich started as a generic bit that was later attached to Jodie Foster's name in order to lend it additional credence. Foster's actual views on capitalism and wealth disparity are a little more nuanced than those expressed above:",

      "explanation": "The provided evidence from Snopes explicitly debunks the claim that Jodie Foster said, \"Attacking the rich is self-defense.\"  Snopes demonstrates that this quote is falsely attributed to her, originating from an unattributed online post and later associated with Foster to gain credibility.  Therefore, the news caption is inaccurate.",

    "OOC": true,
    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check focuses solely on the presence of Jodie Foster in the image and the mention of her name in the caption. This check yields a high confidence score (10) because the image clearly depicts Jodie Foster, and the caption correctly identifies her. However, the external check provides crucial contextual information.  Snopes, a reputable fact-checking website, explicitly debunks the claim that Jodie Foster made the statement \"Attacking the rich is self-defense.\"  The external check also provides high confidence (10) because it presents evidence tracing the quote's origin to an unattributed online post and demonstrates its false attribution to Jodie Foster. This discrepancy highlights a significant conflict between internal and external validation. While the image aligns with the caption in terms of the person depicted, the caption's claim about the quote is factually incorrect according to external evidence.  The high confidence scores from both internal and external checks, combined with the conflicting results, allow for a strong conclusion. The external evidence decisively overrides the limited scope of the internal assessment. Therefore, the caption is out of context because it falsely attributes a quote to Jodie Foster, despite the image accurately showing her.  In summary, the analysis prioritizes the robust external validation from a trusted source (Snopes) over the internal alignment limited to the image's content. The weight of evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the caption is out of context.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check confirms Jodie Foster's presence in the image, scoring high confidence. However, external fact-checking reveals the quote is falsely attributed to her, also scoring high confidence.  The external evidence refutes the caption's claim, leading to an 'out of context' conclusion."

By precooking it and blending it in a special way, he was able to make a fully cooked 100% bacon paste that could be squeezed from a tube. Knowing he had discovered something paradigm-shifting, young Vilhelm Lilleflsk quickly went into business. That, dear friends, is when Squeez Bacon was born. And this delicious delectable from Sweden has finally been brought over to the USA - now with American Flavor!\nBoth Squeez Bacon and Vilhelm Lilleflsk are made-up entities created for ThinkGeek's annual April Fools' Day fake product launch. A November 2009 New York Times Magazine piece referencing Squeez Bacon described that tradition, which began in 2001:\nOn April 1 of each year since 2001, ThinkGeek, the online retailer, has devoted its home page to products that dont exist. The names sound unlikely  Squeez Bacon, Surgestix Inhalable Caffeine Stix, p-Teqs USB Pregnancy Test Kit, etc.  but they are presented as any item on the site would be: catalog description and list of features, pictures, maybe a video, price, Buy Now button. Click that and . . . ThinkGeek wishes you a happy April Fools Day.\nAccording to an April 2, 2009, story on the website Bacon Today, this is the image people attempting to procure Squeez Bacon would have seen had they added the product to their cart:\nDespite the fact that ThinkGeek  a website famous for its fake April Fools' Day products  explicitly stated that the product was not real 12 years ago, there remains confusion online as to the feasibility of buying a tube of Squeez Bacon. A Jan. 30, 2021, Reddit post in the \"Thanks I Hate It\" subreddit brought renewed attention to the fake product.\nUnfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your viewpoint) the product remains fictional. As such, the claim is \"False.\"",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check assesses the caption's accuracy based solely on the provided image. The image depicts a product labeled \"Squeez Bacon,\" appearing to be bacon paste in a tube. This leads to a high confidence score (10) that the caption aligns with the image's content. However, the external check contradicts this assessment.  The external check uses a Snopes article as evidence to determine that \"Squeez Bacon\" is not a real product, but rather a fictional product created as an April Fool's Day joke by ThinkGeek.  This external evidence carries a high confidence score (10) as it provides direct factual information from a reputable source, thus refuting the caption's claim. The conflict between the internal and external checks is resolved by prioritizing the external evidence due to its higher reliability and factual basis. The Snopes article directly challenges the caption's core statement about the product's existence. Therefore, the final verdict is that the caption is out of context (OOC) because the claim about Squeez Bacon being a real product is false based on verifiable evidence from the Snopes article. The high confidence score (10) reflects the certainty of the external evidence debunking the caption's claim. The internal validation is based on a visual assessment, limited to the image's apparent content, while the external validation utilizes a reliable fact-checking source to verify the caption's claim regarding the existence of the product, making the external assessment more reliable.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal validation shows high confidence (10) that the caption matches the image content. External validation, using a Snopes article, shows high confidence (10) that the caption's claim is false, as 'Squeez Bacon' is a fictional product. The external evidence outweighs the internal, leading to an OOC verdict."

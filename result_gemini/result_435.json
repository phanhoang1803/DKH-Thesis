      "explanation": "The caption \"Mr. Tshisekedi with supporters on Thursday\" is plausible but lacks specific details for verification.  Felix Tshisekedi is a prominent figure, and it's common for political figures to appear with supporters. However, without specifying the date, location or the event, it's impossible to assess the claim's accuracy. The caption is not inherently implausible, but more information is needed to confirm its veracity.",

  "final_result": {
    "OOC": false,
    "confidence_score": 7,
    "explanation": "The internal check shows high confidence (10) in the caption's accuracy, stating that the image clearly depicts Mr. Tshisekedi with supporters. The external check, while also giving a positive verdict, expresses lower confidence (4), highlighting the lack of specific details like date, location, or event to independently verify the claim.  The discrepancy arises from the limited information available in the caption. The internal check relies heavily on visual analysis, while the external check emphasizes the need for contextual information to confirm the claim's validity.  Although the image strongly suggests the caption is accurate, the absence of external corroborating evidence reduces the overall confidence score.  The external check's concern is valid;  while the image depicts a person who strongly resembles Mr. Tshisekedi with what appear to be supporters, without additional information, we cannot definitively confirm the date or the specific event.  The external check correctly points out that, though plausible, the caption lacks specific verifiable details.  Therefore, while the visual evidence strongly supports the caption's plausibility, the lack of precise contextual information necessitates a more conservative overall confidence score.  The final score reflects a compromise between the high confidence of the internal check and the lower confidence but valid concerns of the external check.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check shows high confidence due to clear visual evidence, while external check expresses lower confidence due to the lack of specific details for verification. The final assessment reflects a balance of both viewpoints, acknowledging the visual evidence while also highlighting the need for more specific information."

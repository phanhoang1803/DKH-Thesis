      "explanation": "The image shows a mural depicting people wearing masks with different flags on them, representing a global population.  The caption mentions Denver Airport.  While the image itself does not explicitly show that it's from Denver Airport, it is possible that the image is from the Denver International Airport, so we cannot determine this from the image alone. The entities seem plausible given the image content, but the link to Denver Airport is uncertain.",

        "content": "Claim:\nAn image shows a mural painted in 1994 at Denver International Airport that shows citizens of the world wearing masks.\nIn June 2020, a photograph supposedly showing a mural that was painted at Denver International Airport in 1994 that depicted people from around the world wearing masks started to circulate on social media:\nLike many social media rumors about \"predictions,\" this image does not show a decades-old mural that foretold future events. Rather, this artwork is a modern day creation that is a reflection of COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic.\nWhile we haven't been able to definitively link an artist to this work (it has been attributed to more than one individual), it appears to have been created by CJ Trinidad. The earliest posting of this image that we could find was shared to Trinidad's Facebook page in February 2020 along with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\" Trinidad's Facebook page contains several other images of similar artworks, as well as a photograph of him posing with this piece:\nA community of Filipino educators also credited Trinidad as the artist behind \"Maskcommunication\" when they partnered with Trinidad to raise money for teachers who had been stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Filipino Teachers (TFT) wrote (emphasis ours):\nTFT (The Filipino Teachers, a community of Filipino teachers that aim to uplift and equip the overseas Filipino teacher) is undertaking a heart-filled project to help these teachers. In cooperation with up and rising Philippine artist CJ Trinidad, TFT invites you to support the TFT Bayanihan Project. This project aims to provide financial assistance to a maximum of 20 Filipino teachers who meet the beneficiary criteria of TFT. How can you help? Simply purchase one  or more!  of CJ Trinidads shirts and tote bags that feature his painting, Maskcommunication. CJ worked on this painting in the evenings after work for almost two weeks. The painting shows individuals wearing masks that represent different countries. He said that he wanted to show how communication, cooperation and unity play a vital role among the nations in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This painting has now garnered more than 7,000 reactions and 6,000 shares on Facebook This is your chance to own this meaningful work of art plus help a teacher in crisis!\nWhile the bulk of the evidence (including the signature visible in the photo above) indicates that Trinidad is the artist behind this modern artwork, this painting was instead credited to someone named Neha Kumari when it was submitted to an international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). We reached out to Trinidad and ICCR for more information about this painting. While its authorship is still a bit unclear, this viral image does not show a mural that was painted at the Denver International Airport in 1994.",

Snopes.com's fact-check directly addresses the claim that a 1994 Denver Airport mural depicts a masked global population.  The fact-check reveals the image is a modern artwork created by CJ Trinidad, not a decades-old mural.  The artwork's creation and initial online posting date to 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The internal check acknowledges the image depicts a global population wearing masks, aligning with the caption's core description. However, it expresses uncertainty about the image's origin (Denver Airport), which is a crucial part of the caption's claim. The external check decisively refutes the caption's claim.  It identifies the image as a modern artwork, not a 1994 Denver Airport mural, providing strong evidence from Snopes.com's fact-check. This directly contradicts the caption's assertion. The high confidence score (10) from the external check, supported by a reputable fact-checking source, outweighs the partial alignment and uncertainty of the internal check.  The discrepancy lies in the temporal and locational aspects of the image's origin. The internal check couldn't confirm or deny the Denver Airport connection, leaving it as an unverified element. The external check explicitly debunks this aspect, clarifying the artwork's modern creation and lack of connection to the Denver Airport mural.  The fact-check provides verifiable information about the artwork's creator and creation date, making it a far more reliable source than the initial visual inspection.  Therefore, given the strong external evidence contradicting the caption's key assertion, and the internal check's inability to independently verify the Denver Airport connection, the caption is deemed out of context. The external validation's confidence score of 10, indicating strong evidence against the caption, is adopted as the final confidence score.",
    "validation_summary": "Internal check partially aligns with the caption's description but expresses uncertainty about the Denver Airport origin. External check strongly refutes the caption's claim, identifying the image as a modern artwork unrelated to the specified Denver Airport mural.  The external evidence decisively outweighs the internal uncertainty, leading to the conclusion that the caption is out of context."

### Internal Checking Prompt
from typing import Optional


INTERNAL_CHECKING_PROMPT_WITH_EVIDENCE = """TASK: Assess whether internet-sourced images provide reasonable visual support for the given news caption and verify the accuracy of claims based on visual evidence.

INPUT:
- News Caption: {caption}
- News Content: {content}
- Detected Visual Entities: {visual_entities}
- Image Evidences: {image_evidences}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Cross-Verification: Compare the news caption/content with the sourced image evidence to identify consistencies or contradictions.
2. Image Source Assessment: Evaluate the credibility of image sources (domains) and the context in which these images appear.
3. Timeline Consistency: Verify that the image evidence matches the temporal aspects mentioned in the news.
4. Entity Verification: Confirm whether visual entities detected in internet images align with those mentioned in the news text.
5. Context Analysis: Determine if the sourced images are being used in their original context or potentially repurposed.
6. Contradiction Detection: Identify specific elements in the image evidence that contradict claims made in the news text.
7. Completeness Evaluation: Assess whether critical elements of the news narrative are supported by the available image evidence.
8. Visual Manipulation Assessment: Note any signs that sourced images may have been altered or manipulated.

NOTE: Consider both what is present and what is absent in the visual evidence. Images from different sources may show different perspectives of the same event or entirely different events.
"""

INTERNAL_CHECKING_PROMPT_WITHOUT_EVIDENCE = """TASK: Assess whether the news caption accurately represents the visual content based on the detected visual entities in the image.

INPUT:
- News Caption: {caption}
- News Content: {content}
- Detected Visual Entities: {visual_entities}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Entity Verification: Confirm whether visual entities detected in the image align with those mentioned in the news caption and content.
2. Consistency Analysis: Check if the relationships, quantities, and descriptions in the caption match what is detected in the image.
3. Context Evaluation: Determine if the context implied by the caption matches the visual scene represented by the detected entities.
4. Completeness Assessment: Identify if any critical elements mentioned in the caption are missing from the detected visual entities.
5. Contradiction Detection: Note any specific elements in the detected visual entities that directly contradict claims in the caption.
6. Confidence Evaluation: Consider the reliability of the entity detection and how it affects verification confidence.

NOTE: Focus solely on the relationship between the caption and the detected visual entities in the image. Base your assessment only on what can be objectively determined from this comparison.

INTERNAL_CHECKING_OUTPUT = """\nOUTPUT REQUIRED:
- "verdict": True/False
- "confidence_score": 0-10
- "explanation": A concise, evidence-based analysis (max 1000 words)

Where:
- verdict: "True" if the caption reasonably aligns with the visual entities and image evidences, "False" otherwise.
- confidence_score: A confidence level (0-10) indicating certainty in the verdict.
- explanation: A detailed assessment highlighting matches, inconsistencies, and reasoning between the news text and sourced images. Avoid assumptions and speculation.
"""


VISION_CHECKING_PROMPT = """TASK: Analyze the visual consistency between the news image and reference images retrieved from web results, which were searched using the caption. 
Differences in visual elements do not necessarily mean the image is misleadingâ€”consider whether it still represents the same event, location, or broader context.

INPUT:
- News Image: The main image being verified (First image in the list).
- Reference Images: Images retrieved from web search results based on the caption.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Compare key visual elements such as main subjects, objects, and overall composition to determine similarity with reference images.
2. Check for temporal consistency by analyzing lighting conditions, seasonal elements, and timestamps to detect potential time discrepancies.
3. Verify spatial relationships, including the scale, background environment, and positioning of objects, ensuring they align with the reference images.
4. Examine lighting and camera angles to identify inconsistencies in shadows, perspectives, or unnatural lighting conditions.
5. Detect possible manipulation by looking for artifacts, irregularities, or unnatural edits that suggest digital alterations.
6. Assess whether the images, despite visual differences, still refer to the same event, location, or broader context.
7. If the news image differs significantly from the reference images and does not appear to represent the same event or context, flag it as potentially misleading or out of context.

NOTE:
Only assess visible elements. Do not infer or assume additional context beyond what is present in the images. Clearly document any inconsistencies and indicate whether the image is visually different but still contextually relevant.

FINAL_CHECKING_PROMPT = """TASK: Determine whether a news caption accurately represents its accompanying image, considering potential misinformation, out-of-context usage, or falsified details.

CONTEXT:
- Internal Check: Evaluates whether internet-sourced images provide reasonable visual support for the news caption by comparing caption/content with sourced image evidence.
- External Check: Assesses the visual consistency between the news image and reference images retrieved from web searches based on the caption.

INPUT:
- News Caption: {news_caption}
- News Content: {news_content}
- Internal Check Result: {internal_result}
- External Check Result: {external_result}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Synthesize the internal and external validation results to form a comprehensive assessment.
2. Prioritize the validation method with significantly higher confidence scores when the checks conflict, but critically evaluate the specific evidence and reasoning behind each assessment before making a final determination.
3. When confidence scores are comparable but results differ, analyze the specific evidence provided by each method.
4. Weight alignment scores as a key indicator of the match between caption and image content.
5. Base the final decision strictly on available data; avoid inferring or assuming missing details.
6. If evidence is inconclusive or ambiguous, flag the case for further review.
7. Document any limitations, including uncertainties or missing information that may impact the decision.
8. For partially accurate captions, specify which elements are correct and which are misrepresented.
9. If either validation check lacks sufficient data, indicate this explicitly in your assessment.
10. Consider both the overall confidence scores and specific alignment scores for individual elements when weighing evidence.
11. If one validation method has a significantly higher confidence score while the other is very low, investigate the reasoning behind both results. Prioritize the stronger evidence but document the limitations of the weaker check. If the discrepancy suggests potential manipulation or missing data, flag the case for further review.

NOTE: Make the final verdict strictly based on the available evidence. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what is directly observable in the provided information.

- "explanation": Justification of the final result (max 500 words)

Where:
- OOC: "True" if the caption is out of context based on both internal and external checks, "False" otherwise.
- confidence_score: A confidence level (0-10) for the final decision.
- validation_summary: A brief summary highlighting key points of agreement or contradiction.
- explanation: A detailed reasoning process incorporating both internal and external validation. Clearly explain any discrepancies.

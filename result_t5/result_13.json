According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\nRobs a recreational diver, commented one of the injured mans friends. For some time, hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable web site BostonLeader.com, with the exception of the location and the man's name. BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version, IsThatLegit.com  where the story originated  clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only. Any resemblance to any real person, people, business, country, solar system or entity is unintentional.",

But Calgary police Constable Riley Babott tells The Associated Press theyve had no such complaints made to them in the last five years.\n___\nThis story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.",

      "explanation": "The news caption is False.  While both sources mention a story about a man losing his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke, both sources explicitly state that the story is a hoax. Source 1 (Snopes) clearly labels the original article as fiction, and Source 2 (AP News) confirms that the incident never occurred through police reports and image verification.",

    "confidence_score": 10,
    "explanation": "The original news caption, \"A man lost his testicles while attempting to fill a scuba tank with marijuana smoke,\" is demonstrably false and completely out of context with the provided image.  The internal check correctly identifies this mismatch, assigning a confidence score of 0 because there is no visual or textual evidence within the image itself to support the caption's claim.  The external check further strengthens this assessment, achieving a perfect confidence score of 10.  This high score is based on strong evidence from multiple reliable sources (Snopes and AP News) that definitively debunk the story as a hoax.  These sources not only label the original article as fiction but also provide crucial corroborating evidence, including the absence of any police reports or verifiable incidents matching the description in the caption. The image shows a damaged scuba tank and an emergency response scene, but there is nothing to suggest the bizarre event described in the caption. There is a complete disconnect between the image's content (a damaged scuba tank and emergency responders) and the caption's narrative (a man losing his testicles while trying to fill a tank with marijuana smoke).  The external validation, drawing on reputable fact-checking and news sources, eliminates any ambiguity and decisively confirms the caption's falsity.  Therefore, the combined internal and external checks leave no room for doubt; the caption is entirely fabricated and bears no relationship to the visual evidence. No visual tampering or miscontextualization is detected. The image seems to depict a genuine emergency response situation, possibly involving a scuba diving accident, which is completely unrelated to the false narrative of the caption.  There's no discrepancy between internal and external checks; both unanimously reject the caption's accuracy. This high level of agreement from multiple independent validation methods allows for a highly confident conclusion: the caption is out of context and completely false.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks conclusively determine that the news caption is false and out of context. The internal check finds no evidence in the image to support the claim, while the external check provides strong evidence from reputable sources that debunk the story as a hoax."

However, no taxpayer money was used for the first familys personal expenses.\nFULL QUESTION\nIs this true?\nMichelle Obama Takes Her Girls to London for Fish and Chips !!!\nOn Sunday, President Obama flew back to the United States on Air Force One. His wife, two daughters and her mother did a bit of shopping in Paris before taking their own Boeing 757 (C-32) over TO London to do some sight-seeing.\nNOTE: We all remember Obamas admonishment to corporate CEOs in February:\nYou cant get corporate jets, you cant go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayers dime.\nApparently that doesnt apply to his wife.\nThe London Times opened its description of Michelles visit this way:\nMotorcycle outriders, armoured Chevrolets and bullet-headed men in raincoats criss-crossed London yesterday as Michelle Obama and her daughters spent a second day on an unofficial visit to the capital.\nThe Times went on to describe that when Michelle and the girls arrived at Westminster Abbey, the building was closed to tourists with people already in told to wait against the wall. An American visiting the Abbey said Right then I knew it was probably someone from our royal family.\nMichelles motorcade shut down the London street above as the First Lady of the World and her children go for Fish and Chips at a pub in Mayfair . The entourage inside the restaurant was 15 people while dozens more wait outside. Include the dozens of Air Force personnel to fly and service the plane, embassy personnel and other staff and we are talking about a serious expenditure of tax payer dollars.\nMEANWHILE, millions of Americans have lost their jobs and wont be able to take their family on a summer vacation.\nBUT  Despite their circumstances theyll still be expected to fork over the tax dollars to pay for Michelles trip.\nTell your friends about this  its their TAX money, too!\nFULL ANSWER\nOn June 7, President Barack Obama wrapped up an overseas trip that included a major speech at Cairo University in Egypt, a visit to Saudi Arabia and Germany, and a 65th anniversary commemoration of D-Day in France. The president flew back to Washington, D.C., but his wife, Michelle, her mother and daughters went to London for two days of vacation. The chain e-mail above alleges that this vacation time was financed by taxpayer money, saying that while \"millions of Americans  wont be able to take their family on a summer vacation  theyll still be expected to fork over the tax dollars to pay for Michelles trip.\"\nNo Taxpayer Money for Personal Expenses\nIt is true that the Obamas visited Westminster Abbey, as well as a well-known local pub in Mayfair, as the e-mail says. The Obamas also visited Big Ben and Parliament. As an added treat for Sasha Obamas 8th birthday, the Obama girls met the actors from the \"Harry Potter\" movies. But the Obamas paid for their own personal expenses  not U.S. taxpayers. Katie McCormick Lelyveld, Michelle Obamas press secretary, told FactCheck.org in an e-mail: \"All personal travel and expenses incurred were paid for personally.\"\nCost of Security\nThe e-mail also questions the expenses for security for the family, saying that Michelle Obamas motorcade \"shut down [a] London street.\" President Obama has himself been criticized for similar reasons  in one instance, for flying with his wife to New York City for a date to dinner and a Broadway show. As was the case with Michelle Obamas vacation, the Obamas personally paidfor dinner and the tickets to the show. While policy dictates that tax money does not cover any personal expenses, the cost of security has historically been placed on the taxpayer.\nDuring any given trip, local law enforcement plays a big role in protecting presidents and their families. However, the United States Secret Service is the primary agency used to protect presidents, their families and some other members of an administration. According to the Congressional Research Service, the Secret Service is charged with protecting not only current presidents, vice presidents and their families, but also former presidents, children of former presidents under the age of 16, visiting heads of foreign states and other distinguished foreign visitors, and major presidential and vice presidential candidates. The same even goes for former vice presidents: Former Vice President Dick Cheney recently requested an additional six months of secret service protection  a request which was granted by President Obama.\n Andrew Karter\nSources",

    "explanation": "The internal validation suggests a plausible connection between the image and the caption, assigning a confidence score of 8. The image shows a person working on a laptop in Westminster Abbey, which could be related to administrative tasks for a vaccination site. However, the external validation reveals a significant discrepancy.  External sources do not corroborate the claim of a Covid-19 vaccination site operating in Westminster Abbey.  The external source mentions the Abbey being closed to tourists during a visit, not for vaccination purposes. This creates a substantial conflict between the visual interpretation and external factual information. The external check's lower confidence score of 8 reflects the lack of direct evidence supporting the vaccination site claim, but the information does highlight a potentially different event at the Abbey. Because of the contradictory evidence, the overall confidence is significantly lowered. The visual evidence alone isn't sufficient to confirm the caption's claim without corroborating external evidence. The internal validation's interpretation relies on an assumption that the laptop user is involved with a vaccination site, an assumption that is not supported by the external context. The discrepancy between the internal and external assessments leads to a conclusion that the caption is out of context. The low confidence score reflects the uncertainty resulting from the conflict between internal plausibility and the lack of external verification.",

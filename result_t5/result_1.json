        "content": "Americas economy has almost doubled in size over the last four decades, but broad measures of the nations economic health conceal the unequal distribution of gains. A small portion of the population has pocketed most of the new wealth, and the coronavirus pandemic is laying bare the consequences of the unequal distribution of prosperity.\nConsider first the most commonly quoted measure of the nations success  gross domestic product  in the chart below:\nIncomes have stagnated. But not for the rich.\nOne way to think about the rise in inequality is to imagine how different the economy would be if inequality hadnt soared over the past 40 to 50 years. In that scenario, with the same G.D.P. that we have today but with 1980 levels of inequality, every American household in the bottom 90 percent of income would be earning about $12,000 more  not just this year, but permanently.\nIn effect, each household in this bottom 90 percent is sending a check for $12,000 to every household in the top 1 percent, year after year after year.\nSince Jan. 1, 2011, a family in the bottom 90 percent has effectively given the rich ...\nThe stagnation of income for most Americans has caused a sharp decline in arguably the most salient definition of economic progress: Do you earn more than your parents did at the same age?\nThe answer was yes for 92 percent of Americans born in 1940. Even if they had to cope with unemployment, divorce, illness or another financial challenge, almost all grew up to out-earn their parents (controlling for inflation). Among Americans born in 1980, however, the share was only 50 percent. Living the American dream is now akin to a coin flip.\nAnother way to see how inequality has skyrocketed: The changing ratio between the pay of C.E.O.s and the pay of typical workers:\nOver this same period, taxes on the wealthy have also fallen much more than for any other group.\nBoomers are richer. The rest are poorer.\nThe trends on wealth are, if anything, starker.\nIn 2016 the median American household had a lower net worth  about 30 percent lower  than the median household in 2007. How could this be, given the bull market during much of that period? The answer is that most Americans own little or no stock. Their main asset is their home.\nThe affluent, of course, do tend to own stock, and the median net worth of the richest 10 percent of households rose 13 percent from 2007 to 2016 (the last year for which the Fed has released data).\nThe trends are similar over the long term.\nOverall, the richest 0.1 percent of American households own 19.6 percent of the nations total wealth, up from 15.9 percent in 2005 and 7.4 percent in 1980. The richest 0.1 percent now have the same combined net worth as the bottom 85 percent.\nThe wealth trends have been especially hard on younger Americans. The median net worth of Americans under age 35  who started off substantially poorer on average than older Americans  is 40 percent lower than the net worth of Americans under 35 was in 2004. The net worth of Americans over age 65, by contrast, has risen 9 percent over the same period. The Boomers, in short, are richer than their predecessors, and Millennials and Generation X are poorer than their predecessors.\nRacial inequities have also widened. The median wealth of white households is now 10 times higher than the median wealth of black households. In 1992, the multiple was seven to one.\nThe rich live longer than the rest.\nThe trends in health and life expectancy are also deeply worrisome.\nRich and poor Americans used to have fairly similar lifespans. Now, however, Americans in the bottom fourth of the income distribution die about 13 years younger on average than those in the top fourth.\nNo other rich country has suffered such slow growth in life expectancy. In 1980, Americans lived roughly as long as the British and French did. Not anymore:\nOne cause: The uniquely expensive and inefficient medical system in the United States. Treatments, procedures and drugs all cost more than in other countries. Those premiums lift the incomes of companies and people in the health care sector, but they come at the expense of other Americans.\nAnother reason for the widening gap is deaths of despair  from suicide, alcoholism and drug abuse. The rate of these deaths among American adults (ages 25 to 64) without a four-year college degree has nearly tripled since the early 1990s. More now die from these causes than from cancer.\nFor Americans with a college degree, the deaths of despair rate has risen only modestly over the same period  and is now less than one-fourth as high as it is for people without a degree.\nSmoking rates have fallen much more for the affluent than the poor. Only 7 percent of adults with income above $100,000 smoke. About 14 percent of adults with income between $35,000 and $100,000 smoke, as do 21 percent with income below $35,000.\nDaily life has also become significantly harder for Americans on the wrong side of the class divide. The chronic-pain gap has widened, with about 60 percent of adults without a college degree experiencing neck, back or joint pain.\nAnd a larger share of Americans  especially men  are not working than in the past. Many of them arent looking for work, which means they arent counted as officially unemployed. The group includes former factory workers who have not been able to find decent-paying new jobs.\nThe decline of labor unions plays a role in many of these trends. Without collective bargaining, many workers struggle to receive wages that keep up with the growth of their companys profits. Many also feel less connected to their company and to their colleagues than they once did.\nFamily life has diverged\nA greater share of children in the United States live with only one parent  23 percent  than in any other country.\nThe trend has been driven mostly by the rise of single-parent families among the middle class and poor.\nAbout 77 percent of upper-income Americans between the ages of 25 and 55 are married. Only 29 percent of low-income Americans are.\nEducational outcomes have diverged too\nThere has been a surge of college-going among children from all economic groups over the last few decades. But there has not been a surge in the share of lower- and middle-income students who graduate from college.\nMany of those who fail to finish college end up with the miserable combination of student debt and no degree. The number of higher-income students who finish college, however, has risen sharply.\nResearch has consistently shown that the benefits of college  in terms of income, health and happiness  are large, but that those benefits accrue overwhelmingly to graduates rather than to people who merely earn some credits.\nOne reason for the growing inequality in college graduation has been sharp cuts in states spending on higher education. These cuts have left colleges with fewer resources and also led to big tuition increases, even after taking financial aid into account.\nGiven all of this, it makes sense that so many Americans have soured on their own country. For almost 20 years, through economic booms and busts and through presidencies of both parties, most Americans have said the country was headed in the wrong direction.\nTheyre right about that.",

However, it does not directly quote David Leonhardt or make the claim about wealthy families paying taxes on their main asset. While the article discusses wealth inequality and tax burdens, it does not explicitly support the entire statement in the news caption. Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks the specific attribution to Leonhardt and the direct comparison of tax burdens across different wealth levels.",

    "explanation": "The image depicts a \"For Sale\" sign in front of a house. This visually supports the caption's reference to a house as an asset, aligning with the initial part of the caption's statement about houses being the biggest asset for most families. However, the image lacks any visual representation of David Leonhardt or any information pertaining to his views on taxes, making the core argument of the caption about his opinion and the comparison of tax burdens on different wealth levels visually unsupported.  The internal validation check correctly identifies this disconnect between the visual content and the caption's assertion about David Leonhardt's opinion.  The external validation check supports this conclusion by showing that while the statement about houses being the biggest asset for many is factual, the attribution to Leonhardt and the specific comparison regarding tax burdens on the middle class and wealthy families lacks direct support from external sources.  The discrepancy lies not in the factual basis of the house-as-an-asset claim, but in the additional elements related to David Leonhardt's opinion and the comparative tax burden claims, which are not visually represented in the image and are not explicitly and directly supported by verifiable information.  The external validation correctly points out the lack of direct evidence to support those specific statements, but it focuses more on the lack of explicit quotes from Leonhardt. The overall validation result confirms that the caption's core statement on Leonhardt's opinion and the comparative tax statements go beyond what is visually supported in the image, leading to a final assessment of \"out of context\". The confidence score reflects the certainty in identifying the visual-textual mismatch and the support provided by both internal and external checks, while acknowledging the partial accuracy of the initial house-as-asset claim.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external validation checks agree that the caption is out of context. The image only shows a house for sale, while the caption makes claims about David Leonhardt's opinions on wealth taxes and their impact on different income groups. These claims lack visual support in the image and require external verification, which is partially unsupported."

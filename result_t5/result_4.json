        "content": "Every day, hundreds of men, women and children cross the Rio Grande on inflatable mattresses, hoping to eventually live in the United States. Nearby, in Mexican towns close to the U.S. border, people use cardboard boxes and sheets to shield themselves from the sun as they rest on pavement because local shelters are full.\nThey are waiting for a chance to seek asylum in the U.S., an option most have not had for the past three years.\nSince March 2020, border officials have used a public health policy to quickly expel people arriving at the southern border, essentially blocking their ability to apply for asylum.\nWhen the U.S. COVID-19 public health emergency expires May 11, so will the policy, known as Title 42.\nWhat does this mean for the bottleneck of migrants in Mexico seeking asylum in the U.S., and for the U.S. government trying to mitigate their arrival?\nEl Paso, Texas, which borders Mexicos Ciudad Jurez, issued a \"declaration of disaster\" ahead of the policys expiration, citing humanitarian, security and economic crises.\nThe declaration said the Mexican government estimates that about 15,000 people are camped in Ciudad Jurez \"awaiting an opportunity to cross the border.\"\nThe Biden administration plans to send an additional 1,500 active duty troops to support immigration officials at the southern border (2,500 National Guard troops have been stationed there since October). Military personnel will not interact with migrants, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Instead, they will help border officials with administrative tasks, such as entering data.\nPresident Joe Biden has overseen historic high migration since his inauguration in 2021, and experts believe this will not subside once Title 42 is lifted.\nFor many migrants fearing for their safety in their home countries, applying for asylum is their best bet for a new life in the United States. But its no guarantee.\nPolitiFact decided to take a closer look at the immigration laws governing asylum and how the U.S. is preparing for an influx of arrivals at the southern border.\nHaga clic aqu para leer este artculo en espaol.\nWhat people must prove to get asylum in the U.S.\nThe reason for so many arrivals was baked into U.S. immigration law, long before Biden took office.\nPeople seeking asylum must be on U.S. soil.\nPeople can request asylum whether they arrived here legally at an airport or crossed the southern border without authorization.\nBefore 2013, the majority of asylum seekers weren't walking up to the U.S.- Mexico border, \"they were coming through airports,\" said Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser for immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washnington. D.C., think tank.\n\"Safe pathways have really been cut back and so asylum seekers and others have no choice but to amass at the border, and that's what's creating this situation at the border,\" said Jaya Ramji-Nogales, an immigration law professor at Temple University.\nAsylees must meet the U.S. definition for refugees: People who are unable or unwilling to return to their home countries because of a \"persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\"\nAsylum rule meant to be the exception has become the norm\nIn the 1990s, U.S. Border Patrol encountered mainly Mexican men traveling alone who wanted to come to the U.S. because they couldnt find good-paying jobs in Mexico. They often were trying to evade immigration authorities.\nTo counter this illegal immigration, Congress passed a law in 1996 that established expedited removal  a process to quickly deport people who were apprehended after crossing the southern border.\nBut the law carved out an exception for people who said they feared returning to their home countries and wanted to apply for asylum. Instead of being quickly deported, they were eligible for interviews with asylum officers, and then detained or released into the U.S. to wait for an immigration judge to hear their cases.\nMost Mexican migrants coming to the U.S. for economic reasons typically didnt seek asylum, so this exception to expedited removal was rarely used in the 1990s. But that has changed.\nToday, most people reaching the border are seeking asylum. Since the 2010s, and before the public health policy largely halted asylum, most people at the border who were placed into expedited removal used the exception to seek asylum, Brown said.\nSince 2014, border officials mainly encounter families and children coming alone and fleeing gang violence, political instability and climate crises in their home countries. Extreme poverty is also a key driver  especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Most migrants are from Central and South America.\nUnlike the Mexican migrants of the 1990s, todays asylum seekers are not trying to avoid immigration officials, said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. He said that migrants are telling authorities: \"Hi, I'm here looking for a Border Patrol agent  Yes, I'm applying for asylum.\"\nMigrants walk toward the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, on April 30, 2023. (AP)\nHow the Biden administration plans to deal with an immigration spike post-Title 42\nThe pandemic made it much harder to apply for asylum in the United States. Immigration experts expect Title 42s expiration will lead to a bottleneck of asylum applications.\nU.S. immigration officials expect to encounter twice as many people at the southern border without this public health rule in place. The Biden administration has laid out several policies to prepare for the influx.\nSince January, the U.S. is letting up to 30,000 immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua enter the country under a parole program and live and work in the U.S. for two years. Its unclear what immigration status they will have after two years.\nMeanwhile, Mexico agreed to continue accepting, on humanitarian grounds, people from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua who are turned away by U.S. border authorities (up to 30,000 people a month).\nIllegal immigration from those countries has dropped significantly. In December, before the new policy took effect, U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped migrants from those countries more than 84,000 times. That number was down to less than 4,000 in March.\nThe Biden administration in January launched a smartphone app to let migrants exempt from Title 42 schedule asylum appointments at official ports of entry. (U.S. policy exempts children traveling alone and people from countries that have strained relations with the U.S.) Once Title 42 is lifted, the app will become available to any migrant who is in central and northern Mexico.\nMigrants and immigration advocates have said the app doesnt offer sufficient appointments and has technical glitches.\nA migrant from Michoacan, Mexico, uses the CBPOne app, Jan. 24, 2023, in Tijuana, Mexico. (AP)\nA proposed rule would require all asylum seekers to use the app to schedule an appointment in the U.S. Migrants who dont do this must prove they unsuccessfully applied for asylum in another country before reaching the U.S.; otherwise, immigration officials will presume they are ineligible for asylum.\nTo deter people from trekking to the southern border, the Biden administration is opening regional migration centers in Colombia and Guatemala. Immigrants can schedule interviews with specialists who will help them determine their legal options for entering the U.S., staying in the country where the center is located, or migrating to Canada or Spain.\nSo far, there is little information on how these centers will be run or when they will open.\nThe White House forwarded PolitiFacts request for comment to DHS. The agency did not weigh in.\nWill these new policies lead to fewer people seeking asylum at the southern border?\nThats unclear, because some of these policies could be challenged in court.\n\"What the world after May 11 will look like may actually get determined more by a federal district court judge than by (Homeland) Secretary (Alejandro) Mayorkas,\" Chishti, of the Migration Policy Institute, said.\nMigrants line up after being detained by U.S. authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border in Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, April 30, 2023. (AP)\nWhy people arent getting in line\nImages of masses of people trying to enter the southern border often prompt some elected officials and pundits to question why these migrants arent coming here \"the right way\" or \"getting in line.\"\nThe problem with that argument is that \"there's not a line,\" said Ramji-Nogales. \"It's very difficult to get here legally.\"\nThere are limited paths for people to come to the U.S. legally, mainly through family or an employer. A U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident can \"sponsor\" legal migration for their parents, siblings and spouses. But that can take one to more than 20 years to materialize, depending on immigrants country of origin and their relationship to the sponsor.\nNinety percent of asylum applicants enter the U.S. without authorization, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\n\"Weve just made it so difficult to get to the United States or to get any other type of visa,\" Brown said.\nSome people also come in legally as refugees, but that vetting and approval process isnt immediate, either.\nMost asylum seekers dont have time to wait years for those alternatives, said Claire Thomas, director of the Asylum Clinic at New York Law School.\nShe said: \"Especially if youre in danger, like, Oh the house is burning, Im going to wait in the burning house for 20 or 30 years? No, right? That doesn't work.\"",

    "explanation": "The internal and external validation checks both support the assertion that the image depicts asylum seekers waiting in line at a border location in Mexico. The internal check highlights the visual evidence of individuals standing near a border fence, consistent with the description in the caption.  The external check provides further support by citing a news source containing images of migrants lined up at the US-Mexico border in a nearby city, Ciudad Juarez, around the same time period mentioned in the caption. While there's a slight discrepancy in the exact location (Tijuana versus Ciudad Juarez), these cities are geographically proximate, and the overall context of asylum seekers waiting at the border remains consistent.  The external source also reinforces the timeframe, tying the event to the expiration of Title 42, which strengthens the credibility of the caption.  The confidence score reflects the high level of agreement between both validation methods, mitigated slightly by the location discrepancy. Although the internal check is very confident, the external validation adds a degree of uncertainty considering the slight difference in location. However, the overall evidence points to a likely accurate depiction of asylum seekers waiting at the Mexico-US border. There is no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization in the original image provided.",
    "validation_summary": "Both internal and external checks support the caption's claim, with a minor discrepancy in location (Tijuana vs. Ciudad Juarez). The overall context and timeframe align, indicating a high probability that the image accurately reflects asylum seekers lining up at the Mexico-US border."

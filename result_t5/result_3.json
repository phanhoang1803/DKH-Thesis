        "content": "Claim:\nAdam Schiff used taxpayer money to silence a man who accused him of sexual harassment.\nRating:\nFalse\nAbout this rating\nIn early February 2019, social media trolls attempted to spread a claim that \"congressional sources\" had confirmed Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California) \"used taxpayer money\" to cover up a sexual-harassment accusation:\nIt's unclear where the rumor started, but on Twitter it was sometimes shared in association with a clearly bogus article from the junk news site TheNetSpies.com. That site is filled with obviously false information, and its \"About\" page states that \"If you like our reporting, kick up your feet, partake of your favorite intoxicant(s) and stay a while. If not, go ask your mommy to come down to the basement and nurse her 33 year old wuss.\"\nOn 11 February 2018, TheNetSpies.com published an article for which they alleged to have interviewed Los Angeles Times former Assistant Managing Editor Christina Bellantoni (which TheNetSpies misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). Bellantoni, they asserted, told the tale of a hapless (but non-existent) man named Will Bottom, who claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff, his \"gay lover.\" To illustrate this supposedly abusive relationship, the article repurposed an image of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn, New York, man who suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked and beaten in 2013.\nThe real Christina Bellantoni never spoke to anyone from TheNetSpies and took to Twitter to make it clear the story was falsified:\nThis isn't the only unfounded rumor to dog Schiff, who became chair of the House Intelligence Committee when Democrats won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",

        "content": "Politicians are known to be frequent targets for conspiracy rumors and scandals.\nLately, conspiracy theory peddlers have set their sights on U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat who represents Californias 28th Congressional District and recently took over as chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\nA March 21 Facebook post displays a picture of Schiff with wide eyes and says: \"Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to reach sexual harassment settlement with a 19 year old male. Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebooks efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence that Schiff paid off anyone over sexual harassment allegations, let alone used taxpayer funds to do it.\nWe found the rumor posted all over Twitter, and one December 9, 2018 tweet in particular from a QAnon conspiracy theory account, which simply claimed the information came from \"congressional sources,\" was picked up and retweeted tens of thousands of times. The rumor seems have emerged as Congress worked toward the bipartisan passage of a bill that requires members to pay their own sex misconduct settlements.\nThe rumor stretched so far that it was found in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Times on Dec. 13, 2018. That account also failed to list any sources to back up the allegation.\nA spokesperson for Schiff told PolitiFact the conspiracy theory is completely false: \"This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account. It is obviously and categorically untrue.\"\nGoing back a bit further, we discovered a story about a supposed \"gay lover\" of Schiffs on the junk news website TheNetSpies from February 2018. The site is filled with questionable content, and its \"About Us\" page states its content comes in \"the form of sizzling OP-ED, hard nosed investigative journalism, and a bit of satire for laughs.\"\nThe story claimed to have had an exclusive interview with former Los Angeles Times assistant managing editor Christina Bellantoni (which they misspelled as \"Kristina Bellatori\"). In a supposed Skype interview, Bellantoni allegedly told the site a man named \"Will Bottom\" claimed to be in an abusive relationship with Schiff. The NetSpies posted a picture of the abused man, but the photo is actually of Taj Patterson, a Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013.\nBellantoni got wind of the story months later (around the time the rumor was spreading across Twitter) and called it out as fake in a tweet.\n\"Thanks for flagging. This is some very seriously fake news,\" Bellantoni wrote. \"Clue No. 1: A website youve never heard of citing an LAT story that doesnt exist.\"\nOur ruling\nViral social media posts claim that Schiff used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment allegation with a \"a 19-year-old male.\"\nDespite the rapid spreading of the rumor, not a single credible news source picked up the story. The account could only be found in sporadic, unsourced social media posts and partially in a junk news website that used a fabricated interview and a phony photo.\nThis conspiracy theory is full-on Pants on Fire!",

    "explanation": "The internal check correctly identifies Adam Schiff in the image, giving a true verdict with a confidence score of 10. However, the external check reveals that the claim in the caption is false, with a confidence score of 10.  The external check cites two reputable sources (Snopes and PolitiFact) that thoroughly debunk the claim that Schiff used taxpayer money to silence a sexual harassment accuser.  These sources trace the rumor's origin to a junk news site and provide evidence such as a Schiff spokesperson's denial and a lack of credible reporting to support their findings. The discrepancy lies in the caption's factual inaccuracy, despite the image's correct identification of Adam Schiff.  Given the overwhelming evidence from the external sources that the caption's central claim is false, the caption is deemed out of context. There is no visual evidence of tampering or miscontextualization; the image simply shows Adam Schiff. The visual information does not contradict the external information; rather, the problem is the caption's false statement.",
